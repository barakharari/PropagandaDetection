So how good is he? How good is he?  n Special
He is a special man and special person
And he has become my friend
Oh there is a lot of people here
Your football team is going to have a great year
Youve got the quarterback youve got the whole deal
I think its going to be a very good year
n OK? And if you get into that Super Bowl I will be going all right?n So you know I wrote something down before and I think it is important because -- I love you too
 n "Because we need unity we have to win this election
This is truly one of the most important elections certainly in my lifetime
Because we are about to go -- we lose it we are in the wrong direction and maybe its gone
Supreme Court justices always remember that
But so many different levels and when you see what happened with crooked Hillary today it was a disaster
She lies folks she lies badly
 n So I want to -- I just wrote this out
I wanted to say to the group you know I had a great time when I was in Wisconsin and I did not quite eke it out
I thought I was going to but after that it worked out well
You built me up you taught me about politics.n "And when I left here I said I think Ive learned a lot
n "So I love it
I have many friends in Wisconsin
And theyre -- theyre incredible people
Youre incredible people I have to tell you that
n "And were going to have a lot of fun
We are going to have a lot of fun but I had to write this
This campaign is not about me or any one candidate
n "It is time for a change
A real change not an Obama change
We dont need an Obama change
It is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders and replace it with a government that serves the people
n "Have to do it
Ive been on the other side
I actually like this side better; this is a movement
This is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country according to even the political pundits that truly hate me OK? This is a -- they -- oh this is a movement that some say most say is one of the great phenomenons that theyve ever seen in politics.n
"Some say its the single greatest phenomenon
n "Though the media doesnt want to talk about it we have done something -- we
Im a messenger; Im only a messenger
We have done something truly historic together standing before you as nominee for president and Im not a politician proudly
n "Im not part of the system
I ran against the system and Im probably better off running against the system
n "I ran against the donors
Im my own donor essentially
I have a lot of money under this deal
This is a very expensive crisis I want to tell you
n "I funded -- as you know I funded the primaries
And Im in for under $60 million and Im largely funding my campaign as we go forward
In addition to that -- in addition to that we have raised tremendous amounts of money and much of it from small donors$61; $61
As a Republican that doesnt happen
It happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today.n
And if you remember just prior to June they did a story "Donald Trump has not really done too well with fund raising.
Well that is because I did not even know if I was getting the nomination
Im not going to raise funds -- I wouldve had enough if I didnt make it
I would have said "Bye bye politics."n But I wanted to make sure -- so I got it
And then I started raising money for the Republican Party
and we raised a lot of money
We started really on June 14th Flag Day my birthday
 n And in June we raised approximately -- think of this -- $51 million
Can you imagine?  n "And those people couldnt believe it; they were really surprised
Because they dont give me too many good headlines
I could do the greatest things
I do things that I think a fantastic.n
"I say good there is no way they cover this badly
And they cover it badly
I gently tell a woman that I love her baby and let the baby cry
As the baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti continued to cry -- I remember I told her to stay dont worry maam.n
"But after about 3 or 4 minutes and Im trying to speak and it was in Jacksonville we had this massive massive crowd filled up the stadium
So I said maam I would like to reverse my order
Perhaps you could nicely take -- take the baby out
I did it so nicely
Even the baby was happy
 n And maybe you could take the baby out would that be possible? The whole place was cracking up
And the next day in the newspaper it said "Trump throws baby out of arena."n Terrible
Now they are very dishonest
That was a tough one when I -- and I just had a reporter come up to me backstage a reporter come up -- "Mr
Trump sir but why did you throw that baby out of the area?
I said "I was having fun
I was so nice I was so nice
The baby liked me the mother liked me
We had a good time
I try to keep the baby in but the baby was such -- had such a powerful voice  n "In fact I want to find out who that baby is because I want to sponsor the baby
And that baby will sing someday in Philharmonic Hall
n "So Im not part of the system
I ran against the system
I ran against the donors because Im largely my own donor
Thats sort of -- never thought of it that way
And against the status quo and the status quo we have to get rid of because it is not working folks because the country is a mess
n And that is why put up a lot of money
But while the Democrats nominated the candidate of special interests and really a candidate of total corruption I mean you take a look at what she is doing the Republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very very corrupt the system
It is a corrupt system.n "Its a corrupt system
You want something done they can do it for you
And that is not necessarily and usually it isnt good for the country.n
"That is why were going to be able to deliver real change and real safety and real opportunity to all Americans
"Everything Ive accomplished I have done by putting together a really fantastic team including Governor Mike Pence of Indiana who has done an incredible..
n "Done an incredible job
My wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing and they are working so hard
My family friends and its expanding all the time.n
But I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make
We have to make them right?  n "I understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagans big tent within the party big big tent remember? Ronald Reagan great man great guy
Remember he included Reagan Democrats and Independents and Republicans a lot of people
Were going to have the same thing
There a lot of Democrats perhaps in this room are there a lot of Democrats? Raise your hands
I mean I dont think we need too many to be honest with you but -- so I embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy Ronald Reagan
n Stated by Ronald Reagan pretty good.n We will be the big tent party
We are going to have a lot of cross help
We are going to have a lot of Bernie Sanders people coming in because of trade because Bernie Sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade
Trade is a disaster with China with Japan with Mexico with Vietnam with so many countries with every country every country.n "We dont win at any level with anything and as a unified party we will lead our country to unity as well very important
We need the unity we have to win the election
n "No we have to win it --- have to win it
Otherwise our big movement was not as big as we thought and thats not good
Thats why November 8th youve got to get everybody you know -- and you know all this voter ID nowadays a lot of places arent going to have voter ID
Now what does that mean? What does that mean? You just keep walking in and voting? So you have to be very careful very vigilant -- you have to be carefuln
But we will have disagreements but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory and very importantly toward real change
 n So in our shared mission to make America great again I support and endorse our speaker of the House Paul Ryan
 n "Paul Ryan hes good
Hes a good man and hes a good guy
And we may disagree on a couple of things but mostly we agree and were going get it done and were going to do a lot of wonderful things
n "Hes a good man
And while Im at it I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office and I fully support and endorse his re-election
I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire
n "A state I truly love primarily because that was my first victory but I love New Hampshire
No I love New Hampshire one of the most beautiful places
Shes a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long long time
n "Working hand-in-hand we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate
We need that weve got to get things done
Arm in arm we will rescue the nation from the Obama-Clinton disaster which is exactly what it is that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world thats whats happening
You saw it just now Maps came out yesterday they said ISIS far bigger its all over the place
Its all over the place
Were going to get rid of it folks
n "Our military is depleted
Were going to build up our military we are going to get others with us
Believe me were going to get plenty of others with us
And speaking of others wouldnt it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia? Wouldnt that be nice? 
n "They talk so big and so brave and so tough theyre the tough ones
You know Hillarys real tough give me a break
Wouldnt that be great? We get along with Russia we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of ISIS wouldnt that be great? 
n "Together we will lead our country back to prosperity security and peace
OK? When you look at the world and whats happened -- so we have the queen of corruption shes the queen of corruption
I said before if crooked Hillary Clinton becomes president terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country
Believe me they are loving it.n
"She wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and that region into our nation
And we dont know who they are we dont know where they come from really we dont know if theyre ISIS some will be
And look at the damage thats done in San Bernardino with a couple -- probably he became radicalized by her -- a couple and these were friends of theirs
These were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down 14 people killed many many injured.n
"Take a look at Orlando -- take a look at Orlando how disgusting that was
Take a look at the World Trade Center and so many other places
Go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world go to Paris and take a look at that 130 people gunned down
You know if people had guns on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction like you sir you sir you and you maam
n "First of all if they knew guns were in the room they probably wouldnt have gone there
They were just sitting ducks 130 people
In San Bernardino you had 14 people.n
"But in Paris just like this boom -- get over here boom -- get over here boom -- 130 people with many still in the hospital many so gravely wounded
And if they had bullets flying in the other direction maybe they wouldnt have shown up and if they did Ill tell you what you wouldnt have had that kind of carnage
You would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead
n "So Hillary Clinton wants to do major damage as you know to our Second Amendment
Hillary Clinton wants to put judges -- she wants to put justices of the Supreme Court -- shes going to make them nice and liberal wait until -- wait until you see what that does to your rights
Wait until you see what that does to your Second Amendment
You will not recognize it you will not recognize it
National Rifle Association NRA endorsed me
n "Theyre great people Wayne -- theyre great people Chris they love this country
They endorsed me very early and its really a -- its really an honor
Ill tell you what they are phenomenal people when you get to know them
They love the country -- you know they love the country
They take a lot of heat but they love the country Ill tell you that right now.n
"And I heard Mike Governor Pence talking about 1.2 growth -- 1.2 percent growth the lowest in memory since the 1940s
When you think about it its the lowest
So a lot of differences between all of us but I thought I would mention -- because Ive known Hillary Clinton over the years -- I know her -- and she makes statements
She makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook.n
Well lets see "we cant get them for this -- cant get them for this.
Ive always heard that I have the best temperament people tell me I have the best temperament I have a temperament to win
We got to win n She said not so long ago "I dont like Donald Trumps tone"
Now she is reading it off teleprompters only
"I dont like Donald trumps tone.
And I said you know "we need a tough tone today
We have people -- we need a kind tone but we need a tough tone."n We have people being beheaded all over the Middle East and other places
We have crime that is rampant
We have people in the Middle East being drowned in steel cages
This is like medieval times and she is worried about my tone.n So they chop off heads and they drown people and they bury people in sand
And then they ask me "Mr
-- at one of the debates in which I won Im very happy about that -- "Mr
Trump sir how do you feel about waterboarding?
Im seeing chopped off heads drowned people burying in sand -- I said "Im absolutely OK with it let me tell you.
 n Can you imagine what the enemy must say -- can you imagine the enemy -- ISIS in this case -- can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of Christians -- "come back get together and start talking -- and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the United States -- by the United States waterboarding is not allowed."n Folks we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with Hillary we are playing games
It is just games she is not the right person and everybody knows it
Her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it
 n This is true 33000 e-mails
 n "So I wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place thats very full and very nice in Iowa
And we love Iowa dont we yes? Right? 
n I thought it was accurate unstable -- and she is she is unstable
Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment that Bernie Sanders had
You just have to pay attention as soon as he said it I started writing notes
 n "She has bad judgment
She lacks the judgment temperament and moral character to lead this country
Plus she is a weak person.
We dont need a weak person
He just said "plus she is a criminal."n She is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of Americans and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy
We have a long way to go.n She is unhinged shes truly unhinged and she is unbalanced totally unbalanced
And you can see in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book I bought the book I wanted to see what he had to say; "she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office."n "From my bottom of my soul
he said "I know this to be true.
"Her leadership style volcanic impulsive as it is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasnt changed a bit
Shes unqualified to become president.
And she really is and Bernie said that too
Wow.n "No but it is true no games it is true
In one way she is a monster OK? Look at what happened look at her history
In another way she is a weak person she is actually not strong enough to be president
So shes got both but she is not strong enough to be president.n
"She will be a be a disaster
She will be so bad for our country and Im not just talking about Justices of the Supreme Court
She will be so bad for our country and we cant let it happen
We cant let it happen.n
You know Mike Pence told me a story and maybe I should not say it but I found it interesting but of the reasons -- I guess the primary reason that hes in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the Clintons when they were in the White House
And he said "he ran he ran again and he ran again and he won.
You have to hand it to him this is the guy that does not give up
 n "But he watched the Clintons -- and Im sure they will be thrilled to hear that -- but that actually got him into politics which is interesting.n
So then we make these horrible deals; Iran Deal horrible deal we got $150 billion -- and how about $400 million -- think of it $400 million in cash different currencies different denominations
Now lot of people say that money went toward terrorn "Im nicer than that see I dont have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have
I say some of it went to terror but a lot of it went into their bank accounts believe me thats the way it is
It went into their pockets can you imagine these guys sitting there with $400 million in cash? You think theyre giving that money to terror they are giving that money to them and I guess terror got some of it but most of it they kept.n
I mean the concept of paying $400 million in cash is mind- boggling
I mean you wouldnt think -- who can authorize such a thing? Where did they get it? What did they do go to a bank teller and say "give me $400 million in cash? I want to in euros I want it in Swiss francs wrap it up we will come back in 10 minutes."n I mean it is just inconceivable
So we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world
You look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people these people funding terror -- these people are funding terrorism
For us to have given $400 million to basically free our hostages.n Now Obama just like he lied about Obamacare which was a tremendous lie that was a tremendous lie remember? "You can keep your plan you can keep your doctor.
Really? How many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan?n Keep your plan keep your doctor -- not working that way folks
By the way it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent
 n "And -- and honestly I hope I win because we will do a great job
We are going to make America great again
Were going to make America great again
n "But I actually think that regardless of who wins Obamacare is going to fold in any event
People cant afford it and the country cant afford it
Other than that it is just wonderful
So in Texas they just had almost a 60 percent increase
Now the increases are starting to come out
The big increase is going to be announced on November 1st
The election is November 8th
Folks they want to delay it because it is election-changing
"It is election changing and they want to change it
And we cant let that happen.n
"Because the numbers -- and I can see some of the numbers already -- the numbers are going to be astronomical
They are going to be astronomical
Theyre going to be so big so horrible and the health care you know the plan is terrible
And were going to take care of everybody but were going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country.n
"This plan is a total rip
It does not work so its going to fall because economically it is a disaster for the country too.n
"But what about people where they said they had a 30 40 50 60 percent increase? And its going to be worse than that I predict on November 1st.n
"So wed better get smart and wed better start thinking properly.n
Now I want to talk about what is going on at the borders because money..
 n "Oh were going to build it.n
So listen so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country 
We have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country.n "Most of the politicians almost all of them dont even know where they are where they are being put they know nothing about these people
This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time
And Hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above Obama
So tall -- and the wall is getting taller every day
 n If you think of this I just wrote this the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions of Iraq Libya and Syria to ISIS
It has undermined stability in Egypt and you know what they have to do over there
And empowered Iran as never before
Iran three years ago was -- was dying
In fact when they were marching in the streets if Obama would have just encouraged them a little more it would have been taken over by the people.n "But Obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now
Think of this think of this
Were making a deal and the deal is not made and they are dancing in the streets of Iran saying how stupid the Americans are to be making this deal.n
The leaders and in particular the leader of Iran is calling us stupid and the deal means nothing.n And yesterday I think he just said that the United States is essentially nothing.n This is our -- this is our great great partner.n "But when you have somebody -- if I was making this deal and if the other side was bragging about it the deal wasnt made Im not making that deal
But we kept it going and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back
OK?  n "We should have walked
We should have doubled up the sanctions and walked
And they would have -- and I say it
Before the plane reached New York City or Washington you could just turn it around because theyll call you theyll say lets go
But when you think about it you probably read today and yesterday one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time
Now Obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages
That he would not do that for kidnappers.n "He would not do that for kidnapping
OK? No no think of that
You have got to think about it
He wouldnt do it -- now it was the same day right same day
We have to be exactly accurate because theyll catch us right? Same day.n
"The money came in and one of the hostages a good guy I saw him interview on television
Btu didnt he say he waited forever he waited
And somebody said nope we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in.n
And here Obama stands up yesterday and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other
You know at least be truthful
 n "And were talking about the same day $400 million and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal
And you know what Im all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear
But we could have made it -- we should have walked
And we should have walked with $150 too; we have said sorry we dont have the money cant pay
We dont have the money
We owe almost $20 trillionn
"Im sorry fellas we love you we think youre the greatest guys on Earth
But we cant give you the money
And they will get angry and they will be upset and two days later youll be back negotiating.n
You just saved yourself $150 billion right? Hundred and -- $150 billion
 n "So we have terrorists pouring into our country we have people coming in
I dont know if you saw this in Maine -- and Maine knows because Maine is -- I was up there yesterday -- a great place
A great governor great governor
Paul is doing a great job.n
"And I think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism
And we have a president that refuses to use the term and we have crooked Hillary who does not want to use it
Now shes being forced to use it by me.n
Did you notice she gave a speech she said I will use it
She called it I think radical Islam
But she said I will use it
Just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership
She called it the gold standard
It is a horror show.n "Its almost as bad or maybe its going to worse than NAFTA signed by her husband which cleaned out many of the states in our country cleaned them out from manufacturing
Moved to Mexico and other places
NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton
He never suffered the ravages because he signed it then he got out and other people did suffer with it.n "But we are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if they dont want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back at least a lot of them if we cant make a great deal -- and she cant do that by the way if she wanted to.n
Number one her donors would not let her
Her special interests would never let her
Her lobbyists would never let her.n Number three she could not do it anyway
Even if she wanted to.n "But were going to renegotiate
And did you hear her the other day? After years of saying how wonderful it is even though you look at New England and you look at New York state and you look at Pennsylvania and Ohio if you look at a lot of other places one of the reasons I won Indiana so big -- well one of the reasons was the great Bobby Knight OK?n
 n "Thats gold standard right? As she said about TPP
But one of the reasons I won was because Carrier Air Conditioning was moving to Mexico from Indiana and they let go of 1400 people.n
"And Ive been talking about this and I know how to stop it and youve heard me before so easy to stop
There have to be consequences when Mexico takes our companies
And not only Mexico; there have to be consequences when China devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with China even though we make better product.n
"I have friends who are manufacturers
They cant get their product into China And when a few times arise where they can they have to pay an incredible tax beyond what anybody would even think costs
But yet we open our doors and just throw away your stuff and we lose our jobs and it is very very said.n
"But look as many know a major destination -- Maine has become a major destination for Somali refugees
We admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the United States from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world
And you are getting them here too folks you just dont know it because you just dont know.n
"Anybody in this room -- anybody in this room from a terror territory? All right a practice -- and this is a practice which will continue under Hillary Clinton except it will expand five six seven fold
I mean I know they will vote Democrat OK thats what I know but they will not be voting for a long time.n
I just -- I dont get it how can anybody even think this way? Now the Washington Times reported "of the Somali refugees -- the program in Minnesota -- that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net
-- tremendous problems for safety -- "and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the Islamic terror groupsn Arent we smart? We are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs
Here are some of the examples -- I will give you a few examples and this came out of the Senate subcommittee just recently
-- remember those horrible disgusting people? "The Boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process.n The younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11 2012
The older brother had a pending application for citizenship.
And look what happened we took them in
Look what happened arent we smart?n The Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse
A Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs
We let him in.n An immigrant from Syria who later applied for and received U.S
citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style if possible -- more than that if at all possible.n A college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied and received U.S
citizenship attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon.n An immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S
citizenship and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al Qaida and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible -- as many as possible.n An Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S
citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS his travels to Syria and how many Americans he wanted to kill.n Two immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S
citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb -- and a very big bomb in the middle of New York City.n An immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S
citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS
He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many American military personnel as possible.n "All right folks
So I just say what are we doing? What are we doing? And Hillary Clinton wants more and more to pour in
You can almost say you know politics aside whether you are a Democrat whether you are a liberal a Republican a conservative; what are they doing? I dont care who you are what the hell are they doing? 
n So we are going to have strong borders our southern border is going to be very powerful
We are going to stop the drugs from pouring into Wisconsin and every place else
 n The heroin epidemic is beyond belief
In New Hampshire a great place that is where I realized the extent of what is going on
I met with the people of New Hampshire and they tell me "the biggest problem they have is heroin.
I said "it cant be with the beautiful lakes and streams it so beautiful.
Right and their biggest problems heroin
I said "you have to be kidding that cant be right 
Their youth is being poisoned
And then you go to Massachusetts and you go to North Carolina and South Carolina and you come here you come here -- I just left Iowa you go to Iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border
And look heres the story we are going to have strong borders
We are going to have a wall it will be a big and powerful wall -- a big powerful wall
 n You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago? She wanted a wall
And the primary research as we understand it looking back not that long ago she wanted a wall
You know walls do work folks all you have to do is ask Israel
All you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in Europe right now that are building walls.n You know its sort of interesting Obama talks about "there will be no wall.
But in the White House which he just said which is true they want to build essentially a wall they want to build a fence a lot bigger and a lot higher and a lot stronger.n You know it is interesting
I say "dont build that fence right dont build that fence
because they say "walls dont work
-- fences dont work dont build that fence."n "When Hillary doesnt want to let you have your guns she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth and I think she doesnt want to have guns
I think that all of her bodyguards and all of her Secret Service should immediately give up their weapons
n OK I mean it
They should immediately give up their weapons
They should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun you just try to talk them out of it I guess
You got to do some quick talking.n "You got to do some quick talking Hillary
I dont think even Hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits I dont think Hillary could get away with that one
n So we are going to have a little contrast
And I did this very quickly but it is so simple Hillary wants to raise taxes Trump is going to lower taxes very substantially the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on person.n Hillary wants to significantly expand regulations
 Trump is going to get rid of many many many regulations
 n "Which by the way are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding from expanding and more than anything from starting
You cant start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible.n
Hillary wants to shut down energy production
Trump wants to expand it significantly
And well start paying off our debt
n Hillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment take away your right
  Donald Trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served
 n Crooked Hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by Bernie and by Pocahontas
 n Who will destroy our Constitution
I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution
 n As close by the way to Justice Scalia who was great as we could get OK?  n Hillary wants to open our borders just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way
There are reasons I understand that
I want to totally secure our borders
But I want people to come in
But they come in through a process and they come in legally
 n Hillary wants to invade foreign countries
You ever see the one where she says "Donald Trump with the nuclear
-- Im -- I didnt want the war in Iraq
I didnt want the war in Iraq
I didnt want all of -- what theyve done
And I said if you read Esquire Magazine from a long time ago youll see everything I said was exactly right
Its going to de-stabilize the Middle East.n "I said the meanest toughest group of people the people that hate the United States and its people the most theyre going to take it over
Theyre taking over the oil theyre taking over the land theyre taking over everything
I didnt want it but Im always being accused like the war hog they think Im a tough guy the war hog
"They think she wants to be tough with Russia
So she said well Donald Trump likes Putin
I dont know Putin folks
I hope I like him I hope he likes me because Id love to get along with Russia
But she goes Donald Trump Donald Trump -- think about it -- wants to befriend Putin and other things she said right? And Im saying to myself whats wrong with that? Thats good.n
"But shes going to be the tough one see? Shes going to be the tough one
Shes going to play with nuclear weapons you know? They have all the nukes nice nukes
Shes going to be the tough one.n
"Ill tell you what you put her in the office of the president -- you know she hates Putin and Putin hates her right? Thats what I hear
No no -- Putin probably doesnt respect her more than anything else
But shes going to be tough
Were going to be tough with Russia -- oh were going to be tough right? Let me tell you were in a different world today folks
Were in a different world.n
"But she makes it sound like Im this tough guy that will have a temperament
You know she uses the word -- you know who gave her the word? Her people that write the speeches well say Trump with a temperament.n
"They said Trump in a speech with tweets
Ive got -- Ive got between Facebook and Twitter like almost 21 22 million people
Its an asset its an asset
But -- but she said -- she made the statement during her speech you know I heard it barely because I was falling asleep you couldnt watch it
Hillary wants to invade foreign countries
We did a great job there
You know a spot hit on Gaddafi maybe but I mean even that what the hell do we get out of this? Its a disaster
Then you have Benghazi then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS taking over the oil large portions of the oil
And its some of the finest oil in the world
And you have ISIS grabbing it.n
"We dont know what were doing
We have people that dont know what were doing
We have people that militarily -- in fact they said well who is your military consultants? And I give them names
But theyre not working now you know theyre not working now
And I said of course theyre not working now look what working now people have gotten us
Havoc who the hell wants the people who are working now? I mean..
n "You know a lot of its common sense and a lot of its instinct and she has very bad judgment shes got no instinct whatsoever
And when I was asked on one of the big networks about NATO they said what do you think of NATO? Now you know its not like it was my primary subject in all fairness
Ive only been doing this for 12 months
Now its actually almost 14 months hard to believe right?n
"But NATO -- so I said I know enough
And sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much
You understand you cant see the forest through the trees right? So I said NATO in my opinion is obsolete because its not covering terrorism
Obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that arent paying their fair share theyre not paying what theyre supposed to be paying
n "And were protecting those guys and were supposed to get into World War III for all these countries that arent paying their fair share
And even the commander of NATO -- and I so respect what he did
He came out the other day and he said Donald Trump is right we have cut you see thats right did you see the letter -- the big story? Donald Trump is right
Im sure Obama was thrilled when he saw that
n "Donald Trump is right; you have countries that arent paying
And he said how he goes in and he talks to them
He says look youve got to pay your bills
I have budgets -- which is true
And I have to go back to Congress and I have to say whats happening.n
They dont pay their bills though because people dont ask properly
And they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country
"Sir we owe the United States millions of dollars
Oh have they asked for the money? No
Theyll pay OKn "But I will say the commander of NATO said I was right
And then you have these people back here -- stupid people -- right here
They said Donald Trump -- now theyre the worst
They said Donald Trump -- Donald Trump doesnt like NATO
He is going to abandon NATO
Thats not what I said
I said theyve got to pay
"Now you have to walk
You may have to walk
But theyve got to pay
Were going to get in World War III for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the United States right? No theyve got to pay
And they probably will in all fairness.n
"But Hillary said about Japan -- because Japan were defending Japan you know that right? Now in all fairness before I came alone put yourself back three years ago
Did anybody know that we defend Japan? Raise your hand who knew
All right theres about 12 percent.n
I think some of you are lying OK? I think some of you are related to Hillary Rodham Clinton
I think some of you are lying
But we defend Japan and a man comes up general or something a few months ago I remember so vividly
And he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because I kept saying theyve got to pay their way
And if they dont -- if they dont you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do that.n
You know we dont want to do that I understand the reason
Itd be nice to have them but you know this isnt again 40 years ago
Were defending all these -- we defend Japan
You think they have the money to pay -- how about we have military bases that we rent -- we pay rent to Saudi Arabia to protect them? No
Think of it think of the stupidity
So this general comes up has a news conference a few months ago
Trump doesnt understand that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend them."n So a reporter goes up who I think is there and said to me "Mr
Trump wed like your comment
They say that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend.
And I said why arent they paying 100 percent? The reporter said OK.
Now heres the problem with the Hillary -- Hillary rotten Clinton
 n "Here is -- thats why she changed her last -- thats why she doesnt want to use the name anymore because everybody was saying that
"But look here is -- here is why it doesnt work for Hillary
She saw that I said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs at least right?n
Germany -- see how well theyre doing -- economic behemoth
Saudi Arabia nothing but money.n
"They were making $1 billion a day with their high oil prices now theyre making a fortune the same thing
Why are defending them and why arent we being fully reimbursed? Now if we do that your budget already is starting to look real good OK
You know you have budgets so we losing our assurance; we have an $800 billion trade deficit folks.n
We have a deficit with other countries think of it -- $800 billion a year
Do we make the deals? no.n "With China $505 billion trade deficit
And they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time
Whenever it gets a little bit tough devalue devalue and our companies cant compete with that
So Hillary says about Japan how dare he not not stay with our allies how dare he not do that?n
"I will never abandon our allies ever ever ever
Now how do you negotiate when youre telling somebody will never going to leave? We may have to leave.n
"Look Japan has problems because you have the maniac in North Korea making missiles
But I mean you know so well get it.n
"Now South Korea it is an economic behemoth
You cant buy television that is not made in South Korea except Sony which is made in Japan which has sort of lost its way
Whether it is LG or Samsung
I order thousands of television sets; you cant buy them in the United States
One of the pundits said they do make them
"And he showed me its a little company
What they do is all the parts come in for -- from all over the world; they put them together and they give you a television that doesnt work and nobody ever heard of it
n And then I put it into a luxury hotel and everybody complains right?n "So you cant say to people when youre negotiating -- because were talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars
You cant say to people -- you cant say to people when youre negotiating well never leave you.n
"Think of this were going to never leave you; we love you well never leave you
Could you pay more? No were not going to pay anymore
Youre not going to leave us
Why should we pay more?n
"So theres a chance well have to leave
And theres a chance that you know Japan will have to take over this monster and figure it out
"You know we have a treaty with Japan
And if the United States is attacked they dont have to do anything
But if Japan is attacked we have to go in there will our full force and might and who the hell knows whats going to happen rightn
"World War III who knows whats going to happen
But if were attacked they dont have to do anything
You tell me who makes these deals?n
"Its like Sergeant Bergdahl right? So we trade a dirty rotten traitor where five or maybe even six people were killed when he deserted and we knew that they were killed and we knew that he was a traitor
We trade for five of the greatest killers the greatest killers in the Middle East the five people that they wanted the most
So we get a traitor and they get five people that are right now most of them already back on the battlefields trying to kill everybody including us.n "No more folks
That is called the five for one president
Thats -- that is the same guy that made the deal for $400 million
The other guys couldnt leave the airport the hostages
And then all of a sudden they were able to leave.n
And then you watched him yesterday saying that can you believe it? This had nothing to do with that
No no just a coincidence -- no
You know she is unfit to serve as president for a lot of reasons
He has done so bad
He has been so incompetent
We have doubled our debt during his -- think of it
Over the years of our country -- over the years of our country he gets in and in eight years by the time his term is up we will have doubled our national debt.n Think of it
So we have to win this election
This is a very important election
I do not need to do this folks believe me
I could be elsewhere right now I love being with you.n "But I could be elsewhere
I could be -- I might be in Wisconsin just a different location
OK? But I felt I had to do it
I want to give back
I will get back give back Im going to give back
Im going to give back
n I want to give back
Because our country does not win anymore.n "Our country does not win anymore
And it is not going to win with crooked Hillary Clinton
Its not going to win
She does not know how to win
Our country is not going to win with her.n
"Were going to be worse than we are with Obama
I mean if you want four more years of what is going on ISIS all over the place ISIS expanding.n
And by the way our policeman are great great people
 n And we are not going to allow our policeman to be shot down anymore
No more.n "So November 8th you have a big election
I promise you this if I win were going to start winning again
We are going to win on trade were going to win with our military were going to take out ISIS we are going to win for our veterans who have been totally mistreated.n
We have a great plan for the veterans
Were are going to win for our veterans first time maybe ever.n
"We are going to win on trade deals
We are going to make the finest we are going to bring our jobs back
Were not going to make it easy for these companies to leave and fire everybody
It going to be very very expensive when they do it.n
"Believe me its going to be very very expensive
Theyre going to say you know what? Maybe well stay Wisconsin OK? Maybe we will stay
n "No its going to be very very hard
Were going to have strong borders were going to have the wall
Mexico is going to pay for the wall 100 percent 100 percent
n "We are going to get rid of Obamacare
Were going to get rid of Common Core were going to bring our education -- local

"Were going to appoint great Supreme Court justices
n "And folks were going to start winning again

"Youre going to be begging me Mr
President -- you will send your great quarterback right? He will come to the White House
Hell come to the White House and hell say Mr
President the people of Wisconsin they cant stand winning so much
n "Could you tone it down just a little bit? I will say I just cant do that
We are going to win more and more and more were going to win at every level.n
"But we are going to win
We are going to make America great again
Were going to make America safe again.n
Thank you very much everybody
