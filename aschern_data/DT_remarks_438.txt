Jon is such a great actor and such a great person
He is such a great person
And hes really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways
So I just want to thank Jon
And I hope he makes another movie very quickly because I love his movies
 In particular I wanted to thank our host Tony Perkins for his years of leadership
  And we know all about that
And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana where two weeks ago I spent some time and I saw some incredible incredible people
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! MR
"One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time Ive spent with the evangelical community
And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible I have to tell you
A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals
Im going to make it up to you too you watch
There are no more decent devoted or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States
Ive witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land gotten to know so many people
I saw it during my trip to Louisiana where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need
Franklin Graham is an example
He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana
And he didnt want anything for it
Its that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country which is in serious serious trouble
 "Yet our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith
All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in todays media environment.
TRUMP: It is right isnt it? 
Your values of love charity and faith built this nation
  So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you to a large extent
And Hillary Clinton you can forget about her
  "So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration our Christian heritage will be cherished protected defended like youve never seen before
And that includes religious liberty – remember remember
I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit Great Faith Ministries International
Stand up if youre member
That was a great – that was an amazing experience
 And the bishop what a great guy
In my remarks I spoke about how African American church – and this is all across the country – for centuries have been the conscience of our nation
Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history leading us all to a better future
This was such an amazing experience
This is the power of faith
Its the power to heal
Its the power to unite
Its the power to make all of us live better lives – all of us
 "Our nation today is divided
Nobody likes to say it but were living in a very very divided nation
It will be our faith in God and his teachings in each other that will lead us back to unity
 "Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together united in common purpose and in common values
So lets talk today about some of the things – and these are great things – that we can do together to create the American future for everybody not just a certain group of people but for everybody.
"The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back
The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits
If they want to talk about Christianity if they want to preach if they want to talk about politics theyre unable to do so
If they want to do it they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status.
All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings –   – on religious matters
And I will repeal the Johnson amendment –   – if I am elected your president I promise
And I must tell you from the heart this started a building of mine in Manhattan
I had 50 pastors in a big conference room
And we actually had 50 pastors two rabbis a couple of priests
And we were there for two hours
And at the end it was a love-fest
It was like a love-fest
"And I said to them – we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue – and I said to them Id love your support
And I know when I can get support
And I know they wanted to give me their total support 100 percent just like I had in the primaries
And I said I really would like your support
And they didnt really know what I was talking about
And I said whats going on here? They said well sir we cant do that because we would be violating the laws
And I said whats the punishment? Well we could lose our tax-exempt status which of course is a you know massive penalty.
I said tell me about this
When did it happen? 1954 or so
Lyndon Johnson was having problems – powerful guy
I actually as just own way – you have to gain respect for what he was able to do
Can you imagine that this man single-handedly – he was having problems with churches
And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time maybe for very good reason
And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status
"So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk
And I said so folks what youre telling me is those people walking way way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do because theyre allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty
And one of the pastors who I knew very well – and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just – and magnificent hearts much more importantly – they looked at me and they said thats actually right
They have more power than we do
Were not allowed to express.
"And thats what I said
We have to start thinking about this
And I thought about it
And then we had a large group of pastors again
I said I have thought about it
If I become president we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment
We are going to do that
And its not going to be hard
Its not going to be hard
 "When you – when you think from the standpoint of political you have more than men – lets say men are 50 percent women are 50 percent
Youre much more than 50 percent added together
And I actually believe thats one of the reasons why you havent seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship – like our polls have been going in the last four weeks a rocket ship right? 
I really believe that because youre great people
The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week theyve been stopped from talking and speaking by a law
And were going to get rid of that law and its going to get rid of – were going to get rid of it so fast.
"And Im so proud to say – honestly I dont want to take credit but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second
I am so proud – I was just telling this to Tony – to say that was my idea
I figure its the only way Im getting to heaven so this is going to be very – 
So were going to get rid of it and were going to let your great people speak and youre going to see something happen thats going to be very very good OK? So important.
"I hope – which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th
You cannot – you didnt vote four years ago
TRUMP: You did? Well you did
A few of you did
I look at the stats
But this time you really have – and this is your last chance
I mean well never have this opportunity again
So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up – your family and your friends and get out and vote OK? November 8th
And if you do were going to win by a lot
Thats not going to even be a close election
And if you dont could be a very unhappy November 8th.
"Were also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – 
– which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens
And the numbers are horrendous
Your premiums are going up by 50 60 70 percent
The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period – very very long
Its a disaster and everybody knows it
And its going to die of its own weight anyway but were going to get rid of it and were going to replace it with some great great alternatives – much better health care at a much lower price
 "Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America
Thats what shes aiming at
He didnt quite get there but he got this and you see how bad this has been.
One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice
And I cant possibly emphasize this enough
Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools
This education crisis afflicts all communities but none more so than the African-American community – none
The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50 60 70 years some cases over a hundred years – over a hundred years
Their policies and their politics and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton have produced only poverty joblessness and rising crime.
"When she was running for the Senate in New York State she said she was going to produce jobs jobs jobs in Upstate New York
Shes going to produce jobs big thing – jobs were going to bring back jobs
Weve lost tens of thousands of jobs
She never did a thing
It was all talk no action just like what shes doing right now is all talk no action
Shell talk and talk and nothing will happen
But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York
She won because of them and she produced absolutely nothing
Its today one of the worst one of the most depressing places in this country
So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs
That I can tell you
 I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time – the right to a safe community a great education and a secure job
  "And I say to African-American parents I say to Hispanic American parents – and I say it with great respect – our inner cities are a disaster – crime no jobs education is the worst in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad
I say with great respect what do you have to lose? It cant get any worse
It cant get any worse
You choose Donald Trump Im going to fix the problem
Youre going to have safety
Youre going to have good education
Were going to get jobs because were going to bring our jobs back
So many other places theyre taking our jobs
What Chinas doing to us is horrible
Were going to have jobs
What do you have to lose? Im going to fix this
Im going to fix it
 School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice
Competition – the schools the schools will get better and better and better
  And that means a private school a religious school a charter school or a magnet school
School choice also means that parents can home-school their children
Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally totally like a puppet by special interests
Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools leading to higher unemployment and more poverty
The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe nobody will believe
My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children –   – including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country every single one of them
  This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs
However – thats good right? 
 However because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs
  "If we do this that would mean $12000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America
What a difference this is going to make
The money will follow the student to the public private or religious school that is best for them and their family
In so many ways youre going to have choice.
My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city – anybody – anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program – and there will be a lot of them – to provide school choice to every child in that community
In Baltimore for instance that would mean more than $15000 in funds available per student
"As your president I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice youve ever seen
This means a lot to me because I know it can turn things around
Again the education cant get worse
Commo Core – were going to end it
"I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures
The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again and Im going to bring back jobs and Im going to bring back the great education
Dont be surprised – remember this November 8th – dont be surprised because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago
You see whats going on? 
 "Theyre starting – people are starting to hear about this
And again cant get any worse
Its going to get a lot better
But only if I do it
The Democrats they have – what theyve done is incredible
And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same – rigid
Remember a hundred years 70 years 50 – its not going to change
"Now lets talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come the United States Supreme Court
 Earlier this year we lost the great justice Antonin Scalia
The next president will not only have to fill this seat but as many as four others
It could even be – I mean we could end up with a total of five judges by one president
And you pick the wrong people you have a country that is no longer your country
It will be a disaster
"One of the most important issues frankly – other than maybe defense because were going to build up our military its so depleted
Were going to take care of our vets
Were going to protect your Second Amendment so many things
But one of the most important – some people think its actually the most important – is the filling of the seats United States Supreme Court
You see whats happening right now? Essentially its four and four
And you see what – how bad it is
Were going to pick great judges
Ive already put a list of 11 Federalist Society highly recommended got uniform great reviews on these 11 people
And we are going to put truly great people
Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what were looking for OK? 
 "This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic frankly
Thats whats going to happen
I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution to protect your religious liberty and apply the law as written
We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans
Were not going to have that
Ive made public a list of judges as I said that will guide my selection process
Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list
And we brought it up.
You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well
Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public
Clintons judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care the American economy and Americans religious liberty – not to mention your Second Amendment which is on very thin ice right now as you know because of the fact that were at four-and-four
If they even pick one judge whos wrong you can probably – as you know it – you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye
And we dont want to see that.
"Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security
Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test – its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state
Its just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state
Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power
They were dying three years ago
The sanctions were choking them
But Obama didnt support people that would have taken over and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support.
"But you look at whats happened to Iran in such a short period of time
But remember the ransom payments
Remember it was $400 million two weeks ago
But then they made a mistake
Remember they said they paid cash because they couldnt open a bank account
There was no way of sending it into a checking account
All lies just like Obamacare was a big lie remember? You can use your plan
You can use your doctors – 27 times right? Twenty-seven times
You can use your doctors use your plan; turned out to be a lie
Its all a big lie
Its a rigged system and its a lie.
"And Ill tell you what
The 400 million (dollars) for those that havent been reading the papers over the last two days turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – cash
And I actually said – they said oh that moneys going to be used for terror
I said no they dont need it for terror
Theyve got 150 billion (dollars)
Thats in addition to the $150 billion that were giving back
I said they dont need it
This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts
Theyre not going to use it for terror
They have plenty of money for terror.
"Think of it – $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – massive big vats of cash
You saw them – cartons
I never saw anything like it
Ive seen a lot of cash
Hey never saw anything like this – $1.7 billion (dollars)
Can you imagine these guys? Planes get – they stop
Remember they wouldnt give back the hostages
They waited there for hours and hours
And Obama kept saying no no this has nothing to do – even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in not to take them back because they were waiting for something
It was this – just another lie.
"But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai yai yai
They wont be thinking it for long
  "At the same time ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross
ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East
We cannot let this evil continue – can t let it
 ISIS must be destroyed – have to; have no choice
"To defeat ISIS we must use military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare
Its a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago – different world.
We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism –  
– words that our president wont use and words that Hillary Clinton wont use
Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism.
"By the way President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more
But its almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria
They take others but they dont take Christians – very very very rare.
"So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region
We want to take care of people
But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue and we have to stop this
This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country
This could be the all-time great Trojan horse
You ever notice on the – you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones
And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them
And some of them have things far worse than that – scenes far worse than that
"So it was the failed policies you have to remember of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place
If they did the right thing you wouldnt be talking about ISIS right now
Now she wants to get rid of – oh were going to get rid of them
You know she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground
Now even if you dont want boots on the ground you dont want to say it
Dont say it! Now theyre saying oh I hope she wins
Oh boy would they dream of having her as president
– they dream about it every night having Hillary Clinton
But even if you believe – and I can understand that
No boots on the ground I can understand
You dont say it! Let them think theyre going to go through hell
 "Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur can you imagine the great General George Patton or one of our great generals that we have today – General Flynn whos here someplace – 
– I love General Flynn – but can you imagine these people saying – I mean theyre basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground
If you dont want that I fully understand
Dont say it! Dont say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying were going to fight the enemy and were going to move our troops in in about a month were going to hit from behind? 
Were going to hit them from the front then – and everything they say turns out to be true? You know I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room but maybe we shouldnt be so honest when it comes to military strategy
Hope I didnt lose your vote for saying that
 "Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq Syria and Libya
The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy
Shes trigger-happy and yet she says no boots which is sort of – probably will be boots you know
Probably will turn out to be another disaster
He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death
Shes just too quick to intervene invade or to push for regime change with people we dont even know who they are
And they take over and theyre far worse
This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS.
"My administration on the other hand will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism
And by the way that includes Russia
If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS that is just fine as far as Im concerned
Its a very imperfect world and you cant always choose your friends
"But you can never fail to recognize your enemies
We have some real enemies
Unfortunately for our country our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clintons emails
These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena
Whats that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never ever see them
She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them and many were destroyed with a hammer
 Did anybody ever hit a hammer – you know maybe two or three people but they were just released from prison those two people
  Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer – the old-fashioned way I guess
  The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum – did anybody see that?   How did I do?  
Well we have a big debate coming up
Who knows whats going to happen there? But I will say every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief
We had – the polls came out after that event and we won big league
Now we have a debate coming up
I dont imagine any of you going to be watching the debate right? 
 "AUDIENCE MEMBER: Dont take her bait
TRUMP: I wont; I promise
Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly
Thats why she did so poorly
She was – honestly I shouldnt be saying this – she was terrible
 She keeps talking about the emails
Every time she talks about them she talks about them differently
It seems each week true she has like a different answer
But there can be no answer when she deletes 33000 emails bleaches them so they can never be recovered – an unheard-of practice – hammers them into total silence
I always say getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career
 So her answers were bad
And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest
And you know she was blaming Matt Lauer
I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job
I mean his questions to me were very tough
  But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly you should be in prison for what you did –   – to me that was the tough one
  That was the tough – hey that was a tough question
  It was sort of a question in the form of a statement right?   Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president for many reasons
Shes unfit for many reasons the biggest of which is her judgement
Its time to restore honestly and integrity to our government
And one more issue finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy and helping those in need
There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians
  And all of us through – and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty
Going to do it with a lot of other people going to help
As you president I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country – millions of new jobs
Weve lost our jobs like were a bunch of babies
Theyve gone to other countries
Theyve gone to many other countries
Chinas taking massive advantage of us
Its all so easy believe me
That includes we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses
  It includes very importantly the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations
  It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy which is under siege
I will also renegotiate NAFTA
And if they dont want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs we will terminate NAFTA believe me
Well stand up to China and were going to fight for every last job
Its going to be America first and its going to be the American worker first
 Crucially I will also fight for the American family and American family values
The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda
Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family Phyllis Schlafly
Great woman really great woman
  We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones
I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St
  "Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America
She understood that to be truly united as a country we cant simply turn to government or to politicians
The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God
"And by the way Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago when it wasnt necessarily – 
– something that was so easy to do
She endorsed me and that was not the thing to do at the time
People said Trump? She said hes going to win you dont understand
He knows how to win
They said Phyllis not going to be Trump
And we went boom boom boom
But I will tell you Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasnt necessarily the thing to do even the popular thing to do and I will never forget that
That had a huge impact
She was a great great powerful woman with a tremendous heart
And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow because you really – thats a celebration
She was 92 years old
 "We are all equal and we all come from the same Creator
If we remember that simple fact then our future is truly limitless
There is nothing we as Americans cant do.
Theres a biblical verse that I have often read and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what were trying to achieve right now for our country
Its from 1 John Chapter 4: "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another God lives in us and His love is made complete in us.
  Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one flag
Its time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country.
"This is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017 we will be one American nation
Its time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future
Together we will make America believe again we will make America united again and we will make America great again
Thank you very much and God bless you
