Shirley Skinner has seen a lot
Born in 1915—five years before most women could legally vote in America—Shirley has lived through the Great Depression two world wars the Civil Rights Movement and the moon landing
"In that time shes seen incredible progress in America
And today Shirley is rooting for something she never thought shed live to see: the first woman president of the United States.
   RMS Mauretania  Shirley was only 5 years old when most women got the right the vote but she remembers the reactions
"People would say that it was going to be terrible that the country was going to go to the devil
Shes right: One of the more popular arguments against allowing women to vote was in the words of one anti-suffrage group "80 percent of the women eligible to vote are married and can only double or annul their husbands votes.
  But Shirley also remembers her mother coyly telling critics of the 19th Amendment "Well see.
"Shirley she set out to build her own life on her own terms—but at that time it didnt come easily.
  She remembers how hard it was for women to accomplish the simplest things: When she tried to get a mortgage on her own the bank told her "Well that wont do.
When she tried to buy a car they asked her if it was for her husband
And when she went to buy a farm the seller all but laughed in her face
But attitudes like that only made Shirley work harder
Eventually she got her own car—a Ford
"We were always Ford people
And though it raised eyebrows Shirley even taught herself how to drive—a skill that would prove useful as the men in her hometown shipped off to fight in World War II
While the war raged on Shirley became a chauffeur on Long Island joining the growing movement of women who got "war jobs
in order to keep the country moving
And sure enough Shirley got her farm too
The more she shrugged off peoples narrow attitudes about women the easier it became to forge ahead
In 1936 Shirley cast her first vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt—and shes been voting the progressive ticket ever since
"Ive always been a Democrat
"And as for todays Republicans?
"Well some of the men arent very good
Shirley says with all the diplomacy she can muster
"For Shirley who lived through the evolution of womens rights in America having a woman hold the highest office in this country is more than symbolic
Its real tangible evidence of how far women have come over the last century.
"Shirley is quick to point out that its not just about electing any woman.
Shes always thought highly of Hillary Clinton
"She was always doing something
Shes a fan of Hillarys policies too—particularly the ones that will affect seniors like protecting and expanding Social Security and Medicaid
"Shirley is firmly committed to her plans to vote in this election
And in the meantime shes letting everyone know who shes voting for and why—and working tirelessly to turn supporters out for Hillary Clinton.
"Because if theres one thing Shirley has learned over a lifetime of progress its that theres only one way to shatter a glass ceiling: with hard work one crack at a time.
