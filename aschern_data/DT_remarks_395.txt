What great people.n "Were going to bring back our jobs to Pennsylvania
Were going to bring back our jobs to the United States
n "Going to bring back our jobs folks
Ive looked at the numbers and I see whats happening in Pennsylvania
I see whats happening all over our country.n
"You look at New York state you look at New England you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to all over its the same
Manufacturing way down jobs way down
You go to other countries theyre taking our companies theyre taking our jobs.n
"People are right now working harder than theyve ever worked
Eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages 18 years think of it
Eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room and thank you for being here you know its 93 degrees out
n "And they still have a lot of people trying to get in I dont know if they can get them in
Should we let them in? Just let them in
n "But 18 years ago people were making more money in real wages than they make today
And today theyre working two jobs some people are working three jobs
So theyre older and theyre working harder and theyre making less money all right? A friend of mine Ive been telling this story over the last month because its better than going to Wharton or better than going to Harvard and asking them to do a study because you learn it in three minutes.n
"But let me just tell you
Right now Mexico and other countries are building facilities plants the likes of which youve never seen
Were going to build the wall dont worry were going to build the wall were going to build it were going to build it
n "But a friend of mine and actually a supporter big supporter great guy
He builds plants thats what he does he builds plants
He doesnt want to build apartments he doesnt want to build office buildings he wants to build plants
And hes just about the biggest there is
And I said how are things going? He said very well how are you doing in the U.S.? Not good
How are you doing in Mexico?n
"He said Donald do you want to see its the eighth wonder of the world
They are building plants the likes of which Ive never seen
Hes building some of the greatest plants big—you look at Ford moving vast operations to Mexico
You look at—look at take a look
By the way millions of jobs thousands of companies over the years theyve left us
And we have a few things
We have unemployment we have empty plants I saw up in New York state I saw it in Pennsylvania you were great to meet you voted a big victory for Donald Trump thank you
n "That was a big victory
I mean I assumed I was going—if I dont win Pennsylvania—and by the way I was talking to our great Congressman and where is he? Hes here some place where is he? 
n "He loves the people and I have to say of all of Pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well
But just talking back to a few of my friends that live here we have a few of the friends and we see whats happened with General Electric where theyre cutting way back
And you know why theyre cutting back its one reason
Because we dont take care of our miners and were not producing coal.n
"And they dont need to make those big big beautiful you could call them locomotives I guess right? Whatever the hell they are theyre big and theyre powerful and they dont need them like they used to because we dont make our government work for us
Theyre not working for us
Theyre working for others theyre not working for us
So when General Electric goes out and you see the numbers I see the numbers and its about coal so I just left parts of Virginia and West Virginia and the coal industrys decimated.n
"The miners are out of work theyre totally out of work
I mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon
And were talking clean coal were talking clean coal.n
"So I was with the miners we have such tremendous support West Virginia the mining parts of Virginia
All over Ohio because Hillary Clinton made the statement not so long ago
A number of months she said were going to put the mines and miners out of business
All right? Going to put the mines and the miners – so 
n "So were not going to let that happen
Were not going to let that happen and were not going to let it happen in Pennsylvania because you know what? A lot of your miners have already lost their jobs but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines
Like as an example General Electric
And what were going to do folks is going to be so special
Were going to bring it back
Were going to bring back our jobs were going to bring back our companies
n "When a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think theyre going to make their product and because our politicians are weak stupid taken care of by lobbyists special interests—theyre taken care of by lobbyists theyre taken care of by donors and special interests
Thats what—you know a friend of mine—very smart guy—said—I cant believe it
Were talking about a deal that took place about a month ago.n
"He said I cant believe they could have gotten that through
I said Why cant you believe it? Well its so bad for the country
I said Yeah but its good for the politician because theyre taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests.n
"So even though you say we want as an example General Electric to produce more if they dont want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked Hillary Clinton doesnt want that to happen even though its great for Erie even though its great you even though its great for the state of Pennsylvania then its not going to happen folks
Its not going to happen.n
"And by the way—and I have to tell you this
So when they think theyre going to take our companies are rip them out of—as an example—this area or this state or any other state and go to Mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you and youre going to lose your jobs or youre going to now get two part- time jobs that dont add up to half of what you used to make
That stuff isnt happening anymore
Theyre going to build that plant
Now if I were here five years ago and if President Obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the United States—thats my title secretary of keeping business in the United States
n "I mean I like the sound of secretary of defense better
Oh and by the way were going to build our military
Were going to be very strong
And were going to take care of our vets
Were going to take care of our vets believe me
n "But I like the sound—I like the sound of secretary of Defense
I like the sound of secretary of the Treasury
I like the sound of secretary of State
But Ill tell you would I be good at keeping jobs over here
n "Ill tell you this
I just have to say the Bernie Sanders protesters were much much stronger
They had much more passion I have to say
You know whats interesting? If I could speak to them for like five minutes—we want a strong military we want to take care of our people we want good education we want good housing we want good healthcare
What do we want? Were all in for the same thing
So Ill be your secretary of keeping companies in the United States right? So I would go to a company like Carrier Air Conditioner which decided to leave Indianapolis Indiana and I would say heres the story.n
"We think its wonderful that youre negotiating with Mexico
Im sure youre going to have a wonderful plant but heres whats going to happen
If you build that plant and you fire all of these people 1400 people who were so great to me.n
"Indiana I won that in a landslide
Actually the timing was good
I won it in a landslide because I know what to do
Hillary doesnt know what to do
Did you see her yesterday? She has no clue about what were talking about
Folks she has no clue
She doesnt know anything about it and by the way if she did she couldnt do it anyway because her donors dont want to do it
I would go to them and say just to keep them
And I wouldnt even care that much
Ready? Id say heres the story.n
"If you leave in this case Indianapolis youre going to go to Mexico youre going to make your air conditioning units
Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very very strong border were going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit
Thirty five percent the cost of that unit
We hope you enjoy your new plant
Very hot weather out there very hot
We hope you enjoy your new plant but 35 percent is coming to us
Now heres whats going to happen if they havent moved yet
A lot of them have moved.n
"Weve lost thousands and thousands of companies weve lost millions of jobs - too late
I should have been there 10 years ago
Nobody would have left because you need the right messenger you know Im your messenger in terms of this movement.n
"But you need the right person saying it
So heres whats going to happen
Normally theyd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and theyd have one of their lobbyists call up and theyd say Hillary Im sorry you cant do that they gave you $2 million for your campaign
OK I wont do that.n
"With me Im putting my money up folks
Im putting my money up
Were raising money for Reince and for the RNC but thats for a lot of other reasons
We are putting - Im putting a lot of money up
I financed my - I funded not financed I wish I financed right? I funded but I funded my primaries and I spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures
So heres a story - wouldnt that be nice?n
"I spent less and won in a landslide
Other people spent much much more
Three four five times more and they came in seventh
Who the hell do you want to have as your president right? Right? Right? Oh boy and then they dont like me - couple of them most of them have really supported us but some of them just cant get over it
You know what I say to them? Get over it
"You signed a pledge I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins - you know the funny thing all those pledges you know they were signed for different - they were signed so that I would sign it
And I would have honored it I will say
Even if I wasnt fond or didnt like - I would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing
So we are going to take these companies that havent left - now Im looking at your numbers folks youre not doing too well.n
"Youre not doing too well here
Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since - you know thats massive since NAFTA
NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and I believe its the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world.n
"Its one of the most one-sided documents that Ive ever seen
And it allowed Mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense
And did you see where say Im going to renegotiate NAFTA Im going to—TPP disaster
"And Hillary was in favor of TPP
She said its the gold standard
Thank you for reminding me
It is going to be—I dont think you can be worse than NAFTA honestly
But its going to be as bad as NAFTA
So TPP she said it is the gold standard
Shes reading it from a teleprompter
It is the gold standard—oh boy
Our country is in trouble
Our country is in trouble
Our country is in trouble.n
"So she said its the gold standard
But when she heard me make a speech as I understand it
And she heard me talking very negatively about it
As an example they dont talk devaluation which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the United States including China
Number one thing is not mentioned.n
By the way I believe trade
I believe in trade deals
One country at a time
You got to see the lines
And if they dont do well.n
"If they dont behave themselves if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place very simple we write them a notice like we do in business
We serve them with a 30 day notice
n And by the way you just saw how great are our police right?  n "Law and order
We need law and order
We need law and order and we will have law and order
Our police our firemen - but our police do a fantastic job
They are not recognized for the great job they do
If they have 500000 incidents all positively beautifully handled one bad thing happens that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and its a disgrace
"So we should be very thankful for the job they do
So Pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business
Right now were sitting here were talking - oh heres another one
n "And your mother is voting for trump! Shes voting for Trump
"By the way just to interject - so I was told this whole area is Democratic meaning Democrat
And I was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said I cant believe that you have 10000 people you have people outside trying to get in.n
"They said the came up to me this is - happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know is a good guy—came up to me and said Ive never seen anything like it
Is that a correct statement? Said you are going to win Erie in a and the surrounding area - youre going to win in a landslide
n "Because people are tired of lies theyre tired of losing their jobs theyre tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places
Theyre tired of China coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business so we have to go to China to get our steel which is happening very quickly.n
"And thats why the steel workers are with me thats why the miners are with me thats why the working people electricians the plumbers the sheetrockers the concrete guys and gals theyre all - theyre with us.n
"And I grew up you know they say you know youre really rich how come you sort of relate to these people? Well my father built houses and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians I got to know all these people I got to know the plumbers the steamfitters—I got to know them all.n
"And I liked them better than the rich people that I know
I know a lot of rich people
"So anyway—and we are going to put people back to work
And its going to go quickly
By the way its going to go quickly.n
"But look at this OK
So Erie has lost one in three manufacturing jobs
You know that all I—you do—I flew over youre looking at the plants plants that 25 years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago some two years ago were vibrant.n
"But no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half down to a quarter down to a tenth and then ultimately they closed but you see them
The rain the sleet the snow the wind
These are great buildings that are falling apart
Dont feel bad all over the country
Upstate New York is a disaster which Hillary Clinton said that she was going to fix.n
"OK so the Washington Post is extraordinarily dishonest and thats fine
But they wrote a story I couldnt believe I saw this story they talked about Hillary Clinton
It was a headline Hillary Clinton and when she ran for the United States Senator from New York she said to the people in upstate New York which was starting to really have problems because of her husbands bill NAFTA.n
"And companies were leaving tremendous unemployment tremendous problems making nothing and she said I will turn it around I will create 200000 jobs were going to do a great job
Guess what? She got elected she did nothing
And the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out
upstate New York is right now worse than anything you have in the state of Pennsylvania she did nothing.n
And I watched her yesterday which was hard to do because she is boring OK?  n "I watched her yesterday talking about—you know whats funny? I said Im going to renegotiate NAFTA and they said what happens if you cant make a deal I said were going to terminate were getting out
n "So Ive been saying that and Ive been saying were going to renegotiate different trade deals and were going to make great trade deals and all this and shes never said that
All of a sudden two days ago I will renegotiate trade deals
Shes not going to do it folks
Shes going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200000 jobs in upstate New York.n
"It turned out to be a total fantasy and I have to tell you I respect the Washington Post for writing one bad story
Because you what theyre doing? And Reince was alluding to it a little bit the only way she gets elected is if they dont report on her
They have me on so much television
Theres CNN you talk about dishonesty its called the Clinton—wait—its called the Clinton News Network CNN
Now think of it Clinton is
n "Shes hardly ever on
So yesterday they have yesterday a scandal with the emails another one
Im not talking about the 33000 emails that she deleted or got rid of
Can you imagine what was on those emails? Can you imagine? I love that
Can you imagine what was on those emails 33000 emails were deleted
And she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga.n
"I give two to yoga I give five to the wedding
Ill tell you the lies the deception
Were running like they run right now a third world country folks OK? You saw what happened its running like a third world country were being talked about all over the world nobody can believe it.n
In fact when they were going over the charges against Hillary Clinton one after another after another after another however and yet other people their lives have been destroyed for doing much less all right?n "Their lives have been destroyed
So now they have a big scandal in New York
Its in the New York papers but very little
Pay right? Pay for play
And its horrifying its horrifying
Our government is for sale
Our government is for sale by a crooked person
And what theyre doing is theyre trying to not talk about her
You go to CNN as an example
Story after story about Trump
"And yesterday it was announced that people are tired of negative—the hit jobs and CNNs starting to do very poorly
And I have to say Fox has been treating us fairly
But CNN has been catastrophic
"But somebody was explaining to me their theory
If they dont report on her people arent going to know how bad she is
Look at her news conference
She hasnt had a news conference in like 260 days
That last one wasnt a news conference
That was a few of her friends
They asked her a question
What did she say about the circuit right? Let me tell you if I ever said that short- circuited if I ever said I short-circuited it would be headlines all over the world
They would call for the death penalty
n Can you imagine if I said that I short-circuited? I mean I stand up here for months in front of massive crowds she gets 300 people going to her events
She gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep
 n "And then she wakes and she goes again
And Im telling you—and nobody does anything about it
Now me I stand up here—Im not looking at notes
n But—but—remember—but—and if I make one mistake  
say he mention something wrong
He got a wrong date
Its like headlines all over
She can say she short-circuited up here
I dont want a president who short-circuits
Is that OK? I dont want it
I dont want a president who short-circuits
n "Weve got to deal with ISIS
Weve got to deal with China
Weve got to deal with lots of people
But I dont want somebody that short-circuits
So let me just tell you—let me just tell you.n
"Over the last little while—you know every time its always a big deal
When I said that Obama—and of course Im being sarcastic
And they know that because after I said that I said hes the MVP hes going to collect his MVP award
So I said Obama is the founder of ISIS
 n "And these dishonest media people—theyre the most dishonest people
They said oh did he mean that? Didnt he mean that? And after that Id say a lot—in fact they like him so much because hes been so weak and so bad
I mean he let this happen
Theyre now in 28 countries
"So I said the founder of—obviously Im being sarcastic
Then—then—but not that sarcastic to be honest with you
n "And they all said he should not say that
They should call him an enabler
I said that doesnt sound the same
People are going to say whats—these people are the worst
But listen so I said the founder of ISIS
And in fact very soon hes going over to pick up his most valuable player award
Did I say that? I say it all the time
TRUMP: So they knew I was being sarcastic
Did I really mean that? How could I say that? These people are the lowest form of life
n They are the lowest form of humanity
They have about 25 percent that are pretty good actually
But most of them.n "OK
So Erie has lost a lot
Right? You know that right? Hang in dont leave
I promise we can fix it so fast
We will stop these countries from taking our jobs
We will stop these countries from taking our companies
"Our jobs will come back
Now I came up with a great plan
Im lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay so I dont even have to make the call
The corporate inversions - you know we have companies that have they say two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp - they cant get their money back
Everybody agrees that we should do it
Republicans Democrats everybody agrees.n "Whats the - look why do we not want them to bring money back? You know why? Because we dont have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say lets bring this money back in so we can work it in this country right?n
So were going to bring that money back in were going to lower taxes were going to keep our companies - and if our companies want to leave theyre going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in.n
"OK? Thats whats going to happen
trade deficit with TPP participating nations has already cost Pennsylvania 68000 jobs folks
"Were not going to be stupid people any more were going to be the really really smart people
Its going to be America first
n "So the destruction of manufacturing in Pennsylvania was caused by Hillary Clintons and her husbands disastrous trade policies.n
"I mean you take a look at what shes done
At the bidding of her corporate funders Hillary Clinton has backed every job-killing trade deal for decades
She has received so much money she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her.n
"Yesterday - you see 1.3 trillion in tax increases
Were the highest taxed nation in the land essentially
Were the highest taxed nation in the world
"And of the industrialized nations were far and away the highest taxed nation
And shes proposing a massive tax increase
Folks we cant do it
Its going to make our country non-competitive - its already non-competitive.n
"Its going to make our country non-competitive and were not going to do it
Im proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class for business and businesses are going to pour in - not since Ronald Reagan has anything like this been proposed.n
"Businesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high theyre going to stay
I might not even have to make those calls
Now if I do I will meaning my people will
Ill do some I love doing it
I would love telling some guy youre not moving
President sir we would like to move to Mexico
Youre not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax
You say Well in that case Im not moving Im not moving
In that case Im not moving
"So your coal industry your steel industry which has been ravaged your General Electrics of the world which have been ravaged just ravaged were going to end it and Ill tell you why
Over the years Ive watched
For years for 10 years for 12 years for 15 years beyond Obama and Ive watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving - companies from leaving our states
You need strength is right.n
Remember they give the low-interest loans? Heres a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania heres a zero-interest loan you dont have to pay heres a this heres tax abatement of any kind you want well help your - it doesnt work folks thats not what they need
They want to go out they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution not have any consequences.n "So all of thats over and I think you understand it and Hillary cant do it
Number one she cant do it because the mentality isnt there
"You know she said fairly recently I dont like Donald Trumps tone
And I said here we have a country thats being taken advantage of by every country in the world
Our businesses are being taken
"Here we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says I dont like Donald Trumps tone
n "Folks we better get smart folks
Hey look lets see what happens
n "We better get smart
And if were not smart and were not tough were not going to have a country left
And one of the things I have to talk to you about before I leave is our borders
Illegal immigrants are pouring into our country
In fact I brought something for you people
I brought—I brought—I had to do this
I didnt want to depress you
"Nearly one in three manufacturing jobs in Erie PA—Erie PA sound familiar—have been lost since Clinton allowed a certain deal with China to happen
Now look at this—look at this chart
This is 2001 not long ago
I hope youre doing well
OK? I hope youre doing well
I dont want to hurt them
I hope youre doing well.n
"But you know what? You cant do well
When you have a government that is so stupid that is so—that is so incompetent you cant do it
This is what were talking about
Syrian refugees—we have no idea who they are where theyre coming from no paperwork
You saw what happened in San Bernardino
You saw what happened—frankly take a look at all over the world
Take a look at whats happening.n
"If we dont get smart and we dont get smart fast—Barack Obama is allowing Syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands
Now I have as big a heart as anybody in this room and I want to build safe zones and I want by the way the Gulf states to pay for it because theyve got plenty of money and theyre not doing much
Well supervise it right? Well supervise it.n
"But theyre going to pay for it because were protecting these people
If it werent for the United States those countries wouldnt even exist
The power we have is so enormous but we have people that dont know what theyre doing
We have an incompetent president
We have people that dont know what theyre doing.n
Syrian refugees admitted to the United States on a monthly basis
n "Now in all fairness we want to help people
San Bernardino they walk in
Paris the best the toughest gun laws in the world Paris France
They wound so gravely hundreds of people.n
"Now let me just tell you because well—were on the Second Amendment right Second Amendment
If we had in San Bernardino—if we had in San Bernardino or in Orlando or someplace somebody in that room like this guy right here right or that guy with the blue make America great again hat on or the one with the red make America—or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair
I wish I had hair that looked like that
n "But if we had somebody and they happened to have a gun San Bernardino they see him come in—first of all if they knew there was a gun where the bullets would be flying in the other direction they probably wouldnt have got 
in OK? But lets assume they did.n
The carnage would not have been what the carnage was
We have to protect our Second Amendment
Hillary Clinton wants to kill our second amendment
 n She wants to kill it
 n "So heres our chart
And I was thinking about doing a—I bring—every once in a—like one in ten I do it you know a lot of these
We have such a movement going on
Who likes the snake? Do you know the snake? Do you like it? Who likes the snake? Here we are with this
We know bad things are going to happen
We know as we allow more and more people to come in from these terror areas bad things are going to happen.n
"Has anybody heard the snake? Not that many? Should I do it again? So think of this folks think of this think of it
This is what is going on in our country with our borders
And by the way were going to have a strong border were going to have a wall its going to be a powerful wall that Mexicos going to pay for the wall
n "And we have no choice and we have no choice
This is now a situation where this was written by Al Wilson many years ago and I read it and I said you know that really pertains to whats happening to the United States and it has to do with being fooled it has to do with a lot of different things but when youre listening to this think of our border think of the people that were letting in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton you saw those numbers right? With the chart its through the roof.n
"Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country
How stupid are we? So are you ready you ready you like it you sure? On her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew
Oh well she cried Ill take you in and Ill take care of you.n
"Take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake
She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk
Then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk
Now she hurried home from work that night
As soon as she arrived she found that pretty snake shed taken in had been revived
Take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake.n
"Take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake
Now she clutched him to her bosom
Youre so beautiful she cried
But if I hadnt brought you in by now you certainly would have died
Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight
But instead of saying thank you that snake gave her a vicious bite
Take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake.n
"Take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake
I saved you I saved you I saved you cried that woman
And youve bit me heavens why
You know your bite is poisonous and now Im going to die
Oh shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin
You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in
n "Get ready folks get ready
Were led by stupid people
Were led by leaders and you know honestly I didnt need this
I had a nice life built a great company—a great company some of the great real estate assets of the world
I may never see them
You know if I win I may never see them again and I love them—all over the world.n
But you know what? This is so important
And I watched what was happening with the Iran deal and I watched what was happening with jobs and I watched what was happening with trade where China makes $500 billion in trade deficits with us.n "I look and I saw
Take a look at Mexico
You know the politicians say youll never ever be able to get Mexico to allow you to build a wall
Now they dont say that anymore
Now they say they wont put the money up to build a wall
Mexico—our trade deficit is massive massive
They make a fortune off the stupidity of the United Stated.n
Mexico will 100 percent—you hear—100 percent pay for the wall 100 percent
 n "OK? One hundred percent
But the story of the snake is whats happening to our country
Many of these people hate us
Many of these people dont have good thoughts
And you see what one person can do—one sick wacko can do in Orlando
And then you see his father sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face—with a big fat smile on his face right?n
"And he was wearing a red hat and I said I hope thats not one of my hats
I said I hope it doesnt say make America great again
"So heres the story folks
We have to win—we have to win Pennsylvania so important
n "Hillary Clinton is run by people that do this very professionally
They keep her out of the spotlight
She doesnt talk to reporters—very rarely
She doesnt do press conferences
She doesnt expose whatevers going on up here
She doesnt expose her mind to questions
And what they want to do is they want to try and fake it through.n
We need a strong temperament
We need a strong tone
At the same time—at the same time let me tell you—at the same time we need real big beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare
Obamacares going to be repealed and replaced.n
"Its going to repay—did you see—did you see whats happening with Obamacare? Did you see where the numbers are going up 30 40 and 50 percent? Wait until you see what happens on November 1st
Now on November 1st theyre trying to delay it.n
"But youre going to get increases the likes of which probably no country nobody has ever seen
OK? Anybody in the history of healthcare—in Texas through going through Blue Cross Blue Shield they just had almost a 50 percent increase in their premiums.n
"And the deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by one of those General Electric locomotives and you live for like a long time prior to death youll never ever be able to use your healthcare—the healthcare
Because heres whats happened—heres whats happened
The deductible is so high you never get to use it.n
"So youre spending money your deductibles raises by 17 18 19 percent
But now its going to go really bad really bad
Its going to die of its own volition but we have to kill it first
Its killing our country its killing our jobs—its killing our jobs.n
"So heres the story folks—folks
We have to win Pennsylvania
We have to beat this professional group of people that are running her for her own—for their own purposes
We have to win Pennsylvania
We win Pennsylvania were going to win it
You know were up in Florida
Were doing well in Ohio
And Im hearing were doing well here
We have to win the state of Pennsylvania
I went to school here
My kids went to school here
Were going to win Pennsylvania.n
"If we win Pennsylvania Ill tell you what
We are very much on our way
You know the Republicans do have a tougher path just so you—not my fault
"For the presidency its just a tougher winding road
But if win Pennsylvania we win Florida where were doing really well I think we can win Ohio itll be over
n "So on November 8th you have to get out and vote or do some balloting and I dont care—look heres the story
If youre not feeling well if youre so sick if you go to your doctor and he goes Im sorry sir but youve only got a few weeks left
And he gives you the ultimate word not looking good
You havent got long left
I dont care and nobody else in this room cares
You have to on November 8th get out of bed and get out and vote right? Get out and vote
n "Now in a lot of cases you can do your early ballots too
All Im telling you though—look folks
Im just saying your jobs have been taken
Your military and all of the other things were going to save your Second Amendment which is protection were going to get of Common Core youre going to bring your education locally
n "All things—Im going to repeal and replace Obamacare
Were going to take care of our vets
But heres the story folks
For you people in particular because you have been devastated.n
Who did that? Who said that? Thank you.n By the way and I have to just stop for a second
Look Supreme Court Justice Scalia great
Was supposed to live for a long time
So you have already an empty
This next president could have the most Supreme Court nominations of any president
Could take more justices than—it could be up to five
Probably going to be three could be four could be five
OK?n "If Hillary Clinton gets to put hard-leaning left judges on the Supreme Court number one your Second Amendment will be gone
Our country will never ever be the same
We will have problems like weve never had before and you wont have—you will have a whole different deal going which we dont want believe me.n
If for no other reason I am going to put—and you know Ive picked through Federalist society—we picked 11 Supreme Court justices
Were going to add probably four more all vetted through Federalists through Heritage highly—I actually got very good marks
Were going to pick these people or people very like that.n
"So heres the story heres the story
You ready? We dont win anymore you people dont win thats for sure
You just have to look at the statistics for jobs
Were going to start winning again
Were going to win so much that youre going to get sick and tired of winning.n
"Youre going to say Mr
President—youre going to send the congressman to see me in Washington
Hes going to say Mr
President we have to do something
The people of Pennsylvania and in particular our friends in Erie theyre sick and tired of winning
They cant stand winning so much
President we just dont want to win that much
We really want to give other nations like it used to be where its good for them and bad for us at least a little bit.n
"And Im going to say—Im going to say Mr
Congressman I dont think you know your people very well they want to win
And we want to win
And you want to win
And were going to win
Were going to win so much
Were going to win with our military were going to knock the hell out of ISIS
n "Were going to win for our vets
Were going to take of our vets
Were going to win at the border were going to build a wall were going to have Mexico pay believe me 100 percent
Were going to win with education
Were going to win for our Second Amendment
Were going to win on all of the things we discussed
Were going to win again and youre going to be proud of your country again.n
"Were not going to be the people that are laughed at all over the world for not knowing what were doing for allowing others to come in and just strip us of what we have
n We are going to win
We are going to be America first
 n "We are going to make America great again
And its going to happen quickly
n Thank you everybody thank you
