This caucus could come down to a razor-thin margin of victory so the most important thing you can do today is to jump on the phone and remind some Iowans to get out and caucus
"If youve never made calls before dont worry—this is the perfect time to start
Well provide you with a script answers to any questions you might have and even a live online training every hour on the hour starting at 10 a.m
"You dont need to know all the facts and figures about the campaign; you just need to be excited to turn out Hillary supporters for a big win Monday night.
"If you have made calls before GREAT
Hillary really needs you today and I hope youll find some time to get on the phone
You know what a difference this can make.
"With only one day left until the caucus every Iowan we talk to is absolutely critical—jump on the phone for a few minutes and when Hillary wins the Iowa caucus tomorrow night youll feel great knowing you helped make history.
