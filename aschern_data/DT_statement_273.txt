based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial." Over the past few weeks I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report "Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University Columbia Business School Stanford University and other respected institutions And the response from students was overwhelming Over a five year period more than 10000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump Universitys programs For example:" Indeed these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys all of which can be viewed online at "For those students who decided that Trump Universitys programs were not for them the company had a generous refund policy offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within 3 days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any multi-day program whichever came later." Normally legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment However given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration jobs and unfair trade I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States Many companies – like Ford Nabisco Carrier – are moving production to Mexico Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border This is bad for all Americans regardless of their heritage "Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judges reported associations with certain professional organizations questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judges impartiality It is a fair question I hope it is not the case." While this lawsuit should have been dismissed it is now scheduled for trial in November I do not intend to comment on this matter any further With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades we will win this case!
