"Its no surprise that Donald Trump is defending his most offensive views and extremist allies
This is the man who has spent 15 months insulting nearly every group in America – African Americans Muslims Latinos Native Americans immigrants women veterans people with disabilities and the list goes on

movement to be his campaign CEO and has inspired white supremacists and conspiracy theorists like David Duke and Alex Jones
xa0So its no wonder Trump is standing up for them yet again
xa0This is without a doubt deplorable – but this is who he is
xa0This is what his campaign has always been about
xa0And this is a fight were eager to have
As Hillary said today we wont back down
