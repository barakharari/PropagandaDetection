"A retired auto worker and a new U.S
citizen on why theyre for Hillary Clinton.
Im 62 and I still feel like Ive got a lot of life and a lot of volunteering to do—and I still gotta get paid
Saving our pensions saving social security paying our student loans.
After everything that we invested in the auto industry to have it come to that
Thats when I got heavily involved and realized the seriousness of this situation.
I dont mean African American—a sister meaning a female that understands my pain
Who understands labor and then that your kids—once they grow up you know—theyre still getting paid minimum wage
Shes in touch with being a parent
Shes got more to offer because she is a mother
She feels that mother-child bond and shes a new grandmother so that triples how she feels about children and their welfare
I like everything about Hillary
I like her strength even though she went through some challenges
She stood strong stood firm as a woman
She carried the banner that much higher.
"I came to America as an immigrantxa0seven years agoxa0when I was 14 and I became a citizen a few years ago
The first time I voted was the election of 2014—the local election—and I voted in the primary this year
And Ill be voting in every election from now on
Practicing this democratic role is essential for us as citizens to express our views and its a very important thing to practice voting
We have to be active players.
She was first lady for eight years senator secretary of state
She knows whats going on in the country and the world
And we need somebody who accepts everybody
America is all about diversity immigrants—its not about excluding people
We need it to be united always and forever.
When I immigrated I didnt speak the language and I didnt know anything about the U.S
It was a very challenging thing
I was able to learn the language and become a citizen
And now I use that motivation in my schooling; Im a 4.0 student.
"Im so proud to live in America a country that gave me everything
Im involved in local politics: Im running for the Dearborn Board of Education in November
Im so proud to give back to the country that gave me everything I needed; that gave me opportunity gave me dignity
I always say: I wish nothing but the greatest for America
