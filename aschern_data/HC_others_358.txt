"Donald Trump has stated very clearly throughout his campaign that he will deport everyone who is undocumented something that was reinforced in his speech in Arizona last Wednesday
Beyond forcibly removing every single undocumented person from this country Trump has also promised to rescind DACA and DAPA and deport American citizens who are born to undocumented immigrant parents
What we saw today is Mike Pence and Trumps top campaign officials attempt to mislead voters about their mass deportation policy by using soft words to describe harsh tactics – one of the oldest tricks in the book
Immigrant families know the meanings of humane and fair and can see straight through their cynical ploys
Trumps message to immigrant families is clear: everyone must go.
