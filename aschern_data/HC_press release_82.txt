the Supreme Court But they ruled that though I had clearly been discriminated against I had filed my case too late to be compensated Seven years ago today President Obama signed his first bill into law: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which makes it easier to challenge wage discrimination in court It was an important step toward equal pay for women and an important victory for the increasing number of American households where women are the primary breadwinner Under this law no one else will ever have to accept the gender discrimination I faced without the chance to challenge it in court "But this isnt just my story Its the story of women working full time across this country who despite new protections are on average still earning just 78 cents for every dollar a man earns—with women of color often being shortchanged even more Thats money their families are losing out on." "Our next president can either build on the progress weve made and go even further—or dismiss this important issue Women across this country need more than rhetoric; they need action—they need a fighter in the White House." I firmly believe Hillary Clinton will be that fighter "Hillary has spent decades fighting to advance womens rights and economic opportunities We fought side by side to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Act which she co-sponsored in the United States Senate and she has been a tireless champion for the Paycheck Fairness Act—legislation that would go even further to address the pay gap And shes put issues like equal pay affordable child care paid leave and reproductive rights front and center in her campaign." Hillary understands that these issues cant be dismissed or pushed to the sidelines Theyre not just "social issues"—theyre fundamental to our countrys economic future and they are at the heart of everything shes fighting for on this campaign For Hillary this is about more than politics—its personal She just gets it plain and simple "Of all the candidates in this race she is the one we can count on to be a fierce and uncompromising champion for women for basic fairness and for opportunity for everyone Shes not just a steadfast supporter of issues that affect womens lives; shes someone who has been there She doesnt just say the right things; she does the right things And when it comes to finally closing the gender pay gap once and for all that will make a world of difference."
