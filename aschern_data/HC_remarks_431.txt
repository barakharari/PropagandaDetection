"Thank you Your Eminence Your Excellencies members of the clergy Al and Nan Smith Donald and Melania and all the distinguished guests "You know earlier tonight Al reminded me that when the first Al Smith ran for presi-dent he chose as his running mate the progressive senator from Arkansas Joseph T Robinson who was one of my husbands political heroes." "This work that you do through the dinner — Al youve done it now for 30 — 30 years — is such a labor of love Youve been a hero for both the children of the archdiocese and for the city of New York And I think we all owe Al Smith a great great round of applause." This is such a special event that I took a break from my rigorous nap schedule to be here "And as youve already heard its a treat for all of you too because usually I charge a lot for speeches like this." "But for me it was kind of ironic thinking about a fiery populist Al Smith If he were here today and saw how much money weve raised for needy children hed be very proud." "And if he saw this magnificent room full of plutocrats celebrating his legacy hed be very confused." Its a special honor to be here with Your Eminence Now I know Your Eminence you were criticized for inviting both Donald and me here tonight and you responded by saying "If I only sat down with those who were saints Id be taking all my meals alone." "Now just to be clear I think the Cardinal is saying Im not eligible for sainthood But getting through these three debates with Donald has to count as a miracle." "So I guess Im up against the highest hardest stained-glass ceiling But Your Eminence you deserve great credit for bringing together two people whove been at each others throats — mortal enemies bitter foes; Ive got to ask how did you get the governor and mayor here together tonight?" "Now Ive got to say there are a lot of friendly faces here in this room; people that Ive been privileged to know and to work with I just want to put you all in a basket of adorables." And you look so good in your tuxes; or as I refer to them formal pantsuits And you know because this is a friendly dinner for such a great cause; Donald if at any time
