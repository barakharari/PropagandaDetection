Trump spoke today on the need to serve and protect those who have served and protected us - our police law enforcement and militarypersonnel
In addition he laid out a bold ten point plan for Veterans Reform: 
Trump will appoint a VA Secretary whose sole purpose will be to serve veterans
The Obama Administration has continually placed D.C
bureaucrats needsabove those of veterans this will not happen under a Trump Administration.
Trump will use the powers of the presidency to remove and discipline the federal employees and managers who have violated the publics trust and failedto carry out the duties on behalf of our veterans.
Trump will ask that Congress pass legislation that empowers the Secretary of the VA to discipline or terminate any employee who has jeopardized thehealth safety or well-being of a veteran
Trump will create a commission to investigate all the fraud cover-ups and wrong-doing that has taken place in the VA and present these findings toCongress for to spur legislative reform
Trump will protect and promote honest employees at the VA who highlight wrongdoing and he will guarantee their jobs will be protected
Trump will create a private White House hotline which will be active 24 hours a day answered by a real person
It will be devoted to answeringveterans complaints of wrongdoing at the VA and ensure no complaints fall through the cracks
Trump will stop giving bonuses to any VA employees who are wasting money and start rewarding employees who seek to improve the VAs service cutwaste and save lives.
Trump will reform the visa system to ensure veterans are at the front of the line for health services not the back
Trump will increase the number of mental health care professionals and allow veterans to be able to seek mental health care outside of the VA.
Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice
Under a TrumpAdministration no veteran will die waiting for service
These days are over starting January 2017
