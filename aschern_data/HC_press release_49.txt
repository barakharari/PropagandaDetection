remember vividly the day after the 2008 election when President-elect Obama asked me to come see him in Chicago It turned out that he would ask me to be secretary of state But first we talked about everything he was doing to get ready for his first term—and everything he was learning about the reality of the economic crisis our country was facing The president-elect was getting briefings every day sometimes several times a day And the news was not good He turned to me and said "It is so much worse than they told us." He was right "By the time President Obama was sworn into office we were on the brink of another Great Depression Before the worst was over we were losing 800000 jobs a month 5 million Americans lost their homes and 13 trillion dollars of family wealth was wiped away Meanwhile our auto industry—the pride of American manufacturing and ingenuity for decades—was on the verge of collapse It turned out to be the second-worst financial crisis in our countrys history." "President Obama changed all that Look where we are today Weve had 70 straight months of private-sector job growth Our businesses have created 14.1 million jobs The unemployment rate is the lowest in seven years And the auto industry just had its best year " "Thats a pretty outstanding record for any president—let alone one who took office amid an economic disaster ?Thats not all Weve imposed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s We created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just over a year ago—and its already returned nearly $11 billion to consumers." "Weve restored our standing around the world Under President Obamas leadership we worked with Congress and the United Nations to impose crippling sanctions against Iran which paved the way for a landmark deal that will keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon We stood up for LGBT rights and womens rights around the world We brought Osama bin Laden to justice And thanks to a lot of painstaking diplomacy by the president and his team nearly 200 countries have signed on to a landmark agreement to tackle the urgent threat of climate change." "Then theres the progress weve made toward a cause close to my heart: putting quality affordable health care within reach for everyone Thanks to the Affordable Care Act 18 million Americans now have health coverage Millions more are receiving benefits like free preventive care Americans can sleep
