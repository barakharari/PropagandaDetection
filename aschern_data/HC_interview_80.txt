get it? I had a young woman the other day here in Iowa say I want to go to law school How can I be sure that if I work hard and do well and get a job Im going to get equal pay? And I said OK thats the right question because weve been fighting for this Weve made progress but not near enough Heres exactly what I think we need to do to get it Or young women who say you know I cant balance family and work I had a young woman come to see me holding her 9-month-old baby and she said you know I cant go back to work until I get my baby stabilized I need paid family leave What are you going to do about it? So I think whats happening is as the campaign goes on a lot of young people — and lets focus on young women — are moving from the sort of general either we havent gone far enough or those fights are over and I dont have to worry about it to being much more specific And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries and if Im so fortunate enough to get the nomination then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes weve got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality our drive for justice whether its racism sexism homophobia you name it — we need to address those gaps and the other side doesnt even want to admit they exist So I think were going to have a very positive reaction in the general election between you know the big deniers on the Republican side and you know Lets make progress get things done on my side." Thank you so much One last — just to clarify what you said about the debate Would you like the chairman — the chair of the Democratic National Committee Debbie Wasserman Schultz to approve the MSNBC/NBC debate next week? I would like the chairmen of the party and the campaigns to agree that we can debate in New Hampshire next week OK " That is what Im hoping will happen." " OK Thank you so much Its been an honor to have you on Secretary Hillary Clinton from Iowa Thanks for joining us on HARDBALL tonight." Thanks Chris Good to talk to you again
