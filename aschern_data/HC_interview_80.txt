You know were getting near closing time and closing arguments in the big fight in Iowa and then in New Hampshire coming on quickly
Donald Trump is not going to debate on Fox tomorrow night
Will you debate on our debate? Will you show up?
Look Chris what Ive said through my campaign is that I would look forward to another debate
I am you know anxious if we can get something set up to be able to be there
And so lets try to make it happen.
Well someone has to lead from the front
Will you be there no matter what? Will you show up and wait and see? Will you be there waiting for Bernie Sanders and Martin OMalley? Would you in other words lead the pack in showing up and committing to doing that?
Look Im ready for the debate and I hope Senator Sanders will change his mind and join us
And I think the DNC and the campaign should be able to work this out
Ive said for — you know for a long time that Id be happy to have more debates and I hope we can get this done.
Well if he doesnt show up will you?
Well lets hope that we can get it worked out
I dont want to — you know I dont want to jump the gun and create more problems for everybody trying to get this worked out so we can all come to agreement that the voters of New Hampshire and America deserve to see us you know debating before the New Hampshire primary.
So you wont be there — just a last question on this
You wont be there unless Bernies there.
Well Im not committing to that either Chris
I think we should have another debate
I think people want it
They have called for it
Folks have moved forward trying to get it set up
Weve got you know — look 24 hours in a political campaign is an eternity.
Weve got a little time to try to get everybody on board which would certainly be my preference.
 OK you believe candidates should have the courage to face each other before the — before the caucuses in other words
You think you should be there and he should be there
I think that — you know I agreed we all agreed to go with the process that the DNC had set up
And you know Ive been saying for a while that if they come up with more debates I will be there
And now weve got a real live possibility and I — I personally think it would be great for the — you know the primary
Were moving into the caucus as you know so well on Monday.
 And then once we come out of there whatever happens we should agree to debate in New Hampshire
In other words youre sticking to your commitment I will be there.
I will — I will debate
Now as I say Id want — I want all the campaigns and the DNC to agree
Thats what weve tried to you know do in our side of the ledger here.
And Im pushing people to come to agreement so we can all get out there and debate before the New Hampshire primary.
 Well this is getting very sharply worded as we get closer to the caucuses
The word in "The New York Times
this morning Madam Secretary is that Senator Sanders is readying an attack ad against you
We dont know whether hes going to use it but the language is basically that youre in hock to Wall Street because of the speaking fees youve taken from Goldman Sachs
How do you respond or how will you respond to an eleventh-hour attack like that? 
Well first its really disappointing Chris
You know Senator Sanders has started to get increasingly personal with his attacks
He even compared me to Dick Cheney last week which you know is kind of a low blow
So it would be another escalation and a breaking of his pledge not to go negative
One of the things that I think has been great about the Democratic side is we really have focused on issues while the Republicans have been hurling insults
And I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us as president can actually make a difference in their lives and thats the case Ive been focused on making
So you know it would be a sharp departure by Senator Sanders
And you know the other part of this is anybody who knows me knows you cant buy me
I mean honestly Ive been standing up and fighting and getting knocked around for years trying to get things done that I think would improve peoples lives
And Im not going to stop and that includes anybody trying to you know mess with our financial system.
Well when he uses phrases like — dark phrases like You can draw your own conclusions as to whether youre in hock to Goldman Sachs or anyone — is that — is that a low blow You can draw your own conclusions?
Well I think hes trying to go to the line without going over it
And you know clearly some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it
But I feel very — you know very positive and energized by what Im seeing happening here in Iowa
And I know that I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street abuses to make sure it doesnt ever happen again
Lots of folks from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman have said thats the case because I dont just go after the big banks
You know we already have the authority to do that under Dodd-Frank and I have said I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy
But equally importantly weve got to go after the shadow banking sector
You know lets not forget Lehman Brothers AIG Countrywide Rapovia
And lets also remind people Chris that clearly the billionaires as Bernie likes to say — the billionaires have chosen sides
Theyre running ads against me and trying to you know kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me because they know exactly what I will do because theyve seen me in action
So whether its you know Karl Rove or the hedge fund guys with their own super-PAC or Joe Ricketts jumping in now with a kind of ham-handed effort to look like he was you know going against Bernie when the real point was to you know stir opposition to me
I take that as perversely flattering and as the single best refutation of what Senator Sanders is trying to imply.
Well youre giving us a real rogues gallery here of Dick Cheney and Karl Rove
 "Anyway let me ask you about the slogans
You used a phrase the other day these shouting slogans
Now I know what you mean — Im going to build a wall across the Rio Grande — across — along the Rio Grande River
Im going to make the Mexicans pay for it
But on the Democratic side Senator Sanders says things like free health care or rather government-paid health care for life as a right
He talks about free tuition when you go to a great school like Berkeley or Madison Wisconsin
Free! Free! Is that what you mean this — we had a young guy on yesterday from South Carolina who switched from you to Senator Sanders and he — I went through this list of free things and I said Wheres the money come from? And he says Well we put a man on the moon
And that kind of fantastic — what do you call it — appeal
And then I heard from Sanders the other day that theyre going to stay left right to the general theyre not going to make any appeal to the middle
How do you beat somebody who promises to go hard left right to November and offers all this stuff to people who are 20 years old 22 years old and they dont have to pay much taxes now but you say Look youre going to get free — no more tuition bills no more bills! Youre going to have no health care the rest of your life so forget having to buy insurance
Its a pretty good offer
Is that what you mean by shouting slogans?
 Well I was really more referring to the Republicans as you pointed out initially
And I have been you know pointing out the differences in the approach between myself and Senator Sanders because I know that its more important we actually make progress than fall back into gridlock
And lets take health care as an example
You know weve been trying as Democrats since Harry Truman to get on the path to universal coverage
Before it was called "Obama care
it was called "Hillary care
and I have the scars to prove it
And I was thrilled when President Obama passed and signed the Affordable Care Act
We are now at 90 percent coverage
I sure think we ought to improve it
Ive got plans to get the costs down and make sure we do go after high prescription drug costs and some of the other drivers of health care costs
But I think its a lot smarter to try to go from 90 percent to 100 percent than to throw our country into another contentious debate about health care
Wheres the money going to come from? Whos going to be paying it? If you have health care you like if youre under a private plan do you have to give it up? If youre on Medicare and you work do you have to pay more taxes? All these questions that would be thrown back into the public arena and wed have to start all over again from 0 to 100 percent
I just think we want to stay on the path of making progress
Now some people you know say Oh my gosh thats so pragmatic
Its not you know soaring or whatever they say
Well Im out there talking to people who prescription drug costs have gone up from $200 to $14000
Im talking to people whose insulin cost has gone up three times
Thats not a new drug
That doesnt have any new research in it
Im talking to people who are thanking me for the Affordable Care Act because the lifetime limit the cap has been lifted
And a man yesterday in Davenport said to me Im so grateful because Ive got a granddaughter with a congenital heart condition
These people cant wait Chris
We cant wait for another big debate that promises you know the sky when we know weve got to deliver on the ground
Weve got to help people deal with the problems the issues the challenges theyre facing right now
We have to restore faith that our government can work
And that is what I intend to do as president and Im going to keep fighting for that
And I respect the goal because Senator Sanders and I share the same goal
We want to get to universal coverage
I think my way will get us there faster and provide the health care that the people here in Iowa are telling me they are desperately desperately in need of
Last question and its so important to this campaign
I know you think so
It has to do with history
And its not the only issue in the campaign obviously but if you look at the American Constitution — and youve studied constitutional law — and the fact is that it wasnt until after the civil war that African-American men were given the right to vote in the 15th Amendment
And then women didnt get it until after the First World War
Theres a long lag there
You might get elected president
You may well get elected president
Do you think its — you think young American women — say young women in college 18 to 22 23 — do they get it how long this struggle has been and the fact that its a precarious struggle that could fall back? Do they know that all the rights to choice to equality at workplace where they do get it all were fought for? Do they get it? Thats my simple question
I dont know if they do
Do you think they get it?
Look I think that a lot of young people — and I wouldnt limit it to women
I think young people of every background every racial ethnic religious background are you know trying to understand how best they can participate in our political system and what the stakes are for them
And of course you know if you havent been through a lot of these struggles its easy either not to know about them or to think they didnt go far enough or that you know everything is taken care of
So weve got the two extremes of the argument
But heres what Im hearing at least from the young women who come to see me
They say Hey OK youre for equal pay
What are you going to make sure I get it? I had a young woman the other day here in Iowa say I want to go to law school
How can I be sure that if I work hard and do well and get a job Im going to get equal pay? And I said OK thats the right question because weve been fighting for this
Weve made progress but not near enough
Heres exactly what I think we need to do to get it
Or young women who say you know I cant balance family and work
I had a young woman come to see me holding her 9-month-old baby and she said you know I cant go back to work until I get my baby stabilized
I need paid family leave
What are you going to do about it? So I think whats happening is as the campaign goes on a lot of young people — and lets focus on young women — are moving from the sort of general either we havent gone far enough or those fights are over and I dont have to worry about it to being much more specific
And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries and if Im so fortunate enough to get the nomination then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes weve got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality our drive for justice whether its racism sexism homophobia you name it — we need to address those gaps and the other side doesnt even want to admit they exist
So I think were going to have a very positive reaction in the general election between you know the big deniers on the Republican side and you know Lets make progress get things done on my side.
One last — just to clarify what you said about the debate
Would you like the chairman — the chair of the Democratic National Committee Debbie Wasserman Schultz to approve the MSNBC/NBC debate next week?  I would like the chairmen of the party and the campaigns to agree that we can debate in New Hampshire next week
That is what Im hoping will happen.
Its been an honor to have you on Secretary Hillary Clinton from Iowa
Thanks for joining us on HARDBALL tonight.
Good to talk to you again
