"I am so excited to be here and I want to thank you
And you know I am really sorry and I know there are a lot of people outdoors who cant get in—so I want to give a big shout out to the overflow outside
Im here with a lot of great people who are working so hard on this campaign
I want to thank Ken Evans
Thank you so much Ken
I want to thank three members of Congress: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Congressman Alcee Hastings; and your Congresswoman Lois Frankel
I also want to thank Sheriff Israel for being here
And Mayor Resnick just gave me a key to the city of Wilton Manors
And I want to thank my longtime friend and such a great leader Chad Griffin Human Rights Campaign president
I know that Chad told me there are a bunch of Human Rights Campaign organizers
And as Ive said many times HRC for HRC sounds good to me.n
"Well my friends just nine days left until November the 8th
Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes
And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted
Its great to be here at the Manor Complex a place that means so much to so many
And there have been ups and downs in all that weve gone through over the years and even in this campaign but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you – your lives your futures
The problems that keep you up at night
Thats what Im interested in and thats what Im going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.n
"Thats really what this election is about
Theres a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who as our president can help us get there
So I want you to know – now I just have to say I know Im preaching to the choir
But I also through you want to talk to people who are still making up their minds believe it or not right? Because weve got a choice between a president who will bring us together keep our country safe get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top – or someone whos temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job
You know Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse mislead and discourage the American people
I mean hes such a downer right? And its time for him to stop fear mongering stop distracting from whats really at stake and frankly stop disgracing our democracy
We cant let him get away with this.n
"But heres the good news
Yes America is great and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals
But we are seeing Americans coming together – Democrats Republicans independents – to reject Donald Trumps dark and divisive vision of our country
And its going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days whats at stake
Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us
We dont want a president who demeans women
We dont want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families
We dont want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasnt born in America
We dont want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality
But I want you to know the energy were now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what were against its also about what were for
Because we also share a common vision
Beyond partisanship and politics its a hopeful inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place right?n
"And thats exactly what Im going to be fighting for in these last nine days
Were going to honor people not insult them
Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population
African Americans Latinos immigrants Muslims POWs women
And by what he has said so many others who believe that you have a positive future
I agree with that: you do
And I promise you this: Im going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.n
Now I will tell you my mom taught me to never ever quit and what does that mean? Well that means –"n  "Rise up."n  "You got it
And it also means when youre knocked down what matters is whether you get up again
I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life
Were just getting warmed up right? And we wont be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us
Were not going to be knocked off course
We know how much this election matters and we know how many people are counting on us
So were going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama: When they go low we go high.n "Were going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trumps strategy is real simple
Theyve even said it in his campaign
Heres his strategy about how hes going to win: Get women to stay home
Get young people to stay home
Get people of color to stay home
Get the LGBT committee to say home
Its all part of his scorched earth campaign and it goes against everything we stand for
So you know how were going to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.n
"We need everybody to turn out and vote – women young people people of color the LGBT community Latinos African Americans Americans from all walks of life
Lets break every single record
Lets make that the story of this election
And heres some really good news
More than 20 million people have already voted in this election most of those votes in the last few days 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida
Now you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in
So if all of you vote if your friends your family your coworkers vote if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.n
"And I want you not only coming out for me
I want you to reelect our members of Congress
And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate
And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election listen to this
Weve heard some outrageous things in this campaign
Im sure well hear more in the next nine days
But I got to tell you I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.n
"But yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning
It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York
Now let me say this is important in part to remember
This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS
So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school and all the kids and their families for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine
Because you know back in the 90s some of you remember
Right? Children werent welcomed in school.n
"And then unannounced and uninvited guess who barges in? Donald Trump
He walks right up to the stage
He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation
None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there
He wasnt a donor at all
He had never given a single dollar to help build the school
He just wanted people to think he had
So he sat on the stage through the program even posed for photographs and when it was over he got up and walked out
Now really who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well Ill tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.n
Back in 1997 he was principal for a day at a public school
That was a program we used to have in New York
The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament
He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill
At first the kids and their parents were excited
Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke
So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine
Now this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trumps behavior called the school and donated the $5000
And the coach remembers this woman saying "I am ashamed to be the same species as this man."n "Now I got to say any of you see the debates? Well you know I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job
Right? But a lot of what weve heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern
And heres what the Washington Post concludes
For as long as he has been rich and famous he has wanted people to believe he is generous
He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public even nationally televised promises to give his own money away
It was in large part a façade
And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other peoples giving as his own.n
"Now of course because hes refused to release his tax returns we dont even know if hes ever given anything
But heres what we do know
With Donald its always Donald Trump first and everyone else last
He games the system and he doesnt care whos left holding the bag.n
"And heres what else we know
Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights
And this election will determine whether we continue the progress weve made or let it be ripped away
We know Trump has promised hell appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obamas executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination
And just this week a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees
Its a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trumps golf courses
So I want you just to think.n
Probably there 12 hours a day maybe more when its the summer season
After he told his coworkers he was gay they started harassing him
They even threw rocks and golf balls at him
It got so bad he ended up in the hospital
Now his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing
So finally he went to the police for help
He was too scared even to come back to work
And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.n
"Now this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels
For starters its a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day
And its deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior Trumps business punished the victim for coming forward
Now if thats how Donald Trump runs his business what does it say about how he would run our country? Weve made a lot of progress on LGBT rights but as that story reminds us we still have work ahead dont we?n
"There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday post your Facebook photos on Sunday and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love
So heres what Ill do as president
We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act
And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives
Well work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach
And we will take on homelessness bullying and violence particularly youth homelessness which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids
And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy
LGBT kids dont need to be cured of anything
They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected
And yes were going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.n
"Now some of you know Chad Griffin and others know this issue is really important to me
I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State
I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people
And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example
I want – I want LGBT people in every corner of our country – because dont forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today
Right? And were going to elevate this issue
Were going to talk about it
Were going to reach out.n
"So when you vote in this election remember its not just my name on the ballot
Its who we are as a country
Its every issue we care about
And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake
Dignity and respect for every American is at stake
The future of our economy is at stake.n
"I believe when the middle class thrives Americans thrive
And were going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century too
And if were serious about supporting a middle class were going to be supporting families.n
The other day I was in Pittsburgh
And there was a woman there with her young child
Weve got some folks from Pittsburgh
She was shaking Tim Kaines hand
And she said to him "I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago
And the next day I was fired
It had been a difficult pregnancy
I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover and the answer was No
Dont come back at all
Nobody no parent should ever have to make that kind of choice but thats also true when we talk about paid family leave caring for a spouse or a partner caring for an elderly relative.n "I want us to recognize the way we live today
It is no longer the 1950s
We need to support people who are part of committed relationships of families of marriages and give everybody the support you need to actually do whats the most important thing in life
And that is caring for each other
Were going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare paid family leave earned sick days jobs with rising incomes
Were going to raise the national minimum wage
No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.n
"And yes were going to guarantee equal pay for womens work
Were going to make sure
Were going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer
And Ive got to tell you thats such a stark contrast with Trump
He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy – thats with trillions of dollars going to the top – that will somehow trickle down
I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up
And thats exactly what were going to do.n
"So my friends weve got a guy who wont pay his income tax
I mean Ive got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didnt pay income tax for like 20 years he said that was smart
And I thought to myself how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean really
And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But its serious because it means hes paid zero zero for our military our vets for healthcare for Pell Grants for our universities our colleges our highways
This is Trump to a T.n
"The stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like hes done something well he shows up and criticizes our country
He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments
He chose to make his products in other countries not America
Hes built a career on stiffing small businesses
My dad was a small business owner
Im sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.n
"So my friends weve got work to do
And lets get to that work
Weve got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote
I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future you voted for a better America
And look how easy it is
Wilton Manors City Hall is just a half a mile down the street from where we are right now
And if you are registered in Broward County you can go to any early-vote location in the county from 7 a.m
And if you have been mailed your ballot make sure you fill it out and mail it back today

I dont want anybody waking up on Wednesday morning and seeing the results and getting depressed
We dont want that to happen in this election
Right?"n  "No!"n  "I dont want people to be sad because they didnt do their part
We cant let that happen
And I have to ask you if you – if you know anybody if you know anybody who is thinking about voting for Trump youve got to stage an intervention
Do everything you can to try to convince that person that they surely care about something that Donald Trump is on the wrong side of because I can guarantee you they do because after all friends dont let friends vote for Trump
Right?n "So I am so grateful to all of you
Have many of you have already voted? Okay
So now how many of you will help us get somebody else to vote? Thats whats going to make the difference
Lets make sure its the right kind of change
Were going to do everything we can to build a stronger better fairer America coming together healing the divides among us
And were going to prove once and for all that love trumps Hate
