"Tomorrow we mark the date on which hundreds of thousands of Americans marched on Washington on behalf of human rights
Standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial Dr
uttered words now etched forever in our nations history: "His call to action sparked the momentum needed to pass the Voting Rights Act – xa0knocking down legal barriers that had stood for generations and ensuring every American could exercise their constitutional right to vote
"In 2016 weve come a long way since the days of Jim Crow
Yet too many Americans still face systemic racism and constant assaults on their franchise
Something is profoundly wrong when decades after Dr
King addressed the nation so many Americans still feel that their country values them less simply because of the color of their skin
"Thats just one reason why the stakes in this election are unlike any we have faced before
Those brave men and women who marched and sat and bled for civil rights in America must not have done so in vain
"As President Ill stand up to bluster and bigotry and fight back against efforts to restrict access to the ballot
Lets make it easier for people to vote not harder
Lets make sure every state has at least 20 days of in-person voting and no one ever has to wait more than 30 minutes to cast their ballot
And lets automatically register every American to vote on their 18th birthday
"The power of American democracy comes from the fact that no one is left behind – no matter where they come from what they look like or who they love
Thats what I mean when I say that were stronger together
"So today lets continue to be inspired by the self-evident truths that first united our nation and live up to what a young minister dreamed and declared fifty-three years ago.
