Hello Grand Valley! Thank you! Thank you.n It is great to be back in western Michigan
Are there any Lakers here?n Oh my gosh
I am so thrilled to be here
I want to thank the president of this great university Tom Haas the faculty the staff the students
I want to thank Brandon Dillon the Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party
And I especially really want to thank you for sending Debbie Stabenow to the United States Senate.n "I have also the great personal experience and privilege of having worked with Debbie gotten to know her become a friend of hers and I am so excited at the possibility that Ill be able to work with her again
But I want you to know this - and I really really hope youll tell folks because there is no more dedicated effective member of the United States Senate than Debbie Stabenow.n
"She fights for all of you every day but she does it with that smile that never leaves her face
And she brings people together who are on opposite sides of issues because she just keeps talking
And dont we need more of that in Washington where people actually talk and listen to each other
So its wonderful to be with all of you and to be introduced by Debbie.n
Are you ready to vote tomorrow Michigan? Are you ready to help get your friends to vote tomorrow? That is clearly the right answer because we have a really important election tomorrow.n "The choice in this election could not be clearer
And I know that for many people youve gone back and forth youve thought about what to do and I really respect that
But let me say this
This election is basically between division and unity in our country.n
"Its between strong and steady leadership or a loose cannon who could put everything at risk
It is between an economy that works for everyone or one that is even more stacked for those at the top
And I want each and every one of you to be thinking through about all the issues that you care about
Because although my name and my opponents name will be on the ballot those issues and those values are on the ballot as well.n
And as you think about what you care about and what you want your future to look like you have to recognize this is a consequential election
I have been privileged to know a lot of our presidents over the past decades and people who ran for president
I was privileged to know as a college student Gerald Ford.n "In fact I had an internship with the House Republican Conference Committee which he headed after my junior year in college
So when I say Ive gotten to know a lot of our presidents and people whove run for president it goes back a ways
And heres what I want you to understand
I didnt agree with everything they did or said
We had differences and politics and policies and sometimes on principle but I never doubted I never doubted that they were fit to serve as our president and commander-in-chief.n
"Thats why this election is so different
And its why so many Republicans have spoken out to endorse me and support me and who have taken very courageous stands against the nominee of their own party
Because they believe that we must put country ahead of party when it comes to this election.n
I was at Kent State in Ohio last week and I was introduced by a gentleman by the name of Bruce Blair
Blair had served in the Air Force he was a young officer assigned to be what was called a launch officer
That meant he served his time every day sitting in a bunker where the controls for launching nuclear weapons were housed
And his job - imagine the responsibility
A young Air Force officer in his twenties waiting to hear whether or not an order is given for him to launch nuclear weapons.n And Bruce Blair explained that there is no appeal from a presidents order to do that
The joint chiefs of our military forces cant say "No dont do it.
Theres no veto from Congress or anyone else
And the time between the order being given and the actual launch is four minutes.n "So after watching this election Mr
Blair began contacting others who had served in this incredibly responsible position to share his concerns about what he was hearing and seeing
And several dozen of them - Id never met them before - several dozen of them wrote a letter explaining why they could never support Donald Trump to be our commander-in-chief.n
The awesome responsibility that is housed in one person is something I want you to think about between now and the time you vote
Because I will pledge to you that I will exercise the greatest care and responsibility in all of the powers invested in the office of the presidency.n I also want to pose to you a contrast in visions
Did any of you see the debates? First of all I did stand for four and a half hours with Donald Trump on the stage proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president.n "But I have to say in addition to that there were so many things that he said that of course I sometimes was surprised by
But the theme that ran through much of his rhetoric was the presentation of a dark and divisive vision for America
Now I have to tell you I know weve got problems
Ive spent 18 months traveling around our country talking to - by now - hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people hearing whats on peoples minds
Weve got challenges but Americas always had challenges
And since when do we become pessimistic and not able to think about what we can do to overcome those challenges and solve those problems together?n
"I often didnt recognize the country that Donald Trump was describing
Because from my perspective looking back at our history we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us
And you can vote for a hopeful inclusive big-hearted America that will set the stage for an even better future.n
"And I want to say especially to the students who are here - I really believe that Americas best days are still ahead of us if we reach for them together.n
Our core values are being tested in this election
But my faith in our future has never been stronger
Last night in Manchester New Hampshire I was introduced by Mr
Khizr Khan.n Some of you know or remember that his son Captain Khan serving in the United States Army was killed serving in Iraq
And like at the Democratic Convention this summer he spoke powerfully about what America means to him
And how we have to defend our values and our Constitution that are the envy of the rest of the world
People look at us with yearning
They see that we are a beacon of freedom hope and opportunity for people right here at home.n When I heard Mr
Khan speak at the convention and I heard him again last night I was so touched because what he said exhibited a love of our country
He said that when he started hearing Donald Trump speak and all of the things he said about so many people not only Muslims but African-Americans and Latinos and POWs and women and so many people - when he heard it he couldnt help but think as he walked around his house - he has a room where his sons medals - he got the Bronze Star he got the Purple Heart - the flag that was draped on his coffin - is respectfully presented in the box that he was given it in
And he thought to himself "Would there be any room for my son in Donald Trumps America?"n Think about that for a minute
Because every single one of us has something to contribute
We are already great but we can be greater
And we will be greater.n "I love our country and I believe in the American people and I know there is nothing we cant do when we make up our minds
Throughout our history generations of Americans have risen together to meet the tests of their time
They built the greatest middle class the world has ever known
They marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and union rights for LGBT rights rights for people with disabilities.n
"And now now weve got to come together and we have to prove we can meet the chal-lenges of our time
Weve got to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top.n
If you believe as I do that America thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow.n We are going to make the biggest investment in good paying jobs since World War II
Our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems.n "These are jobs we need doing in American and these are jobs that cannot be exported
Theyve got to be done right here in Michigan and across our country.n
And we are going to invest in new jobs in advanced manufacturing
I am not one of these folks who think "We just cant make it in America anymore.
And Ill tell you why
Because if we have a plan and we actually commit to fulfilling that plan we can lead the world in precision machining in 3-D printing
Were not competing for low-wage jobs were competing with Germany for high manufacturing high- skilled jobs.n And we are going to have clean renewable energy jobs as a way to fight climate change
As you heard my opponent chose to make many of his products overseas
And as I pointed out in the last debate he buys cheap Chinese steel and aluminum instead of good American steel made by American steel workers.n "Hes gone all over this country and hes gone all over Michigan talking about how hes gonna really get more jobs and hes going to bring back what used to be there
Well Ill tell you what
Look at his record dont just listen to his rhetoric.n
"Because I have a different idea
Were going to invest in America again
And for every-body who is frustrated and anxious and maybe even angry because they feel left out left behind that Americas not working the way it should - I understand that
I represented upstate New York for eight years and I saw first hand a lot of the loss of jobs and factories picking up and moving out.n
"But I also realized that anger is not a plan
Youve got to come together and figure out what is it were gonna do to bring new jobs back and create more opportunity for people.n
"And Ill just tell you that I believe that weve got to defend the American workers right to organize and bargain for better wages and benefits.n
"Were gonna get incomes rising here in western Michigan and across this state
And were also gonna do more to help small business
My dad was a small businessman
He ran a printing plant that printed fabrics for draperies and I would from time to time help him out
You take a silkscreen you put it down on the long table you pour the paint in you do the squeegee you pick it up - it wasnt automated we were the automaters - and youd go all the way down to one table youd go to the other table
So I know how hard people in small business work.n
And I also know something else
Donald Trump made a lot of money off the backs of small business people and contractors by stiffing them and refusing to pay his bills
And I have said "I am sure glad my dad never got a contract from Donald Trump because we could not have afforded that."n "But its not just enough to grow the economy
We have to make it fairer
And if you believe we need a fairer economy then you have to vote
I think the best antidote for whatever ails a person is a good job
I believe in hard work
Thats how I was raised
But I also believe that if you work hard and you work full time you shouldnt still be in poverty at the end of the year
And Im gonna raise the national minimum wage.n
"And one of the things Ive heard all over America especially from young families really from all families but particularly young families is how hard it is to do so many of the things that are expected - like where do you find affordable quality childcare? In lots of states its more expensive than college tuition
Were gonna get the cost of childcare down
Were going to have a paid family leave program so that when you have a sick relative or youre sick you wont lose your job.n
I saw the folks over there holding up the Tim Kaine sign and I really appreciate that
I got to tell you - Tim and I were in Pittsburgh last month with a big crowd and we couldnt get everybody in like today so Tim went out to say hello to people and he saw a woman holding a baby probably about three years old
And he stopped to talk to her and she said "I came here because I wanted to tell you and to tell Hillary Clinton what happened to me.
She said that "I had my baby it was a hard labor and delivery and I needed some time off
And I called by boss and said the doctors want me to take some time off and so I wont be in for - I think she said two weeks - and they said "OK
Youre fired."n "That is legal in America still
And what that does is to say that - wait a minute do we really value children? Do we really value families? And weve got to have a system that is fair to employers and fair to employees because you got to be able to balance work and family in todays America.n
"And then finally I think it is way past time to guarantee equal pay for womens work.n
"And you know I gotta say - this always gets a huge round of applause as you can tell - but this is not just a womans issue
If you have a wife a mother a sister a daughter whos in the work force you want her to be paid what she deserves to be paid to help you and your family.n
"Just about everything Ive said so far my opponent disagrees with
And whenever I talk about affordable childcare and paid family leave and equal pay - he says Im playing the womans card and you know what I say if thats the case? Then deal me in.n
And heres what else I want you to know
Its fair to ask "How are you going to pay for that?
Thats not only fair thats necessary to ask
Because I want to be a good steward of your tax dollars just as I expect youre a good steward of your family budget
I have proposed a very simple formula
I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250000 a year.n "And for small businesses were gonna cut your taxes because I know a lot of small businesses need that kind of tax relief
So instead were going where the money is to the millionaires and the billionaires and the big corporations.n
And that is in stark contrast to what Donald Trump has proposed
His whole economic plan is cut trillions of dollars in taxes from millionaires and billionaires and corporations
That is trickle-down economics on steroids
I think the way you build an economy is from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down.n "When you think about it Donald hasnt paid anything for 20 years
Hes paid zero to support our military our vets Pell grants for students here at Grand Valley our high-ways - and I am still pondering I am just pondering how anybody can lose a billion dollars in one year.n
"Especially when youre running casinos
I do not understand that
But that will be one of the mysteries in this campaign because hes not going to release his tax returns now and the time you start voting
And that sort of suggests there must be something really terrible in those tax returns because everybody else for more than 40 years has released them.n
But what we know is his economic approach will cost us jobs not create jobs
And we cant afford that
We need to keep building
We have recovered from the worst financial crash since the Great Depression but were not where we need to be yet
The last thing we need is a failed economic policy coming back in and pushing us back down
And depriving people of the jobs that we want to create.n
And if you believe all of our kids should have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip code they live in then you have to vote.n "And if you believe college should be affordable you have to vote
Ive got to say I am proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran
It was a campaign about ideas and issues not insults
And when it was over we actually got together
We wanted to figure out how we can work together to actually produce on some of the goals that we both shared
So Bernie and I worked on this plan together.n
"Public colleges and universities should be tuition-free for everyone who makes less than a $125000 a year
And they should be debt-free for everyone else because nobody should go into debt
And if you have gone into debt if youre among the millions of Americans who are struggling - as I see some hands pointing in the air - paying back your student debt we are going to help you pay it down and pay it off.n
It makes no sense at all
We have interest rates that are really low right now
Buy a car for what 1 or 2 percent
You can buy a house for 34 percent
There are so many people who are paying 8 10 12 higher - 8 10 12 percent interest - how much? Twelve point seven
I got to tell you friends
The federal government should not be making money off of sending kids to college.n "I cant wait to roll up my sleeves with Debbie and Bernie and were gonna get to work right after this election if I am fortunate enough to win.n
Working for children and families has been the cause of my life but its never been more important than it is right now
And that has to be our mission together
Doing all we can to help every American and especially every young American and every child in America to have the chance to live up to their God-given potential
I will wake up every single day in the White House trying to figure out what I can do to make that a reality for you.n
"So after tomorrow the work will begin and one of the highest priorities that I feel an obligation to address is how we bring our country together
A lot of people say weve got to heal our country or as the Bible says repair the breach
Because we have so much divisiveness right now
Weve got to start listening to each other
I know it is unusual I admit for somebody running for president especially the day before an election but Ive been saying this for months
To say that we need more of two things right now.n
We need more love and kindness in America.n I dont know about you I dont know about you but I bet everyone of us has received a kindness and maybe I hope weve all extended one
I am standing here today because my mother who was abandoned by her parents rejected by her grandparents went to work at the age of 14 as a maid and a babysitter was extended kindness
Not by those who should have loved her but by others
The first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch who began bringing extra food
The woman whose house she went to work in who knew that my mother wanted to go to high school
She would have been a freshman in high school when she had to leave her grandparents home and she got this job
And that woman said "I know you want to go to high school
If you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school but youll have to come back because well need you in the late afternoon."n Now that may sound harsh to say to a 14-year old but to my mother it was a gift
I tell you this because we all have to start thinking about how we want to be treated and what that means about how we treat others
And …n "Theres a version of the golden rule in every major religion
And it is a reminder that every one of us gets knocked down
The question as my mother would say is are you gonna get back up? And for people in our country who feel like theyve been knocked down and nobody cares nobodys paying attention heres what I want you to know
If you give me the honor of being your president Im gonna do everything I can to get this country and everybody in it back up on our feet moving forward together.n
Because I want to be a president for all Americans.n "Democrats Republicans Independents
Not just the people who support me everybody in this country
Because I believe with all my heart each of us has a role to play in building a better future
So lets take that first step tomorrow
