"The Supreme Courts decision in Whole Womans Health v
Hellerstedt is a victory for women across America
By striking down politically motivated restrictions that made it nearly impossible for Texans to exercise their full reproductive rights the Court upheld every womans right to safe legal abortion no matter where she lives
"I applaud everyone who flooded the Texas Capitol to speak out against these attacks on womens health the brave women and men across the country who shared their stories and the health care providers who fought for their patients and refused to give up
"Our fight is far from over
In Texas and across the country a womans constitutional right to make her own health decisions is under attack
In the first three months of 2016 states introduced more than 400 measures restricting access to abortion
Weve seen a concerted persistent attack on womens health and rights at the federal level
Meanwhile Donald Trump has said women should be punished for having abortions
He also pledged to defund Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v
"Todays decision is a reminder of how much is at stake in this election
We need a President who will defend womens health and rights and appoint Supreme Court justices who recognize Roe v
We must continue to protect access to safe and legal abortion â€“ not just on paper but in reality.
