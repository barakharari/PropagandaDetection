you about whether—going with Chicago—right now Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been under fire for what he may have known about a shooting incident Do you think he still has the credibility to heal the wounds in Chicago between the African-American community and law enforcement? Look like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and in fact urged that it include the entire Chicago police department "This is not a problem that is unique to Chicago unfortunately and weve got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard." But do you think he still has the credibility to do that? " Well thats going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove." Very quickly the movie "13 Hours" about the incident in Benghazi I know theres a lot of chatter about the movie itself But let me ask you—the controversy involves whether or not everything was done that night to rescue Ambassador Stevens Looking back do you believe everything was done that night that could have been done to save his life? Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation the answer to that is yes That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything "And I cant speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization I testified for more than 11 hours as you know I answered every question I was asked My real focus Chuck is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harms way—military or civilian diplomats or our soldiers—we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it." All right Secretary Clinton I have to leave it there We look forward to seeing you tonight on stage in Charleston for the Democratic debate Great " Thats right here on NBC Thank you."
