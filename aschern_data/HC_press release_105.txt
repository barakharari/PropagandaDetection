Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly on supporting each other exploring space and electing Hillary Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly know a little something about grit courage and hard work
"After surviving a near-fatal shooting while at an event in her district former Congresswoman Giffords began the long road to recovery
With the support of her husband Mark Kelly a former astronaut getting better became her lifes work.
And so did taking on one of the largest best-funded special interests in Washington
"Gabby and Mark have made it their mission to stand up to the gun lobby and bring together Americans who support commonsense gun reforms
And right now theyre logging hours (and miles) on the campaign trail helping to elect Hillary Clinton—the only candidate in this election who has the courage and commitment to confront the epidemic of gun violence in America and deliver real solutions.
Between stops Gabby and Mark answered a few questions about standing up to the gun lobby supporting each other and what makes them hopeful
 Like I said in Iowa with Hillary and Mark speaking is hard for me
Getting on stage to give a speech is not nearly as easy as it used to be
I still do hours of speech therapy each week
And come January I want to say these two words: "Madam President.
"So it was important for me to talk to voters in person about why Im with Hillary: Because shes fighting for our families and for safer communities and shes the only candidate in this race with the toughness and the record to stand up to the gun lobby in The White House
I want to make my voice heard and Im going to keep talking to voters about why Im with her.
 I admire that Hillary has always been the kind of leader who takes on the tough fights
I admire that throughout her incredible career she has always stood up for common sense and stood up to the gun lobby
While the other candidates for president seem downright terrified of the gun lobby Hillary seems fearless
"As I like to say strong women get things done
We need more women leaders in public service and at every level of elected office
Im excited to see Hillary be the first woman in the White House
All of us need to work hard to make sure that happens!
 The way Gabby has approached her recovery has really showed me what toughness and courage is all about
As shell tell you her mantra has been "move ahead.
Im just so proud of her
"It has not been an easy road but we are both very grateful to have a second chance at service and remain focused on the progress shes made and the goals she is working toward now.
Sometimes when Gabbys getting ready to leave the house to go to a rehab appointment shell look at me on her way out the door pump her fist and say "Fight fight fight!
She inspires me every single day
 We have a gun violence crisis that makes our country stand out in the worst of ways
And unfortunately the gun lobby and the candidates it backs seem to want to protect this dangerous status quo
We think our country has to do better—and we think we can
Our next president can continue to make the case for Congress to finally act to keep guns out of the wrong hands; they can stand up for common sense
"Unfortunately Congress remains in the gun lobbys grip
So if Congress wont act to reduce gun violence then we can work to have a different Congress.
"Thats where we can all play a role: we can decide we will only support candidates at every level of elected office - whether they are running for your state legislature for governor for Congress or for the White House—who support commonsense ideas like background checks for all gun sales and have the toughness to stand up to the gun lobby
We can call our elected representatives
And we can work hard to help put a strong pro-commonsense leader like Hillary in the White House.
I would ask all Americans to consider that you dont need to be a scientist to believe in science and accept the findings of the scientific community.
"I would ask them to think about the Cold War when the Soviet Union beat us to space
When the Soviets launched Sputnik into space—becoming the first nation on earth to send an object off of our planet—we didnt deny it had happened
We didnt choose to ignore what our scientists at NASA were saying—based on the evidence—had taken place: The Soviets had put a satellite into orbit
Instead we invested in our space program in science and in discovery
And we became leaders in space exploration
It was a huge boon to our economy to our global leadership and to our national security.
"When it comes to our changing climate I would ask Americans to listen to our nations military; to our top intelligence officials; to our business leaders; and to the majority of the worlds scientific community.
"And I would ask them to listen to our nations astronauts too
Because when you see our incredible planet from 250 miles up—as it sits there floating in the blackness of space with this tiny sliver of an atmosphere protecting it—you have a pretty unique perspective on why we need to take care of it.
Heres what makes us hopeful and optimistic: The millions of Americans who are calling for commonsense change that makes our communities safer from gun violence.
The leaders in the states who are taking responsible to keep guns out of the wrong hands
The voters in states like Washington who passed background checks at the ballot box
"Having a president in the White House who acted to keep guns out of the wrong hands since Congress wouldnt.
And knowing we have a candidate for president like Hillary who has the toughness to take on the gun lobby
