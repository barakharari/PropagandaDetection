   I hope you will fight for me
And I promise you this I will stand up and fight for you every single day of this campaign
And then when we win I will fight for you in the White House
Thank you and god bless you
A powerful close to Hillary Clintons last campaign event of the night Sunday
Former secretary of state spent most of the day making her way through Iowa in a last ditch effort to rally caucusgoers ahead of tonights vote
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joins us now
How are you feeling and how do you plan to spend the next 12 hours? 
I am so proud of the campaign we have run here in Iowa
Ive got the most dedicated campaign team the organizers who have been on the ground the thousands of volunteers
We actually knocked on 125000 doors this weekend
So there is just a lot of excitement and energy
Im urging everybody to come out and caucus tonight to be part of this unique American process
I hope they will come out and caucus for me.
So Secretary lets talk about the issue that has bedeviled your campaign
That of course is the ongoing investigation into your e-mails
On Friday the State Department withheld 22 e-mails
Because of material deemed top secret
I know you have been asked this six ways to Sunday along the campaign trail and I know that youve always said there is nothing there but your opponents have said that this is big
Its is a big deal
How do you convince voters today not to be concerned about this?
Well Alisyn there is nothing new
And I think the facts are quite helpful here
Its a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi
Just a lot of innuendo a lot of attacks
I just know that after I testified for 11 hours answered every question nothing new came up
Most voters have made up their minds
And Im grateful for that
And I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly whats going on here
I never made any different explanation than the one that I have made over and over again
I take classified information seriously
I did not send or receive any material marked classified and I want all of these released
This is a dispute about retroactive classification quite a mouthful
So what people talk to me about is how Im going to get incomes up how Im going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down and make college affordable and relieve student debt
Thats whats on voters minds
And thats what Im talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight.
 Um but Secretary Clinton something does seem to be happening with this investigation or at least the FBI seems to be talking about it more because in the past week several media outlets have said that their sources in the FBI say quote "somethings going to happen.
What does that mean to you? 
It means people are selectively leaking and making comments that have no basis in anything Im aware of
And you know I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course get it resolved
But I can tell you Alisyn that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks
And Im glad it isnt
Because the facts are the facts
No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families
And Ive been thrilled at the kind of reaction and response Ive been getting the crowds that we had
That last event last night was just overwhelming
Im looking forward to people coming out expressing their opinion about who can be the best president and commander in chief for the Democratic Party and then getting on to win the Democratic nomination and being successful next November.
 Yesterday "The New York Times
They wrote that you are the right choice in terms of experience and vision
Im sure that was music to your ears
Do you think "The New York Times
endorsement plays in Iowa?  Well I dont know
But I know "The Des Moines Register
does and they endorsed me
I know "The Boston Globe
matters and a lot of the newspapers in New Hampshire that have endorsed me and this is very gratifying because yeah there is a lot of static that goes on and the Republicans and their allies are determined to do everything they can to try to bring me down
They dont know me very well
Because I dont quit when Im fighting for what I believe in
And I believe that I can be the president who makes progress with people
And Im just going to stick with it
And so when very respectable and responsible outlets like "The Register
and others look at all the candidates interview us ask us really hard questions and conclude that Im their choice for president I find that incredibly validating
And I do hope that voters pay attention to it because its a pretty tough vetting process they go through
Secretary Clinton thats talk about the Republicans and whats going on in terms of how the electorate feels
I know that you know that this campaign has been about how angry and how anxious people are feeling out there and of course all of the division in this country
Some people say we have never seen anything like it
Youve made a point during the campaign of talking about how you dont really like how the Republicans do become in many ways
So how would you bring the country together including Republicans?
Well the same way I always have
When Im not actually running for office I work closely with everybody including Republicans to find common ground
Thats what I did when I helped to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids
I worked with Democrats and Republicans
Its what I did when I got to the Senate and you know worked with Republicans to get health care for our National Guard and Reserve members when they werent being deployed
I worked on responding to 9/11
I found common ground on a number of issues with respect to health care and the like
As secretary of state the same thing
So Alisyn I think that youve got to work at it every single day
You have to build the relationships and you have to be willing to try to meet people where they are and move them over
Thats the way politics works in America
Thats the way our system is set up to work
Now we can get frustrated by it
We can wish that it were smoother
But Im very proud of the record that President Obama has compiled
You know the Affordable Care Act the Dodd-Frank regulations on Wall Street getting our economy out of the ditch
The Republicans put it into working to put those sanctions on Iran the effort I led
So I know how you get things done
I am a progressive who wants to make progress and actually produce real results in peoples lives
Im laying out the plans that I have
Im asking people to look at them and Im asking people to hold me accountable
Because I want to get back to working together to try to unite this country to make it possible for us to set big goals and achieve them
Thats what I intend to do.
Lets talk about how this differs for you than 2008
Once again you find yourself here in Iowa with an opponent who some think sort of came out of nowhere but who has garnered a lot of excitement
So why isnt this deja vu all over again for you today?
Well look I always thought wed have a close contest and I think that is good
Its good for the Democratic Party
But Im thrilled at my campaign and we learned a lot of lessons
We have applied those lessons
We have got a great team working literally around the clock
I think Im a better candidate
I think my experience as secretary of state gave me a depth and understanding about what the next president will face that frankly nobody else running on either side could have
And I think that what voters are looking for is a way out of their frustration
You know what happened in the Great Recession was a body blow
I mean 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million houses were lost and $13 trillion and family wealth was wiped out
People havent gotten a raise
They have been working but they dont feel like they are getting ahead
So they deserve â€” the American people deserve to be worried
But what Im offering is a way forward
You know once you get through the anger and the political attacks and all the rest of it people have to ask themselves who can do the most for me and my family? Who can protect our country? Who can get the economy going and incomes rising and make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down? I know how to do this and Im ready
Im experienced and I think I have got the best shot at becoming both the nominee and the next president.
 Secretary Clinton we will be watching of course with great interest what unfolds over the next 12 hours
Thanks so much for taking time to be on NEW DAY
Im drinking tea and honey right now
