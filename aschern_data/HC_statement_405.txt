This bombshell report reveals the colossal nature of Donald Trumps past business failures and just how long he may have avoided paying any federal income taxes whatsoever
In one year Donald Trump lost nearly a billion dollars
He stiffed small businesses laid off workers and walked away from hardworking communities
And how did it work out for him? He apparently got to avoid paying taxes for nearly two decades â€“ while tens of millions of working families paid theirs
Now that the gig is up why doesnt he go ahead and release his returns to show us all how smart he really is?
