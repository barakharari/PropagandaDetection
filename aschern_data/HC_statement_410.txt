"Since 1977 the Association of Professional Flight Attendants has represented nearly 25000 flight attendants of American Airlines
Through its relentless advocacy and activism APFA has fought to create better and fairer working conditions both on the ground and in the skies
And Im proud to have earned their endorsement
"APFA understands whats at stake in this election
Donald Trump supports a tax system rigged for the rich and powerful
And we just learned hes likely been exploiting that system to avoid paying taxes for years â€“ even though hes argued that wages for hardworking Americans are too high
"Trump personally hired a union-busting firm to keep workers at his Las Vegas hotel from organizing
He even opposes policies that would make it easier for Americans to balance work and family like guaranteeing paid leave for all families
And he has said that women can earn the same as men only if they do as good a job
"In a Clinton-Kaine Administration working families will always have a champion in the White House
Well reject bad trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership stand up to attacks on workers and fight back against to discriminatory policies
Im so grateful to APFA for their support and I look forward to having their spirit and experience at my side as we build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top.
