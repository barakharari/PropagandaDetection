"So Im excited about the campaign but Im even more excited about getting to work for you – being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody I mean that is how I was raised in my church and by my family and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate Tim Kaine – its right here – is real simple: I want you to know what we say were going to do because I want you to hold me accountable I dont believe in bait and switch where I say oh were going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else That kind of reminds you of somebody doesnt it? No heres what were going to try to do Were going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class That is not going to happen when I am president." "So please join this campaign in the last 36 days Talk to your friends Remember friends dont let friends vote for Trump I am motivated every day because now Im a grandmother – two beautiful grandchildren – and I think about their future I think about their lives I think about our country I want our country to be the land of opportunity The place where dreams do come true if youre willing to work for them Not just for my grandchildren but for every child I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential And if you will help me win this election and then help me work to make it come true we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of." Thank you and God bless you!"
and I worked tirelessly and we got them We did that There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of."
