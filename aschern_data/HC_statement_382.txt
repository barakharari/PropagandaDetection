"Donald Trump the Republican nominee for President has a pattern ofxa0inciting people to violence
Whether this is done to provokexa0protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke it is anxa0unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of Commander in Chief.xa0This kind of talk should be out of bounds for a presidentialxa0candidate just like it should be out of bounds for a presidentialxa0candidate to peddle a conspiracy theory about the President of thexa0United States for five years
But weve seen again and again that noxa0amount of failed resets can change who Donald Trump is
He is unfitxa0to be President and it is time Republican leaders stand up to denouncexa0this disturbing behavior in their nominee.
