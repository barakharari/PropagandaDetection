"Last night I was grossly generalistic and thats never a good idea I regret saying half – that was wrong But lets be clear whats really deplorable is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the so-called alt-right movement to run his campaign and that David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their values Its deplorable that Trump has built his campaign largely on prejudice and paranoia and given a national platform to hateful views and voices including by retweeting fringe bigots with a few dozen followers and spreading their message to 11 million people Its deplorable that hes attacked a federal judge for his Mexican heritage bullied a Gold Star family because of their Muslim faith and promoted the lie that our first blackxa0president is not a truexa0American So I wont stop calling out bigotry and racist rhetoric in this campaign I also meant what I said last night about empathy and the very real challenges we face as a country where so many people have been left out and left behind As I said many of Trumps supporters are hard-working Americans who just dont feel like the economy or our political system are working for them Im determined to bring our country together and make our economy work for everyone not just those at the top Because we really are stronger together."
