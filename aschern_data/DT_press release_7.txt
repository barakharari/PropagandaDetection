Trump announced that he has received the endorsement of former Ted Cruz supporter and respected New Hampshire activist and entrepreneur Andrew Hemingway
Hemingway will play a key role in assisting the campaign as a state co-chair in New Hampshire
Trump stated "I love the people of New Hampshire and have made many great friends over the years
We have a great team in place the biggest crowds and continue to lead all the polls
Andrew is a great addition and with his help we will win New Hampshire and Make America Great Again!
"Hemingway served as the state director for Newt Gingrichs 2012 presidential campaign and he is a former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Liberty Caucus
He is currently the CEO of TheMountain.com a New Hampshire-based business that employs over 200 Granite Staters.
Trump built the most robust grassroots network out of all candidates in the race
He has engaged thousands of Granite Staters who had never found a reason to participate in the past
He is earning the support of these voters with the straight-talk they have been seeking for years
Trump has the business experience and leadership abilities that the other candidates in this race lack
We cannot afford to elect another Washington insider that promises one thing and does another.
Trump will be in Claremont New Hampshire for a rally where Mr
Hemingway will speak during the pre-program and last night Mr
Trump visited nearby Lowell Massachusetts where he hosted a record crowd of nearly 10000 people
