"I really believe part of what this campaign has to do is rebuild peoples faith in our national mission" Hillary said "How do we get the economy to work? How do we get the government to work?

"I dont think any right that we have is less important than any other issue" Hillary said "You know I have said repeatedly ?I am going to attack income inequality and I think I have a pretty good plan to do so I dont just tell you what Im against I tell you what Im for and how I would do it "But there are other forms of inequality There is desperate education inequality in America and I think every kid deserves a good teacher and a good school regardless of the ZIP code that he or she lives in Racial inequality sexual orientation inequality gender inequality So when somebody says ?Yeah yeah its important but lets talk about the really important issues Dont let us get distracted from hearing the same thing weve heard now over and over again about income inequality that bothers me and I did speak out about it."
do we get the government to work? How do we get our political system to work? And I feel strongly that I owe people a clear set of ideas and I want to lay those out "And I know that sometimes I get criticized for ?Oh my gosh there she goes with another plan You know ?Forget the plan just you know do the rhetorical flourish I really believe that when this is all over—and I will have won hopefully—in large measure it will be because I came out and told people ?Heres what I want to do heres how I think I can do it here are the results I believe I can get and I want you to hold me accountable for it I think thats what politics should be about so Im very comfortable doing that." "Hillarys right—she does have a lot of plans Explore them " Speaking about "mean-spirited" Republican candidates in this election Hillary reflected: "We can have differences Look Im well-aware that its a contact sport I understand that But when it gets right down to it youve got to offer Americans your credentials because its a huge interviewing and hiring process And people have to decide ?What do I know about this person? Is this the person I want in the Oval Office? Is this the person I want to be both president and Commander-in-Chief? And that requires a level of dialogue and debate that is civil that does have a purpose to it other than just you know making a point."
