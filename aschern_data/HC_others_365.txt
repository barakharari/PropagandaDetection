"I firmly believe that if you spent your life keeping the lights on for our country we cant leave you in the dark
For more than a century Americas coal miners have put their own health and safety at risk to provide affordable and reliable energy for the nation
They are entitled to the benefits they have earned and the respect they deserve
"Thats why I am proud to stand with Senator Joe Manchin and the United Mine Workers of America in calling on Congressional Republicans to stop playing politics and give the Miners Protection Act a vote before the benefits of these hardworking men and women start expiring later this year
"We also have a shared responsibility to reinvest in the coal communities that have been an engine of American economic growth
Thats why last fall I proposed a comprehensive revitalization and job creation plan including building 21st-century infrastructure and high-speed broadband repurposing abandoned minelands and power plants to support new economic activity and creating a Coal Communities Challenge Fund to support locally-driven economic development priorities in small business agriculture health care tourism housing and other industries
"And we need to invest in carbon capture and sequestration which will reduce emissions from coal and natural gas combustion and will help us meet the global climate challenge more quickly and at lower cost according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
Thats why I support Senator Heidi Heitkamp and Senator Sheldon Whitehouses Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act which Senator Kaine has also co-sponsored.
