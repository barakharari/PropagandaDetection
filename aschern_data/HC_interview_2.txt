" Thank you Madam Secretary This is a big interview for us Twenty-two years weve been doing this and this is one of our big ones I want to tell you—want to ask you about 12 questions tonight..." OK .. in two segments I hope we get through them all Thanks Chris " Back in 2001 when we had 9/11 and you were a senator from New York there was a different spirit in this country including the Republican Party You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East Its not about Muslims Its about terrorism And he did it so effectively."

And we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan Afghanistan and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet "But then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home We have to work with our friends and allies around the world
