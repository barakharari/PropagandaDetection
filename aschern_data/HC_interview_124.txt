Some breaking news now: CNN will host a Democratic debate in Flint Michigan on March 6 just two days before that states primary
Hillary Clinton is actually going to leave the campaign trail here in New Hampshire to visit Flint Michigan today
But first shes right here..
right next to me live
Secretary Clinton thanks so much for being here
Well Jake congratulations on doing the debate in Flint
Its really important we keep the spotlight on this problem
The mayor asked me to come
Theyre trying to you know really have a lot of support because we hope that there will be some good news coming out of Congress in the next few days
And its just — its an issue that I dont want people to forget about
Because its not the only Flint in our country.
There are other places where these kinds of toxins lead other sorts of pollutants are really affecting peoples lives
And Im just not going to give up on this.
 Can I ask you a question? Just a clarification of what you think needs to be done in term of the people there..
who need water and need infrastructure built
You have called for the citizens of Michigan the State of Michigan to be billed but youre also supporting this bill from senators Stabenow and Peters from Michigan that would make it a federal payment.
 Do you think that it should be a state issue in terms of the money paying for Flint or should it be a federal issue? 
It should be both and partly because theres a broad set of needs that have to be addressed
Yes the infrastructure must be repaired and modernized
Yes we do have to get emergency means in to get water get the kind of nutritional support
You know I know something about lead poisoning because of work Ive done in the past and —
With the Childrens Defense Fund?
Well and as a senator from New York
We had a lot of you know old housing with lead paint in it
A lot of kids suffered from lead poisoning
And part of the challenge is youve got to intervene early
We need comprehensive health screenings
Then we need to figure out how do we get the right nutrition and vitamins
Youve got to begin to work to counteract the lead
Then weve got to get the educational additional help that kids need
This is a big deal because its not only about fixing the infrastructure but its also about the future
How were going to take care of these kids going forward
So theres a lot of work to be done
And I think it has to be both the state and a federal responsibility.
You know whats really so upsetting is as you know just a little bit of lead can cause permanent damage.
 There is no — there is no acceptable level of lead for kids
So according to what we know now the state knew at least in February — and the federal EPA knew at least in April and yet it wasnt until months months later
So obviously this is a failing on the local level
But do you also think its a failing by the EPA?
Well I think it has to be absolutely investigated to figure out what happened
Why wasnt this sounding alarms everywhere? And I dont want to prejudge it
I dont know what the answer to that question is
Im focused on OK what do we do now? The damage has been done
How do we mitigate that damage? How do we help alleviate both intellectual and the physical lasting consequences that children face when theyve been poisoned by lead? So Im trying to look at the future
I know there will be a lot of people focusing on what happened and thats really important because we do have to you know open this inquiry more broadly
You know Ive said that weve got places in our country where we have asthma rates at 500 times higher killing you know young children of color than anybody else because of where they live and what theyre exposed to
You know our childrens health should be the highest priority for our country and so anything I can do and Ill keep doing it to really beat the drums on this but to ask people hey lets look everywhere
You know Flint — weve got to help flint
Its a terrible horrible set of circumstances.
But we also have to be looking at other places to try to make sure that this doesnt happen to other kids.
So I cant help but notice its also the New Hampshire primaries coming up in two day.
 Oh it is?    So just to move to politics for one second
Your family has a long history here
You obviously won here in 2008
Your husband staged his comeback here in 1992
Can you win here? Is it possible that you can win here? 
Im just going to work as hard as I can
I love the New Hampshire primary
I love it because the interactions you have with voters in every setting is so rewarding and voters in this state take a first second third fourth look at you
I have been telling voters across the state this is the biggest job interview in the world
Youve got to really think hard about what the job is who can be president who can be commander in chief and then you have to really judge us
And I dont know whats going to happen
I am in very good spirits about that because I love the process.
 So you said the other night at the — I forget if it was the debate or the town hall they all run together in my mind but you said one of them that nobody can point to an example where you took money from a group..
The Sanders campaign afterwards sent out an excerpt from a book from Elizabeth Warren in which she suggests that you took $140000.00 from the banking interests and as a result according to Warren not me changed your vote on the bankruptcy bill
Now I want — I would love it if you would address the substance of the allegation
And also the fact that Sanders campaign sent it out but Sanders himself backed off from making the charge himself.
thats their — thats their typical you know artistic smear
You know the campaign sends out something gets people riled up and then they say oh no were running a positive campaign
OK Im glad you raised this because I really do want to get this record straight once and for all
I worked with Senator Warren with whom I have the highest regard in 2000 to stop a very bad bankruptcy bill
And then when I got to the Senate in 2001 early on there was going to be a vote on another bankruptcy bill
I was deluged — now as a senator not as a first lady lobbying and working against this bill I was deluged by womens groups and childrens groups because the version of the bill that was going to be voted on did not protect child support did not protect vulnerable women and their children from what would happen to them if their partner their spouse went into bankruptcy and was able to discharge those obligations
And you know literally people I had worked with for 30 years came and said nobody else will do this
Youve got to help us
Weve got to change that provision
And I went to the floor
And I buttonholed the Democrats and the Republicans who were leading that bill
I said you cant do this
Youve got to change that provision
But they also put it to me
They said if we change this provision you have to vote for the bill
Now thats what happens sometimes
I didnt like the bill any more than I had liked it before
It still had very bad provision
But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children
So OK I held my nose
When it came back in 2005 I was against it
I didnt actually get to vote against it because Bill was in the hospital with another heart procedure but I put out a statement on the floor
You can look at what I said in 2001
You can look at what I said in 2005
And so Im glad to set this record straight
You know but this kind of attack by innuendo insinuation is really getting old
You know hey cant point to anything
They are grabbing at straws to make this case
But lets ask Senator Sanders campaign why did he vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives? One of the key reasons for the Lehman brothers being over leveraged collapsing and helping to bring down the economy
You know this is a debate that we should be having about what our public records are and where we stand
I have the toughest most effective campaign plan to take on the entire financial industry
I dont understand why he doesnt join me
Because it goes a lot further than anything he is proposing
We have to look at the shadow banking industry
Everybody knows where I stand on this
So I think we should end with the smear and the insinuation and talk about our respective plans.
A lot of your supporters were very upset this last week when some older male pundits suggested that you are a shouter
Now I would observe — I would observe that Bernie Sanders doesnt exactly talk in a whisper
But that said do you think that — do you think that the coverage of you is sexist? Do you think that when male pundits say things like that they have a different standard for you?
And I dont want to single anybody out Jake
Look we are still living with a double standard and I know it
Every woman I know knows it
Whether youre in the media as a woman or youre in the professions or business or politics
And I dont know anything other to do than to just keep forging through it and just taking the slings and arrows that come with being a woman in the arena
You know sometimes I talk soft
Sometimes I get passionate and I get a little bit excited
I dont know any man who doesnt do the same thing
And I find it sort of interesting that all of a sudden this is a big discussion about me once again
Im so used to this
Im going to keep making my case
Im going to keep talking about what I will do as president
Im going to keep laying out my record
Because I think its really important that this election be actually about who can do the job that needs to be done starting in January of 2017.
How has this experience of running for president changed you if it has? 
You know I think the most amazing learning experience
And having gone through this now twice I think I am a different person than I was back in 08
I think that the experience I had as secretary of state has given me a perspective and an understanding of a lot of the issues that is deep and gives me the confidence to know that I can do every part of the job
But you run at different points in a countrys you know thinking
And right now were at a time when people are on both sides Republicans Democrats right left people are really worried that our economy isnt working for them that our government isnt working for them
And thats causing a lot of the anger and the frustration
You know things have been going on that are just wrong
These Supreme Court decisions against voting rights Citizens United — those are dramatically altering the balance of power in our country
The great recession for which there were a number of causes but you have to look at the failure of the Bush administration to regulate what was going on in the financial and mortgage markets
People deserve to be upset
But what Im saying — and maybe its not the most popular theme these days
You know get angry vent but then realize anger is not a plan and venting is not a strategy and we have work to do
And Im confident we can do that work
But were going to have to roll up our sleeves and say OK weve got to make sure the economy works for everybody not just those at the top
Heres my plan for jobs and raising incomes
Weve got to make sure the Affordable Care Act gets the cost down but gets coverage to 100 percent
Heres what I can do about that
Lets have a discussion about what you would be thinking if you were conducting a job interview
OK Ive got the experience Ive got the passion
And heres what Im going to do with it
And thats what I think the country needs because people are just whipping them up
I mean on the Republican side all of this rhetoric this demagoguery which plays to the fears and the insecurities that people feel
And I just think thats not who we are
We are the premier problem-solvers of human history
Weve got to get back to doing that together.
Well see you on the campaign trail
 Thanks so much for stopping by
 Nice to talk to you
