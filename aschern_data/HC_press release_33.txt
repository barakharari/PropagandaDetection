Two fierce feminists "Hillary Clinton and Cecile Richards the president of Planned Parenthood have a lot in common: Theyre both pantsuit aficionados
Theyve both faced down hours of hostile congressional questioning
And theyre both unwavering champions of womens rightsâ€”especially a womans right to make her own health care decisions.
They recently sat down together with Refinery29 and talked about everything from "mansplaining
to the future of abortion rights and why Hillary is Planned Parenthoods presidential pick
"I took a lot of strength knowing that Secretary Clinton has been through this many many many times
Shes an inspiration to me and women all across the world.
 "As Cecile rightly said when youre standing up for whats right it makes it somewhat less burdensome to face in her case and later in my case what was a stream of hostility
I took a lot away from her testimony.
 "I do think whats important for your viewers to understand is what the U.S House of Representatives just did was pass a bill that basically said young women on Medicaid cant go to Planned Parenthood for basic preventive care
Were talking about breast cancer screenings tests for sexually transmitted infections getting your well woman visits
For many women we are the only doctor she will see this year.
?"This should not be viewed as politics as usual
Republican presidential candidates are serious
They are in many respects appealing to the most anti-woman aspects of their party and unfortunately getting a response.
 "There will never be a world without Planned Parenthood because we will never go away
We will continue to serve people and to fight for their rights to reproductive health care that frankly determine their futures.
 "I want to be that president that will say ?Forget about it
Dont waste your time; you know youre not getting past me.
