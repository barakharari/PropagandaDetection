This is a wonderful day
Wow.xa0 On a Saturday morning yet
Isnt that nice? Thank you all
And were going to have an incredible convention
Were going to have an incredible convention
And were going to get things solved and were going to do lots of wonderful things for our country most importantly.
"So Im here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign and the White House to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again.
"I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France
Weve witnessed horror beyond belief no matter where you look
And now its happening more and more
And its never going to stop.
We need in our country law and order
And if Im elected president that will happen
 I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France and we mourn their loss as a nation
"And as far as Turkey is concerned so many friends in Turkey great people amazing people
It looks like theyre resolving the difficulty but we wish them well
A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night but hopefully itll all work out.
"Now as hopefully the next president of the United States I want to refer back to whats happened over the years
The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before
After four years of Clinton who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path because I dont even think he could have made these decisions so badly she led him right down a horrible path
He didnt know what he was doing.
"Iraq Syria all into chaos
And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons
And on top of that we gave them back $150 billion and we didnt get our hostages until the end
Now were seeing unrest in Turkey a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton
You just have to look every single thing they touched has turned to horrible horrible death-defying problems.
"We also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry our manufacturing our jobs
Theyve been taken away like were babies
And were going to bring them back.
"I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans
Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice
Ive admired the work hes done especially in the state of Indiana
And Im going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.
"But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people and hes going to fight for you
He is a solid solid person
 "Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress
He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference
Hes really got the skills of a highly talented executive leading the state of Indiana to jobs growth and opportunity in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every states way by the Obama administration
And its out of control.
"Mike Pence is a man of honor character and honesty
Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption
What shes done with her e-mails what shes done with so many things and I see the ads up all the time the ads
Shes totally bought and paid for by Wall Street the special interests the lobbyists 100 percent
 "And I think that while she got away with murder in fact I think it might be her greatest accomplishment escaping the recent scandal and her lies and the loss of 33000 e-mails -- but it wasnt a loss she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime
Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what theyve done which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.
"Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing and thats OK? Didnt give them to the FBI? Didnt give them to the attorney general and thats OK? Wipes her server clean thats OK? These are crimes
And how she got away with it I think I understand it but I think a lot of people dont.
"But I do believe while she didnt pay the price she should have paid shes going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around
Shes going to pay it at the polls
 "On top of everything else Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time
Shes totally owned by Wall Street
We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism
And its not that she believes in it
The people that give her all of this money believe in it
And shell believe in whatever they want her to believe
 What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence
  Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam
You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window
You heard what he was screaming out the window
You saw it in San Bernardino
You saw it at the World Trade Center
You saw it in Orlando
How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris
You see it all over
"And Hillary is a weak person
We are the law and order candidates and were the law and order party
Were going to change things around
Theres going to be respect again for law and order
 "Hillary Clintons foreign policy helped launch ISIS
You know shes talking -- I see the ads she puts on
If I make one statement which is fine shell take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad because shes got a lot of money because its given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests
Got a lot of money.
"But I see the ads on foreign policy
Shes talking about Donald Trump doesnt have foreign policy experience
Ive been a very very very successful businessperson
I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls I said dont go into Iraq
Nobody cared because I was a businessperson
Many many calls Ive made.
I said that in Scotland and in the U.K
that was going to happen
I was the one that predicted it
And everybody said hes wrong hes wrong
President Obama said if it happens theyre going to get to the back of the line which probably is one of the reasons they lost because I consider it a win
I think it was a win for them actually because they dont want to be told what to do
And they dont want to be told that when people pour into the country they have to take them even if theyre not qualified even if they dont have paperwork even if they have no idea where they come from.
"And I said that Brexits going to happen
I said that they are going to break away
And everybody laughed at me
And the odds were 20 percent
And then when it happened she took an ad saying oh Donald Trump said this or that but Im the one that said it was going to happen
And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right
Seventy percent didnt so thats OK.
"So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy
Now I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity I have to be honest
So many people have said party unity
I want to be an outsider
I think its one of the reasons I won in landslides
This was -- in the history of the Republican Party history with 17 people running you have to understand other people ran against one two and three
We got -- I say we because Im the messenger Im a messenger -- Im doing a good job but Im a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes
Thats more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.
Thats more than Ronald Reagan who we love
Thats more than Richard Nixon
Its more than Dwight D
You know he won the Second World War in all fairness
Its more than the Bushes.
"But I mean by a lot
I dont mean by a little
But thats with 17 people
That means our message is unbelievable
And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal unbelievable people and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland where its going to be so amazing.
It was on display where we had this group of people who -- many of whom Ive known and I wont say because for party unity Ill say theyre wonderful people OK? Never Trump they said never Trump never Trump
Oh were going to win
And they got crushed immediately because people want what were saying to happen.
"Theyre tired of a country that has horrible trade deals that has no borders that has taxes that are through the roof highest taxed nation just about in the world that has regulations that dont allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and by the way speaking of destroying businesses were going to take care of the miners and were going to take care of the steelworkers
Were going to put em back to work
 "So theyre very tired of it
But I want to thank all of those people that – delegates-- that were on the different committees because boy was that something
Did we show them something
And unfortunately the vote was very late
But essentially we had 112-12
This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and were going to have a big fight
Were not going to have a fight
People agree with what weve -- they want the wall
They want these things to happen.
 "And what were doing that Im so proud of so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it
Well call it the Johnson amendment where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals because without the evangelicals I could not have won this nomination
The evangelicals have been unbelievable
I dominated with the evangelicals
A lot of people were surprised
They say hes not perfect
But you know what? They know Im going to get the job done and theyre really smart
 "And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals that were going to do something that nobodys even tried to do
You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group
And he was a powerful president
He knew how to get things done
He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him
But he was a powerful president.
"And we call it the Johnson amendment where you are just absolutely shunned if youre evangelical if you want to talk religion you lose your tax-exempt status
We put into the platform were going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment
And were going to let evangelicals were going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.
I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders Christian leaders Jewish leaders believe it or not some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office and I said why is it that youre so powerful as an individual and yet when you get out there youre sort of timid?
"And they didnt know how to answer the question
And it took two three meetings before I figured it out
One great great gentleman that everybody knows but whose name I will not reveal said Mr
Trump we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues
We live in fear that were going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything thats even slightly political.
"And I looked out the window
I was in Trump Tower and I pointed to people walking down the street
I said well they have the right to speak but you dont
That means theyre more powerful than you are
We have to do something about it
How did it start? How did it start? 
 "And they said it started because of Lyndon Johnson
And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader
And he did this and he got it done
And were going to undo it so that religious leaders in this country and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice because religions voice has been taken away
And were going to change that
So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana and I won Indiana big
Remember Indiana was going to be the firewall
Thats where Trump was going down -- they agreed Id win New York Id win Pennsylvania Id win all these places
But Indiana was going to be the firewall.
"So I got to study Indiana and I got to study New York and a lot of other places and I saw how NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton has drained our manufacturing jobs just drained us like weve never been drained before
NAFTA again signed by Bill Clinton
NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country
Manufacturing down in some states 55 60 percent
Its a horror show moving to Mexico moving to other places.
"I have a friend whos a great builder
What he builds is plants
Thats all he does is build plants
He doesnt -- he builds plants
Its the biggest in the world from what I hear.
"I said hows business? I was with him the other day
Hows business? He goes unbelievable
I said really wow Im surprised
Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country
He says Donald what were doing in Mexico you wont believe
I said what do you mean? He said were building plants in Mexico the likes of which weve never seen.
"I said what about this country? Not much
I said but Mexico? He said youve never seen anything like it
"Folks thats going to stop
Were going to go reverse it
Were going to bring our jobs back to this country
We cant be the stupid people anymore
 "And he was better than a pollster
Hes better than a consultant
I would say how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars
Me I give them $10000 OK? 
 "It costs other people millions
It costs other campaigns millions to get a report
Every time they get a report its millions
But Ill tell you what a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report
He didnt say it from the standpoint of hes upset about it
How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico
In fact he actually said Ive never ever seen anything like it.
"And if you look Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan
We want them to build them in Michigan
Theyre going to build them in Michigan
And you know that I know how to do that
"But theyre not going to do and theyre not going to take advantage of us without retribution
There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think youre going to youre your product and sell it in here
And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country
And everybody here knows what the consequences are but I wont say that because Im much more interested right now in Mike
 "Indianas unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike other than he looks very good other than hes got an incredible family incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing
Expected to go for another four years
He would have won I think very easily in Indiana
Indiana their unemployment rate has fallen
When he was there when he started 8.4 percent when he was governor when he took over to less than 5 percent in May of 2016
Since January 2013 Indianas labor force has increased by more than 186000 jobs
You have to understand Ive gone around to all these states
Ive gone to all of them
And every time I have statisticians
I say give me the stats on a state.
"And its always bad down down down
Down 40 percent 50 percent 60 percent in some cases
Heres somebody where its gone up
Private sector job growth is up by more than 147000 jobs since 2013
"Governor Pence balanced the budget
Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budgets so out of whack in this country we dont know what were doing
Were going to owe very soon $21 trillion
They dont know what that means
Governor Pence balanced the budget produced a surplus and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.
"Its also rated triple-A their bonds are rated triple-A
Very few states have that
Thats as good as you can get whether youre a company a state triple-A.
"Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business
And its not even close
There are approximately 34000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office
So you have fewer Hoosiers fewer people from Indiana.
"And besides that Bobby Knight my friend who really did help me
I mean if you want a reference Bobby Knight in Indiana we love Bobby Knight
But he agrees with everything Im saying
"Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation for veterans where nobodys fighting for the veterans like Im fighting for the veterans the veterans have been left behind
 "If you remember a few months ago Hillary Clinton said the really -- theyre doing much better the V.A
Theyre doing a much better job than people give it credit for
People are dying on line waiting for five six days for doctors
People are dying on -- they cant even see a doctor
"Take a look at whats happening with the V.A
Take a look at whats happening with -- you know just the Veterans Administration hospitals
And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine
And boy am I going to win big with the veterans
I mean we know that for a fact
 "So its now 2.4 percent for veterans
In 2013 when Mike Pence took office the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent
It was 31st in the nation one of the bad ones and now its almost the best
"Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates
Theyre going to stay there
And Mike worked hard on that
He was telling me that was not easy.
"Under Governor Pences leadership Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the states history
So youre balancing budgets and yet youre giving more money to education
Isnt that a great thing? 
 "Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America
School choice is where its at folks
You want to get your schools better you gotta get rid of Common Core fast.
"Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the states history
Were cutting taxes and balancing budgets
And along with corporate tax reform just about number one in the country
CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.
"So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets were spending more money on education and the infrastructure is kept up
That had so much -- look as a builder nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump
Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?
"You know its very interesting
Were building -- were building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue right near the White House and its an amazing -- probably the best location one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA General Services
And I really like whats happened
Were going to have an opening very soon
Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.
"But I thought the other day I was going over the numbers were under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year – but were a year ahead of schedule and were under budget substantially
And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do
 "And when I explained to a government representative that were under budget and ahead of schedule they almost fell off because theyve never heard those words before
"So when I see what happened to Indiana which was having tremendous problems when I see what happened to Indiana under Mikes work -- also his predecessor did a great job by the way great job whos now at Duke -- whos now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers the state and everything else that to me was probably the single most important point because its something that hasnt happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country.
"The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible and I learned that when I campaigned there
And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide
And I learned that when Governor Pence under tremendous pressure from establishment people endorsed somebody else but it was more of an endorsement for me if you remember
He talked about Trump then he talked about Ted -- whos a good guy by the way whos going to be speaking at the convention Ted Cruz good guy -- but he talked about Trump Ted then he went back to Trump
I said who did he endorse?
"So even though he was under pressure because Im so you know outside of the establishment it was the single greatest non-endorsement Ive ever had in my life OK? I will tell you
 So with that I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States Governor Mike Pence
