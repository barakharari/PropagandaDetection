This is why elections matter
"President Obama just made an emotional call to stop gun violence in America—and backed it up by announcing executive actions intended to curb the epidemic of violence thats taking more than 33000 American lives every year.
These are important steps that will respect the Second Amendment while working to protect our families and communities from gun violence
But theres more we have to do—and its going to require all of us to stand up and say "Enough.
That means demanding more from our elected officials
That means standing up to the gun lobby
If you want to defend President Obamas actions to help prevent gun violence from taking more American lives you have to vote in this election—because the Republicans running for president would rip away these executive actions and the progress weve made.
