"From the first days of his campaign Donald Trump has painted Mexicans asxa0rapistsxa0and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people including children and U.S
He has said we should force Mexico to pay for his giant border wall
He has said we should ban remittances to families in Mexico if Mexico doesnt pay up
What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona not Mexico and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.
