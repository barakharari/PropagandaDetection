"Were not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom
Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them and this stunt doesnt change that
If Donald Trump doesnt see that thats his loss
As always shes prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.
