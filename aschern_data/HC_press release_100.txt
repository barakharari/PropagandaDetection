These photos tell the story of Hillary for Iowa
For the last nine months the Hillary for Iowa team has been using the hashtag #ISpyIowa to document their travels across the Hawkeye State as they canvassed phone banked and organized to help Hillary Clinton win the Iowa caucus
There is nothing more beautiful than engaging with purpose organizing with heart and winning every single day
But when they were done taking in the view Team Iowa got to work—wherever they could find a spot
And when they did get an office a Hillary supporter who lived in the neighborhood helped them furnish it
"But that didnt keep them from working outside—the Iowa summer is just too beautiful for organizers to stay indoors!
Plus they had to start knocking on doors and collecting commit cards
The election was only eight months away! Thankfully thousands of people came on board to help Hillary win in Iowa
Some animals even got in on the fun! The Hillary for Iowa crew worked hard ? ?? but they played hard too
?And at some events like the Iowa State Fair they got to do both at the same time
And as the leaves began to change ? ?? and snow started falling ? ? Hillary for Iowa never lost the excitement of those summer days
"And on the night before the Iowa caucus they couldnt resist capturing one last Iowa sunset—and one last canvass.
