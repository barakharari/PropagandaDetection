"I am honored and grateful to have earned the endorsement of the Transport Workers Union of America Locals 502 505 and 250-A
"In California and all across the country the diverse members of the TWU keep our airplanes flying our trains running and our buses driving
The members of Locals 502 505 and 250-A are no exception
They keep passengers and residents alike safe healthy and moving every day
In the process theyve helped to build the American middle class
And theyve stood up and demanded the fair treatment and respect that they deserve
"As President Ill stand with the workers of Locals 502 505 and 250-A
Ill never stop fighting to protect workers rights to organize and bargain collectively
Ill fight to stop big corporations from padding their bottom lines by cutting workers wages and sacrificing health and retirement benefits
And because infrastructure is so vital to our economy in my first 100 days Ill propose the biggest investment in American infrastructure since we built the Interstate Highway System
If Im elected president organized labor will always have a champion in the White House and a seat at the table.
