"I could keep you here until tomorrow morning telling you these stories.
President Bill Clinton has been by Hillarys side since law school—and as he puts it shes the "single best changemaker
At a recent campaign stop he shared a few lesser-known stories about Hillarys ability to make things happen
When he was governor of Arkansas he put Hillary in charge of coming up with new state educational standards
She traveled to every county in the state to talk to parents and teachers and she came up with a plan to improve the public schools:  And her hard work paid off for the students of Arkansas; the state became one of the most improved school systems in the nation
 "As one of her first jobs out of law school Hillary went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund
She traveled to prisons in South Carolina to investigate why African American teenagers were being jailed as adults—and her work helped to change federal law
"When he became governor a lot of poor and rural Arkansas counties didnt have preschool or kindergarten meaning many kids werent getting off to the strongest possible start
Hillary made it her mission to change that
She came home one day and told him: 
The program was called HIPPY (Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters) and Hillary was determined to bring it to Arkansas children
 Hillary got the program started in Arkansas and soon it became a model for states across the country
 "The story is a classic example of Hillarys determination and ability to make change happen
And President Clinton has plenty more examples where that came from
She is the best qualified person for this moment in history I have ever seen
And I have studied all my predecessors
"The average person who gets elected president is intelligent hardworking and honestly tries to do what they say theyre gonna do when they get there but theres a big difference in a who can do and who cant.
"Heres what I know about Hillary
Shes the single best changemaker Ive ever met in my life and we need a changemaker not a change talker a changemaker.
"So Ill tell you a couple of stories you may not know
A court said our schools werent properly financed in Arkansas and we were going to have to reallocate the money
I put Hillary in charge of coming up with new standards; she went to every county in the state made all the people who didnt want to change mad presented it to the legislature
The crusty old head of the education committee in the legislature said it was so good that maybe we had elected the wrong member of our family
Theres something to be said for that
Nine years later I come to Iowa running for president telling you one reason you ought to vote for me is that the same guy had just given us a report saying the two most improved school systems in America were in Arkansas and South Carolina
She did that not me
She had never been elected to anything; she just always made something good happen
"She went to South Carolina to see why all these African American teenagers were being jailed as adults; 13 14 15 years old being kept for years in adult prisons
And she went back and they changed that too
She hadnt been elected to anything but she was making change
Thats just the beginning I could keep you here until tomorrow morning telling you these stories.
The country needs somebody who can actually get something done.
She comes in one day just jumping up and down happy
She said "You know Ive been so worried we have six of the 20 poorest counties in America.
She said "These kids are going to school theyre not able to learn
Theres no kindergarten theres certainly no pre-kindergarten and theres no preschool
I found a preschool program in Israel that teaches people to be their childrens first teachers even if theyre illiterate
I think it would work here.
I said "Well what are we gonna do?
She said "I did it
I called the woman who started it shell be here in 10 days and were gonna start this program.
Next thing I know Im going to these little graduations for preschoolers
Next thing you know its in 26 states its still thriving
And there are thousands of people in this country today who have learned more and grew up just because of her
And they have no clue and she didnt care and she hadnt been elected to anything
She just made something good happen.
"Youre entitled to give all these remarks the love discount if you want
But everything I have told you I believe with all my heart
Shes the best person to win the election the best person to implement the changes we need economically and socially the best person to preserve the gains weve made under President Obama
But mostly I want you to do whats best for you
Most of the people in this audience have more tomorrows than yesterdays.
Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows believe it or not spend most of our time thinking about the future
And I believe it would be a gift that would keep on giving because she made everything she ever touched better
