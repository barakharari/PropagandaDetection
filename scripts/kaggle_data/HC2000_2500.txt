For the first time, #DemPlatform explicitly calls for repealing the Hyde Amendment, which restricts women’s access to reproductive rights.
#DemPlatform says Americans should earn at least $15 an hour, citing NY’s min wage law &amp; calling for raising &amp; indexing federal min wage.
For the first time ever, #DemPlatform calls for ending mass incarceration and the school-to-prison pipeline, and tackling systemic racism.
#DemPlatform reflects issues Hillary champions, like raising wages, immigration &amp; criminal justice reform &amp; protecting reproductive rights.

This is one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Not just for those who look or love or worship one way—for all.
We need to work together to keep our country and our citizens safe. None of this will be helped by anything Trump has to offer.
People can’t board planes with full shampoo bottles—but people being watched by the FBI for terrorism can buy a gun, no questions asked?
We need a Commander-in-Chief who can grapple with our challenges in all their complexity, with real plans that actually address them.
Trump's statements are lies—but he tells them because he has to distract from the fact that he has nothing substantive to say for himself.
"He said I’ll abolish the 2nd Amendment. Wrong. He said I’ll let a flood of refugees into our country without any screening. Also wrong."
Trump's Muslim ban is wrong, dangerous, and in this instance, nonsensical. The terrorist in Orlando was born in Queens—just like Donald.
"If Donald suggests I won’t call this threat what it is, he hasn’t been listening. But I will not declare war on an entire religion."
"It matters what we do, not just what we say. It didn’t matter what we called bin Laden—it mattered that we got bin Laden." —Hillary
Americans don’t need conspiracy theories and pathological self-congratulations. We need leadership, common sense, and concrete plans.
Trump's rhetoric is shameful. It was one thing when he was a reality TV personality. It’s another when he’s running for president.
People of different faiths, backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities are coming together to say: we won’t let hate defeat us.
"I believe that despite those differences of opinion, we’re all on the same team...There’s more that unites us than divides us." —Hillary

"To all the LGBT people grieving today: you have millions of allies who will always have your back. I am one of them." —Hillary
The terrorist in Orlando targeted LGBT Americans out of hatred and bigotry. An attack on any American is an attack on all Americans.
Inflammatory anti-Muslim rhetoric hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror. It’s wrong, and it's dangerous.
Background checks and an assault weapons ban might not stop every attack—but they'll stop some, and save lives. We need to fight for them.
In Orlando and San Bernardino, terrorists used assault weapons like the AR-15 to kill Americans. We should make it harder for them to do so.
If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked.
We need to stop terrorists from getting the weapons they need to carry out attacks. https://t.co/Q6r7VVj9ds

Hey @realDonaldTrump, meet part of Hillary's policy team. We're pretty proud of her 201 pages of policy. @mpshapiro https://t.co/0eQrg3g6JC
Trump can’t say he treats women with respect. (For once, he’s right.) https://t.co/eaOpDVA8Bb
Thanks, @VP Biden! Your support is a BIG… deal. -H https://t.co/ShRoVUFocR

We’re not just going to break the glass ceiling. We’re going to break down all the barriers that hold back women and their families.
Trump has called women “pigs,” “dogs,” and “disgusting animals.” We can't even count on him to respect women—much less protect our rights.
Trump says he'd be "the best for women." Anyone who'd defund @PPFA and wipe out safe, legal abortion has no idea what’s best for women.
Laws that restrict access to abortion don’t make women less likely to seek it—they just make women less safe. https://t.co/vj4ZOeHq4V
Defending women’s health means defending access to safe, legal abortion for all who need it—not just women who can afford it.
The Hyde Amendment restricts the reproductive rights of low-income women—disproportionately women of color. We need to repeal it now.
Ever notice the politicians who oppose birth control and abortion also oppose policies that make it easier to raise a child—like paid leave?
