Fixing the mass incarceration crisis. Dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline. Helping the formerly incarcerated. It's time to act.
We must fight for criminal justice reform. Everyone is safer when there is respect for the law and when everyone is respected by the law.
"Perhaps the best way to honor our police is to follow the lead of police departments across the country who are striving to do better."
"Killing police officers is a terrible crime...anyone who kills a police officer and anyone who helps must be held accountable." —Hillary
