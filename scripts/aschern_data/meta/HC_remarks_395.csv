0,"""Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh yes",0,84
1,One down two to go,451,469
2,I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech,836,880
3,I was here 8 years ago and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back of course to Raleigh but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech,1153,1387
4,When Christine was talking I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there,1620,1700
5,And she kept saying about how she was about to cry,1997,2047
6,I was about to cry,2378,2396
7,Her story says so much not just about her but about our country,2725,2788
8,We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them get up every day do their best,3055,3185
9,Thats the basic bargain of America,3477,3511
10,And I was really proud of Christine,3845,3880
11,""" Were proud of you!"" "" Thank you",4212,4245
12,Thank you,4583,4592
13,And I think her – I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality that get-up-and-go personality is going to mean a lot to the people shes taking care of,4849,5095
14,"So Christine thank you and Godspeed."" ""Now I have to thank – I have to thank Dr",5319,5398
15,Stephen Scott the president of Wake Tech Community College all the administrators the faculty and the students of Wake Tech,5696,5819
16,Now Dr,6163,6169
17,Scott told me that the enrollments about 73000,6541,6587
18,And what a tribute to what this institution represents,6950,7004
19,And I am a huge huge supporter,7376,7406
20,I just see America differently,7800,7830
21,I think theres nothing we cant do if we make our minds up roll up our sleeves get working together support institutions like Wake Tech support people like Christine,8152,8316
22,"And thats what I intend to do."" ""Now I want to thank your mayor Mayor McFarlane",8595,8674
23,Thank you so much for being here,9035,9067
24,State Senator Dan Blue Jr,9456,9481
25,I also want to recognize Linda Coleman candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina,9828,9918
26,Linda came so close last time,10265,10294
27,And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And Ill tell you somebody else Im really excited about,10641,10758
28,That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate former State Representative Deborah Ross,11073,11161
29,I have watched – I have watched the campaign shes run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it,11480,11600
30,Ill tell you what we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina,11917,12000
31,I want to thank all the elected officials who are here and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husbands and mine somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship,12242,12470
32,"Thats former Governor Jim Hunt."" ""Now theres a lot that I want to talk about today",12717,12799
33,But let me start with this because you may or may not know,13123,13181
34,Today is National Voter Registration Day,13525,13565
35,And you see some signs people are holding,13907,13948
36,I Will Vote,14294,14305
37,Now thats not only a great sign that shows youre committed to vote but its a website,14633,14717
38,And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered,15020,15083
39,"And I hope you all will and I hope youll tell everybody that you know to do the same because we want to make sure people are registered."" ""And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina and I hope that you will because think about everything thats at stake in this election right here in North Carolina",15282,15602
40,The very mean-spirited wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state,15811,15938
41,But more than that its hurt people,16279,16313
42,It has sent a message to so many people that well youre not really wanted,16668,16741
43,Youre not really part of us,17080,17107
44,"I think the American dream is big enough for everybody."" ""The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people",17424,17590
45,Now they were pretty blatant about it,17902,17939
46,Make it harder for people of color,18316,18350
47,Make it harder for the elderly,18732,18762
48,And make it harder for the young,19127,19159
49,Now some of thats been rolled back thankfully because it was so wrong and I would argue unconstitutional,19479,19583
50,But the best way to show hey in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous vibrant debate thats what its about,19864,19983
51,But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote,20284,20342
52,Thats the way were supposed to be making decisions,20675,20725
53,"It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that."" ""Now I have won elections and I have lost elections so I know what the difference is",20999,21191
54,But Ill tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us to govern ourselves to continue to widen the circle of opportunity and that includes the opportunity to be heard to express yourself your voice and your vote,21382,21612
55,"And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote and demonstrate the importance of your vote."" ""I believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election",21812,22029
56,Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout weve ever had,22296,22381
57,Now that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future and who we are fighting for,22654,22816
58,But early information is actually quite encouraging,23129,23180
59,Were seeing spikes in early voting,23571,23605
60,And were seeing voting rates among African Americans Latinos and young people going up,23965,24051
61,"And for the first time the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote."" ""Now I would love to see that",24373,24500
62,Obviously I hope people vote for me,24817,24852
63,But I would love to see that because every election is about the future,25194,25265
64,"And honestly its more about the future of young people and children than its ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent."" ""Now last night I got a chance – I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if Im so fortunate enough to be elected as your president",25459,25783
65,And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if Im asking for your vote I should tell you what I want to do,25920,26025
66,And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together,26304,26372
67,"You see I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren."" ""And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together",26582,26832
68,You see I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren,27013,27191
69,I think about that a lot in part because I started out working for the Childrens Defense Fund,27441,27534
70,"Its always been my passion about what we can do applause to help more kids live up to their God-given potential."" ""And during this campaign people have asked me Well how did you get interested in that?And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood",27766,28032
71,She was basically abandoned by her parents sent to live with grandparents who didnt want her,28286,28378
72,By the age of 14 she was out on her own working in a home babysitting keeping house,28678,28761
73,She was basically a maid,29087,29111
74,"And when I think about my mothers own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people."" ""We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other the respect we show the kindness the love that we show",29284,29648
75,"And Im well aware thats not something you put necessarily on a campaign website but Ive been talking about it because I think weve got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other."" ""When my mother was in first grade she never had any food and her first grade teacher noticed that",29708,29997
76,In those days they just brought food a little bag of food then theyd sit in the classroom and eat it and my mother never had any food,30177,30310
77,And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her,30582,30682
78,She would say You know Dorothy I brought too much food,31006,31060
79,"Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk? And it wasnt until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year something she didnt have to do but her love for her students her recognition of a child who wasnt well taken care of meant that she stepped in."" ""And then when my mother worked as a maid she really wanted to go to high school",31228,31626
80,She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents home,31748,31867
81,And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said to her If you get up early – it sounds like Christine getting up so early,32087,32261
82,If you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school,32480,32554
83,And thats what my mother did for four years she got up early and then she literally had to run run to get to high school,32809,32929
84,It sounds harsh but not for my mom,33193,33227
85,"She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live gave her food to eat gave her the chance to go to high school."" ""So when I talk about us being stronger together Im not just talking about what our government needs to do Im talking about what each of us can do to contribute",33401,33715
86,We do need to make sure – we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top and that means weve got to make investments in more good new jobs infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs technology and innovation clean renewable energy jobs,33792,34072
87,"And weve got to do more to help small businesses because thats where most of the new jobs will come from."" ""As I said last night my dad was a small businessman",34284,34443
88,When he got out of the Navy after World War II he started this small business printing drapery fabrics and he had a print plant in Chicago,34682,34820
89,It was just – it was dark room,35102,35132
90,There was no natural light,35463,35489
91,He had two long tables and hed spread that fabric on the table and then he would take silkscreens – if youve ever seen one – and hed start at one end and hed put it down hed pour the paint in and hed take the squeegee and hed lift it up and hed go all the way down to the end of one table and then hed start on the other table and he would do that until he got the job done,35629,36002
92,And I would help him out from time to time so I knew how hard he worked,36109,36180
93,But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker,36422,36525
94,"And so he was able to do what we want to see in America keep going keep reaching move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you."" ""So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone to grow the economy to create more jobs but I also want a fairer economy because – when you work hard you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year",36638,36995
95,But if you are a minimum wage worker if you work full time minimum wage you will make $15000 a year,37116,37215
96,Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women most of them with families to support,37498,37580
97,And Ive talked to a lot of these women,37893,37931
98,"Sometimes Ill be at a café or sometimes Ill be in a store and Ill just start talking to them and they will tell me – its one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if youre open to it folks will tell you whats on their minds and their hearts."" ""So Ive met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids",38073,38472
99,So we need to raise the national minimum wage and – and we need to guarantee finally equal pay for womens work because – number one its fair,38577,38717
100,Its fair,39012,39020
101,"And if your mother your wife your sister or your daughter is working dont you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?"" And the other thing I want to do I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place",39226,39530
102,It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives,39714,39797
103,I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work,40100,40173
104,And last night at the debate one of my guests was Mark Cuban,40478,40538
105,Now Mark Cuban who is a real billionaire by the way he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business and he not only used it while the business was going but when the business was sold,40793,40995
106,He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight,41262,41350
107,"""Now thats the kind of business leadership I want to hold up because what weve seen from my opponent is someone who his own campaign manager has said builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy stiffing people – dishwashers painters plumbers architects glass installers marble installers drapery installers – across America",41568,41904
108,Some of them have come forward,42168,42198
109,You can go to our website; you can see their stories,42577,42629
110,Its heartbreaking,43031,43048
111,"And as I said last night Im really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business."" ""And in addition to making the economy fair weve got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work",43299,43564
112,Its really hard out there isnt it? And just listening to Christines story – getting up at 4:00 and studying getting kids up at 7:00 going to school going to work going to another job – thats not an uncommon story,43723,43935
113,"Weve made it really hard for a lot of people."" ""So heres what I think we need to do and its not a luxury its a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them",44086,44295
114,And Ive heard so many stories,44511,44540
115,Theyve told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses theyre under,44865,44969
116,So lets finally since every other advanced economy has already done this lets have paid family leave so that when youre sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn you can take care of your loved ones,45214,45434
117,And lets have earned sick days so that you dont lose your job because youre sick or you go to work because youre sick,45633,45750
118,And lets finally have affordable childcare which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition,46028,46146
119,I dont think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare and were going to fix that so that becomes the norm,46410,46559
120,"And then lets make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget."" ""Now tomorrow in New Hampshire Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary",46746,47070
121,And I want – I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way,47253,47330
122,"And were also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner."" ""Now how are we going to do that? Well were going to go where the money is and the money is at the top",47518,47755
123,Were going to go after millionaires billionaires and corporations,47977,48042
124,Were going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires and were going to close corporate loopholes,48383,48485
125,And I believe that we can get that done in part because youre going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so were going to have another Democratic senator,48796,48947
126,But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again – not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence,49223,49359
127,That hasnt worked out so well,49698,49727
128,Weve got to get back to first principles,50112,50152
129,Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go,50414,50636
130,"Lets be a government for the struggling the striving and the successful."" ""So Im excited about what we can do",50851,50960
131,I really am,51267,51278
132,And Im going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trumps claims,51591,51687
133,There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night,51979,52044
134,But heres a couple of things that caught my attention,52363,52416
135,He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes,52734,52822
136,In fact I think theres a strong probability he hasnt paid federal taxes a lot of years,53121,53207
137,And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution from health care to education our vets,53497,53648
138,"But he probably hasnt paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems."" ""And when I confronted him with the reasons why he wont release his tax returns – and I got to that point where I said well maybe hes paid zero – he said that makes him smart",53823,54110
139,Now if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you Bill and I have been blessed,54254,54380
140,We didnt come from millionaire families,54671,54710
141,My husbands father – his biological father died before he was born,55056,55122
142,His mother went to nursing school in order to support him,55457,55514
143,They struggled,55881,55895
144,They worked hard,56282,56298
145,And America gave him the chance to get a good education pursue his dreams end up being President,56632,56728
146,"My dad as I told you worked hard."" ""So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years",57002,57108
147,And if you look youll see that we paid the highest marginal rate,57398,57462
148,We tried to give 10 percent to charity,57789,57827
149,"Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that weve been given we should do our part."" ""The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen",58103,58317
150,I dont think Id make a big bragging point out of that,58572,58625
151,But he seemed to feel like hey it shows you how smart I am,58923,58981
152,He basically said Yeah if the housing market crashes I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money,59244,59347
153,"I got to tell you what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question."" ""And he made it very clear that he didnt prepare for that debate",59541,59810
154,At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared,60020,60115
155,But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort,60395,60476
156,And I said Yeah,60796,60811
157,You know what? I did prepare,61151,61179
158,And Ill tell you something else I prepared for,61515,61561
159,"I prepared to be president of the United States and I think thats good."" ""So as I said in the beginning we have two different visions here",61851,61989
160,I believe we are stronger together,62287,62321
161,That is at the core of what Ive done over my years in advocacy and public service,62654,62735
162,I believe that America is already great and it is our responsibility to make it even greater,63040,63132
163,I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone we also need to keep our country safe and we need to provide strong steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners,63390,63577
164,Ive laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues,63836,63915
165,Ive laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS,64262,64316
166,And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent,64675,64734
167,"Its unclear exactly what he is saying."" But words matter",65089,65145
168,"And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia ""Hey were not sure were going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty."" Words matter",65420,65610
169,People here that and they start to doubt Americas word Americas intention,65876,65949
170,I felt like I had to jump in and say I just want to be clear,66255,66315
171,We will honor our treaties,66634,66660
172,We will support our allies and our partners,66997,67040
173,"""This is not reality TV",67370,67393
174,This is real,67751,67763
175,Its as real as it gets,68107,68129
176,so were going to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top,68454,68534
177,Were going to keep America safe provide strong steady leadership and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other,68821,68997
178,Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night are they? Theres still a lot we dont know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte but this we do know: Weve got to bring communities together,69223,69442
179,We have to listen to each other,69709,69740
180,"We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect and respect for the law from the communities that are protected."" ""And weve got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many too many lives in our country",69981,70281
181,Again I think we can come together,70509,70543
182,A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks,70888,70993
183,They believe in the Second Amendment as I do,71323,71367
184,They believe in the right of individuals to have guns as I do,71707,71768
185,"But they believe along with me that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people and make it so easy to get them."" ""So theres work to do",71998,72187
186,But its great work,72442,72460
187,Its important work starting right here in North Carolina,72802,72858
188,We have 42 days left,73203,73223
189,This elections going to be close,73574,73606
190,They all are these days,73949,73972
191,Thats why every call you make every door you knock on every friend you register to vote to make the difference,74288,74398
192,I want you if you can to text join j-o-i-n to 47246 or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina,74663,74790

194,"Thank you for coming."" ""So remember here in North Carolina starting on October 20th you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county",75381,75562

196,Its the governors race the lieutenant governors race the U.S,76276,76336
197,Senate race and other races up and down the ticket,76680,76730
198,Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election,77063,77128
199,Were not fearful,77480,77496
200,We dont want to build walls,77853,77880
201,We want to build bridges,78221,78245
