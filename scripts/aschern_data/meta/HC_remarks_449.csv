18,So I want you to know – now I just have to say I know Im preaching to the choir,7074,7153
19,But I also through you want to talk to people who are still making up their minds believe it or not right? Because weve got a choice between a president who will bring us together keep our country safe get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top – or someone whos temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job,7318,7658
20,You know Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse mislead and discourage the American people,7860,7953
21,I mean hes such a downer right? And its time for him to stop fear mongering stop distracting from whats really at stake and frankly stop disgracing our democracy,8252,8413
22,"We cant let him get away with this.n"" ""But heres the good news",8703,8765
23,Yes America is great and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals,9103,9192
24,But we are seeing Americans coming together – Democrats Republicans independents – to reject Donald Trumps dark and divisive vision of our country,9488,9634
25,And its going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days whats at stake,9932,10041

31,But I want you to know the energy were now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what were against its also about what were for,12375,12509

50,Get young people to stay home,19918,19947
51,Get people of color to stay home,20302,20334
52,Get the LGBT committee to say home,20678,20712

57,And heres some really good news,22714,22745
58,This is amazing,23135,23150
59,More than 20 million people have already voted in this election most of those votes in the last few days 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida,23459,23615
60,Now you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in,23871,23965

64,And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election listen to this,25410,25503
65,Weve heard some outrageous things in this campaign,25820,25870
66,Im sure well hear more in the next nine days,26220,26264
67,"But I got to tell you I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.n"" ""But yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning",26551,26747
68,It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York,27019,27151
69,Now let me say this is important in part to remember,27445,27497
70,This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS,27838,27886
71,So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school and all the kids and their families for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine,28164,28346
72,Because you know back in the 90s some of you remember,28652,28705
73,"Right? Children werent welcomed in school.n"" ""And then unannounced and uninvited guess who barges in? Donald Trump",29034,29148
74,He walks right up to the stage,29494,29524
75,He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation,29855,29954
76,None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there,30237,30301
77,He wasnt a donor at all,30612,30635
78,He had never given a single dollar to help build the school,30964,31023
79,He just wanted people to think he had,31341,31378
80,So he sat on the stage through the program even posed for photographs and when it was over he got up and walked out,31667,31782
81,No explanation,32093,32107
82,No donation,32474,32485
83,"Now really who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well Ill tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.n"" Back in 1997 he was principal for a day at a public school",32700,33020
84,That was a program we used to have in New York,33195,33241
85,The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament,33537,33616
86,They were $5000 short,33933,33954
87,He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill,34277,34340
88,At first the kids and their parents were excited,34663,34711
89,Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke,35042,35090
90,So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine,35419,35476
91,Now this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trumps behavior called the school and donated the $5000,35780,35919
92,"And the coach remembers this woman saying ""I am ashamed to be the same species as this man.""n ""Now I got to say any of you see the debates? Well you know I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job",36095,36375
93,Right? But a lot of what weve heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern,36566,36639
94,And heres what the Washington Post concludes,36959,37003
95,For as long as he has been rich and famous he has wanted people to believe he is generous,37328,37417
96,He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public even nationally televised promises to give his own money away,37709,37884
97,It was in large part a façade,38219,38248
98,"And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other peoples giving as his own.n"" ""Now of course because hes refused to release his tax returns we dont even know if hes ever given anything",38502,38777
99,But heres what we do know,39028,39053
100,With Donald its always Donald Trump first and everyone else last,39404,39468
101,He abuses his power,39826,39845
102,"He games the system and he doesnt care whos left holding the bag.n"" ""And heres what else we know",40185,40281
103,Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights,40613,40662
104,And this election will determine whether we continue the progress weve made or let it be ripped away,41010,41110
105,We know Trump has promised hell appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obamas executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination,41415,41615
106,And just this week a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees,41904,41998
107,Its a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trumps golf courses,42312,42377
108,"So I want you just to think.n"" ""This guy works hard",42690,42741
109,Works with his hands,43086,43106
110,Probably there 12 hours a day maybe more when its the summer season,43455,43522
111,After he told his coworkers he was gay they started harassing him,43839,43904
112,They called him names,44240,44261
113,They even threw rocks and golf balls at him,44602,44645
114,It got so bad he ended up in the hospital,44969,45010
115,Now his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing,45321,45371
116,So finally he went to the police for help,45684,45725
117,He was too scared even to come back to work,46035,46078
118,"And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.n"" ""Now this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels",46373,46485
119,For starters its a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day,46787,46920
120,And its deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior Trumps business punished the victim for coming forward,47244,47389
121,"Now if thats how Donald Trump runs his business what does it say about how he would run our country? Weve made a lot of progress on LGBT rights but as that story reminds us we still have work ahead dont we?n"" ""There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday post your Facebook photos on Sunday and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love",47427,48005
122,So heres what Ill do as president,48089,48122
123,We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act,48469,48522
124,And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives,48839,48937
125,Well work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach,49302,49381
126,And we will take on homelessness bullying and violence particularly youth homelessness which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids,49764,49891
127,And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy,50261,50337
128,LGBT kids dont need to be cured of anything,50723,50766
129,They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected,51149,51205
