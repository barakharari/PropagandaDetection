""The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media",8859,9214

34,People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything,14839,14919
35,And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine the New York Times and other media outlets as part of a concerted coordinated and vicious attack,15167,15369
36,"It is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine – including 2000 more emails this morning ""These claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false – and the Clinton Machine knows it is",15508,15878
37,Its all fabricated,16143,16161

41,These lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited,17900,17993

43,"""Whats happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine – and that magazine should be put out of business."" Six months ago the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me and the central witness they used said the story was false that she was quoted inaccurately",18649,18993
44,She said I was a great guy and never made those remarks,19196,19251
45,We demanded a retraction but they refused to print it – just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things,19508,19716
46,That story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times,19966,20031
47,It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them,20365,20425
48,Now today the same two discredited writers who should have been fired from the times tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago – another ridiculous tale no witnesses no nothing,20685,20926
49,"""Also a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary",21173,21273
50,The story was lovely but last night we hear after 12 years a new claim that I made inappropriate advances,21574,21679
51,I ask a very simple question why wasnt it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year,21905,22099
52,Take a look at her words,22345,22369
53,It would have been the headline,22737,22768
54,"No it only appears 26 days before the election."" This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony – the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false",23067,23268
55,This weekend the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years,23498,23706
56,But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them,23994,24062
57,Others have likewise were presented with this story but after seeing the evidence we provided refused to print it,24376,24489
58,"""This is part of a concerted effort led by the New York Times which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival and which probably wont even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook has become more and more vicious and vile."" I will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people",24639,25059
59,But let me state this as clearly as I can,25233,25274
60,These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies,25628,25697

62,We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime – indeed one the most important elections in modern history – and the polls show us in a dead heat,26392,26568
63,And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead,26837,26887
64,So now the Clinton Machine has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met worked with and employed – in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense,27112,27350
65,Again this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government,27556,27694
66,When I declared my candidacy I knew what bad shape our country was in,27998,28067
67,I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics,28389,28474
68,I knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones,28761,28843
69,I knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me,29129,29180
70,But I take all of these slings and arrows for you,29484,29533
71,I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back,29840,29905
72,Our great civilization here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning,30204,30309
73,"""Weve seen it in the United Kingdom where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty.""

75,Their political resources are unlimited,31698,31737
76,Their media resources are unlimited,32200,32235
77,And most importantly the depths of their immorality is unlimited,32671,32735
78,Our political establishment has no soul,33158,33197
79,I knew these false attacks would come,33612,33649
80,I knew this day would arrive,34056,34084
81,And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve,34438,34525
82,The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you,34839,34902
83,The only force strong enough to save this country is you,35252,35308
84,The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you the American People,35659,35753
85,They control the Department of Justice and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States – in the back of her airplane while on the runway – for 39 minutes – to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton,35957,36315
86,"""Likewise they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what hes done to one of our great institutions",36456,36681
87,"Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings and far more – and yet he let her off the hook while others lives are being destroyed for far less."" This is a conspiracy against you the American people",36831,37109
88,This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization,37327,37393
89,"""I didnt need to do this",37738,37762
90,I built a great company and I had a wonderful life,38121,38171
91,I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies deceptions and malicious attacks,38470,38652
92,"Im doing it because this country has given me so much and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back."" Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell",38883,39049
93,But they are wrong it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people,39277,39362
94,"""In my former life I was an insider as much as anybody else – and I know whats like to be an insider",39615,39715
95,Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam,39976,40068
96,Because I used to be part of the club Im the only one who can fix it,40346,40414
97,"Im doing this for the people and this movement is just right – and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again."" The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise",40633,40864
98,They know that if we win their power is gone and returned to you,41126,41190
99,The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted and replaced with a bright future – but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future or whether we let the American people decide our future,41438,41656
100,If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work then no other highly successful person – which is what our country needs – will ever again run for this office,41876,42045
101,I will not lie to you,42340,42361
102,These false attacks hurt,42721,42745
