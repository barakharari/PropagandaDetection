35,"She went into the little office and asked for an application and they said ""Oh we dont have any apartments."" She said ""But I saw the advertisement."" ""Well we have no apartments left.""n Well she thought that was pretty peculiar and so she decided to do a little investigation and she found out that all of her African- American friends who had gone to that apartment run by Donald Trump and his father Fred had been told there were no apartments.n So she had the gumption to go and make a complaint which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination",13570,14134
36,"They settled the suit but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating.n So when you hear as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination take it seriously my friends because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election.n ""And I was also very very grateful",14047,14460

57,That much is certain,22389,22409
58,"The question is what kind of change are we going to see? Are we going to build a stronger fairer better America or are we going to fear each other and fear our future?n"" ""I want you just to imagine imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon whos elected on January 20th because by imagining it I want you to think about every issue you care about everything that is dear to you everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie.n"" ""Its hard for me to imagine that we would have a president who has demeaned women mocked the disabled insulted African-Americans and Latinos pitted people against each other instead of bringing them together",22471,23145

67,These were five black and Latino kids some as young as 14 who were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York City back in 1990,26316,26450

69,Nearly three decades later they were exonerated by DNA evidence.n And in addition someone else confessed to the crime so they were finally released from prison,27147,27306
70,"But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions he actually said ""They should still be in prison."" Evidence didnt matter",27565,27750
71,The law didnt matter,28051,28071

85,It is wrong my friends that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same offenses.n When I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015 the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform,33534,33834
86,I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign we must end the era of mass incarceration.n Too many families have been broken up too many communities have been so badly affected,33974,34164
87,We have to reform these mandatory minimums and sentencing,34461,34518
88,We have to ban the box so people who have served their time can get a real chance at a good job and a fresh start.n And we have to restore trust between police and communities,34789,34964
89,"We are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law.n ""This is important of course to families and communities but it is important to all of us",35171,35354

94,"We have to take steps to reduce gun violence and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well.n ""And weve got to make investments in those communities that are struggling especially communities of color.n"" ""When I was in eastern North Carolina today and I was talking to people there who had been devastated by Hurricane Matthew people who didnt have very much to start with who lost everything farmers with 100 200 acres growing sweet potatoes wiped out",36953,37504
