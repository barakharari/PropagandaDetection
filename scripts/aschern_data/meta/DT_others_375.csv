0,So its been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference,2,79
1,And you as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports should ask yourselves why,497,585
2,And Ill tell you why,1003,1023
3,"Because despite the nice platitudes shes been a mess."" ""You look at whats happened with ISIS which isnt even mentioned",1396,1514
4,You look at whats happening with law and order they dont even mention our police,1840,1920
5,They mention everybody but our police,2278,2315
6,"They dont have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags one that we saw."" ""So you know I put myself through your news conferences often not that its fun",2578,2801
7,235 days no news conference for Hillary Clinton,3065,3112
8,"You oughta check it out because theres a lot going on."" Her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her Debbie Wasserman Schultz she totally rigged it",3426,3594
9,Bernie Sanders never had a chance,3916,3949
10,"""And total disloyalty its like youre fired get out fast",4312,4367
11,The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation both very serious,4729,4805
12,"What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible absolutely horrible."" ""If I wouldve used language like they used about religion about race about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I wouldve had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race."" ""With her everythings just fine",5040,5340
13,So just ask yourself why she doesnt have news conferences,5580,5637
14,"And honestly the reason is because theres no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad."" ""When they talk about change I noticed they have change",5931,6101
15,Shes been there for 30 years,6390,6418
16,Thirty years,6768,6780
17,Theres no change,7146,7162
18,Its going to be the same its going to be an extension of Obama,7490,7552
19,"In my opinion worse."" ""She lied about TPP",7867,7908
20,"She was for TPP she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because its a horror show its going to kill all our jobs its going to be almost as bad as NAFTA maybe worse which her husband signed by the way which destroyed this country destroyed manufacturing in the United States."" ""And Ill do something about it thatll be so renegotiated",8089,8434
21,And by the way yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements,8641,8735
22,First time yesterday,9124,9144
23,"Well because of me."" ""She also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation",9505,9611
24,"And she heard it and she said wow she cant win that subject in a debate."" ""So all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now hes going against it",9838,10053
25,"And Bernie Sanders was right he was against it."" ""They will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesnt",10213,10415
26,"They will vote it in—just mark my words hopefully we dont have to worry about it—but she will vote."" ""Shell change a comma shell change a paragraph of the 6000 page document that nobodys even read on our side",10583,10791
27,"Just so you understand the other countries know every word every paragraph every sentence every single comma and period."" ""We dont even read it our country",11036,11191
28,Because were led by stupid people,11524,11557
29,"so she saw me talking about TPP she realized that she couldnt defend it her special interests are pushing her hard because shes bought and sold by the special interests."" ""Theyre pushing her very hard and so she said shes against it",11841,12073
30,The day she gets in—which hopefully will never happen—she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP,12346,12442
31,"And that will be another disaster for job in our country OK?"" ""So why dont we start off any questions? Yes sir?"" ",12748,12860
32,"  """,13198,13199
33,Its just a total deflection this whole thing with Russia,13569,13625
34,In fact I saw her campaign manager I dont know his title Mook,13954,14015
35,"I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking."" ""By the way they hacked—they probably have her 33000 e-mails",14312,14446
36,I hope they do,14770,14784
37,They probably have her 33000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because youd see some beauties there,15126,15225
38,"So lets see."" ""But I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked",15521,15618
39,Now first of all was what was said on those thats so bad but he said I watched it,15880,15961
40,I think he was live,16266,16285
41,"But he said we think it was Russia that hacked."" And then he said—and this is in person sitting and watching television as Ive been doing—and then he said could be Trump yeah yeah",16557,16736
42,Trump Trump oh yeah Trump,17026,17051
43,"He reminded me of John Lovitz for ""Saturday Night Live"" in the liar where hed go yes yes I went to Harvard Harvard yes yes",17350,17472
44,This is the guy you have to see it,17753,17787
45,Yes it could be Trump yes yes,18103,18132
46,So it is so farfetched,18458,18480
47,Its so ridiculous,18814,18831
48,Honestly I wish I had that power,19164,19196
49,Id love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country,19508,19576
50,"""And thats why—if it is Russia nobody even knows this its probably China or it could be somebody sitting in his bed",19859,19974
51,But it shows how weak we are it shows how disrespected we are,20282,20343
52,Total—assuming its Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors its a total sign of disrespect for our country,20652,20779
53,Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader,21075,21207
54,So I know nothing about it,21523,21549
