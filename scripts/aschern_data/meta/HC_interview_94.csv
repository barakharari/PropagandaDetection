0, Thank you for joining us Madam Secretary,0,40
1,"  Lets talk about that ""Des Moines Register"" — that ""Des Moines Register"" poll that has you in the lead — eight years ago your hopes were dashed by that surge of new voters for Barack Obama",444,631
2,"Are you confident that wont happen again? "" Well George heres what Im confident about",961,1046
3,Weve run a terrific campaign from the grassroots up,1385,1436
4,I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign,1775,1860
5,And were going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night,2173,2282
6,Of course its close,2616,2635
7,Its competitive,3023,3038
8,"Thats why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night."" "" You did have that surprise on Friday; the State Department saying they will not release 22 emails of yours deemed top secret",3322,3551
9,You want them released,3827,3849
10,"Why are you so confident that release would not compromise national security? What do you know about those emails that we dont?"" "" Well heres what I know",4167,4320
11,I know that this is I think a continuation of the story that has been playing out for months,4591,4683
12,There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me,4998,5078
13,Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee whos had a chance to review them has said that this email chain did not originate with me and that there were no classification markings,5363,5565
14,So I do want them released and of course I cant be clear about exactly what the reasons might be for some in the government as part of this interagency dispute to make this request not to make them public,5763,5967
15,But I would like to see them disclosed and I think they can,6215,6274
16,"It should be disclosed —""    Your supporters — "" — that Im told about them."" "" — your supporters including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack former governor of Iowa and Senator Feinstein herself has suggested its political",6551,6770
17,"Is that what you think?"" "" Well its — Im going to leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on",7015,7151
18,I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning,7386,7486
19,And I just want this matter resolved,7781,7817
20,"The best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago release these let the public see them and lets move on."" "" You know youve said many times that the emails were not marked classified",8069,8258
21,No evidence that thats not true,8541,8572
22,But the non-disclosure agreement you signed as secretary of state said that that really is not that relevant,8926,9034
23,"It says classified information is marked or unmarked classified and that all of your training to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference."" "" Well of course",9331,9507
24,And thats exactly what I did,9840,9868
25,I take classified information very seriously,10269,10313
26,You know you cant get information off the classified system in the State Department to put onto an unclassified system no matter what that system is,10648,10796
27,We were very specific about that and you — when you receive information of course there has to be some markings some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case,11026,11244
28,The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what Im told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report,11433,11645
29,That seems a little hard to understand that we would be retroactively over classifying a public newspaper article,11913,12026
30,So lets just get it out,12373,12396
31,Lets see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions,12757,12831
32,This is very much like Benghazi George,13176,13214
33,You know the Republicans are going to continue to use it beat up on me,13557,13627
34,I understand that,13979,13996
35,Thats the way they are,14384,14406
36,"But after 11 hours of testimony answering every single question in public which I have requested for many months I think its pretty clear theyre grasping at straws and this will turn out —""    Finally on this matter you know a few months back you told my colleague David Mir it was a mistake to set up this private server",14644,14962
37,Yet just this Monday you said there was no error in judgment,15150,15210
38,"How do you square those two statements? "" Well look as Ive said many times it was permitted",15513,15604
39,My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice,15922,15971
40,It was not the best choice,16320,16346
41,I wouldnt be here talking to you about it,16697,16738
42,Id be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds,17013,17179
43,"And be you know really able to answer their questions as I have been now for so many months.""  You and Senator Sanders really going at it right now",17405,17551
44,And here was — he was on the stump there yesterday saying this about your attack,17813,17893
45,"  "" Dont tell me that Im defending or protecting the gun lobby",18215,18275
46,Dont tell me Im attacking Planned Parenthood,18607,18651
47,Those are inaccuracies,19018,19040
48,"And we can do better than that.""   "" Hes calling you on this says he got a D- rating from the NRA and 100 percent record with Planned Parenthood."" "" Well let me tell you what the people who work on these issues every day have said",19307,19535
49,They say Im the leader,19778,19800
50,Im the leader who has taken on tough issues,20168,20211
51,Ive taken on difficult issues like Planned Parenthood the gun lobby for many years,20542,20624
52,And they concluded to endorse me by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund,20953,21023
53,I was very honored to have that,21373,21404
54,Thats not saying that others havent voted with them,21768,21819
55,But they were looking for a leader and they found it with me,22162,22222
56,Ive been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames Iowa endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly because they believe Im the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby the same with the Human Rights Campaign,22459,22724
57,They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community,22939,23039
58,Now that is just the facts,23364,23390
59,People who have known us people who have evaluated us people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me,23696,23831
60,"And Im very proud of that.""  You know you just mentioned  "" hitting you with the email issue",24117,24207
61,Theyre clearly going to hit Bernie Sanders with the fact that hes a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination,24513,24627
62,Some of your supporters concerned about that Senator Claire McCaskill are saying they cant wait to run an ad with a hammer and a sickle,24916,25051
63,Steny Hoyer Congressman Steny Hoyer saying he calls himself a socialist,25374,25445
64,I dont think thats a good title to be running for President of the United States,25775,25855
65,"Is that what you think? Will the fact that hes a Democratic socialist make it harder for Democrats to win in November?"" "" Well that certainly is what a lot of Democratic leaders are saying",26115,26303
66,And I take them at their word,26586,26615
67,They know their states,26980,27002
68,They know the country,27381,27402
69,They know we have to take back the Senate,27757,27798
70,They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country,28106,28215
71,Heres what I think,28534,28552
72,I think Ive been subjected as you know so well to years of scrutiny and Im still standing talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that,28835,29005
73,And its a very tough gantlet to run,29270,29305
74,And if there are issues that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic theyre going to use it,29586,29729
75,I feel vetted,30027,30040
76,I feel ready,30410,30422
77,"I feel strong and I think Im the best person to be the nominee and to defeat whoever they nominate in November."" "" Finally I wonder what your response to this quote from your old friend Robert Rice Secretary of Labor under President Clinton",30683,30923
78,He said youre the most qualified candidate for the political system we now have,31186,31265
79,But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have,31602,31698
80,"How do you respond to that?"" "" Well look Im a progressive who thinks its important to actually make progress",32017,32125
81,Thats what Ive done my entire life,32456,32490
82,Thats what I will do as president,32850,32883
83,Obviously I have big goals,33244,33270
84,I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top,33594,33704
85,Get incomes rising get women equal pay raise the minimum wage have a renaissance in manufacturing move toward clean renewable energy — I have big goals,33978,34129
86,And I tell you how Im going to get there and how Im going to pay for them,34389,34462
87,And I think that is what the Americans want,34766,34809
88,Im not going to sit here and overpromise and under-deliver,35117,35175
89,Im going to tell you what I know we can achieve and thats going to take the political system we have right now and then I intend to bring in more people as always have George,35432,35606
90,When I ran for Senate the first time you remember you know people didnt give me much of a chance,35836,35932
91,I won and then when I was reelected I won with a bigger percentage,36217,36283
92,And then when I was Secretary of State even the Republicans said I was doing a good job,36575,36662
93,So I understand politics,37011,37035
94,I understand a campaign,37422,37445
95,I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel theyve been left out and left behind,37768,37941
96,"I think I know how to do that and I think the voters know that I know how to do that.""  Secretary Clinton thanks for joining us this morning",38230,38369
97, Great to talk to you George,38777,38804
98,Thank you,39212,39221
99, And we will be right back with Bernie Sanders,39629,39674
