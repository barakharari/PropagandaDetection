35,As I see it there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead,14553,14713
36,These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree,14997,15064
37,And they are all critical to our future,15425,15464

51,And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats,21215,21294
52,Take the threat posed by North Korea – perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States,21581,21791
53,When I was Secretary of State we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us,21967,22243
54,The technology is ours,22504,22526
55,Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships,22896,22941

64,"Good luck enjoy yourself folks.xa0I wonder if he even realizes hes talking about nuclear war."" Yes our friends need to contribute their fair share",26499,26645
65,I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene – and a number of them have increased their defense spending,26934,27057

70,"It takes patience persistence and an eye on the long game – but its worth it."" Take the nuclear agreement with Iran",29027,29142
71,When President Obama took office Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb,29456,29526
72,Some called for military action,29904,29935
73,But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict,30293,30402
74,President Obama chose a different path,30758,30796
75,And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions,31173,31246
76,We brought Iran to the table,31616,31644
77,We began talks,32040,32054
78,And eventually we reached an agreement that should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon,32421,32521
79,"""Now we must enforce that deal vigorously",32891,32932
80,And as Ive said many times before our approach must bexa0distrust and verify.xa0The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary including with military action to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon,33256,33491
81,In particular Israels security is non-negotiable,33835,33883
82,"Theyre our closest ally in the region and we have a moral obligation to defend them."" ""But there is no question that the world and the United States we are safer now than we were before this agreement",34181,34381
83,"And we accomplished it without firing a single shot dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harms way."" ""Donald Trump says we shouldnt have done the deal",34601,34777
84,We should have walked away,35108,35134
85,But that would have meant no more global sanctions and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us,35482,35597
86,"So then what? War? Telling the world good luck you deal with Iran?"" ""Of course Trump doesnt have answers to those questions",35899,36022
87,Donald Trump doesnt know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program,36350,36424
88,Ask him,36792,36799
89,"Itll become very clear very quickly."" ""Theres no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal."" But it doesnt work like that in world affairs",37128,37292
90,"Just like being interviewed on the same episode of ""60 Minutes"" as Putin was is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin",37549,37678
91,"""So the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels",37970,38079
92,"We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table – bragging mocking composing nasty tweets – Im willing to bet hes writing a few right now."" ""But those tools wont do the trick",38343,38524
93,"Rather than solving global crises he would create new ones."" ""He has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind",38726,38930
94,In fact he is downright contemptuous of that work,39228,39277
95,"And that means hes much more likely to end up leading us into conflict."" Fourth we need to be firm but wise with our rivals",39611,39734
96,"""Countries like Russia and China often work against us",40067,40121
97,Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets,40504,40544
98,That hurts American workers,40944,40971
99,Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine right on NATOs doorstep,41346,41424
100,Now Ive gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China and many other different leaders around the world,41763,41858
101,"So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must and find common ground when we can."" ""Thats how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles and with China to increase pressure on North Korea",42075,42327
102,"Its how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change which Trump now wants to rip up."" The key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements",42507,42771
103,"""Donald doesnt see the complexity",43049,43082
104,He wants to start a trade war with China,43455,43495
105,And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too,43836,43923
106,But a trade war is something very different,44261,44304
107,We went down that road in the 1930s,44648,44683
108,It made the Great Depression longer and more painful,45028,45080
109,"Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt and its not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis."" ""And I have to say I dont understand Donalds bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America",45321,45591
110,He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength,45854,45932
111,He saidxa0Youve got to give Kim Jong Un creditxa0for taking over North Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat including his own uncle which Donald described gleefully like he was recapping an action movie,46206,46437
112,"And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader hed give him an A."" ""Now Ill leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants."" ""I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who Americas real friends are",46611,46846
113,Because it matters,47119,47137
114,"If you dont know exactly who youre dealing with men like Putin will eat your lunch."" Fifth we need a real plan for confronting terrorists",47483,47620
115,"""As we saw six months ago in San Bernardino the threat is real and urgent",47909,47982
116,"Over the past year Ive laid out my plans for defeating ISIS."" ""We need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground",48245,48466
117,We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syrias civil war and close Iraqs sectarian divide because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive,48715,48853
118,We need to lash up with our allies and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money arms propaganda and fighters to the terrorists,49155,49350
119,"We need to win the battle in cyberspace."" And of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home",49642,49745
120,That – in a nutshell – is my plan for defeating ISIS,50057,50109
121,"""Whats Trumps? Well he wont say",50430,50461
122,He is literally keeping it a secret,50802,50837
123,"The secret of course is he has no idea what hed do to stop ISIS."" ""Just look at the few things hes actually said on the subject."" ""Hes actually said – and I quote –maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.xa0Oh okay – let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East."" Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS",50990,51389
124,He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS which would mean mass civilian casualties,51532,51636
125,"""Its clear he doesnt have a clue what hes talking about",51963,52018
126,So we cant be certain which of these things he would do,52349,52404
127,But we can be certain that hes capable of doing any or all of them,52725,52791
128,Letting ISIS run wild,53138,53159
129,Launching a nuclear attack,53549,53575
130,Starting a ground war,53960,53981
131,"These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge."" ""And through all his loose talk theres one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS",54308,54493
132,His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesnt just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on,54773,54913
133,Its also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS,55236,55279
134,"And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight."" A Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS",55625,55743
135,We cannot take that risk,56114,56138
136,"""This isnt reality television – this is actual reality."" And defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans",56480,56656
137,It takes a real plan real experience and real leadership,56979,57035
138,Donald Trump lacks all three,57423,57451
139,And one more thing,57868,57886
140,A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy,58236,58385
141,Our troops give their all,58757,58782
142,They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that,59198,59246
143,"""Ive worked side-by-side with admirals and generals and visited our troops in theaters of war",59634,59727
144,Ive fought for better health care for our National Guard better services for our veterans and more support for our Gold Star families,60058,60191
145,"We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trumps hands."" Sixth we need to stay true to our values",60458,60585
146,"""Trump says over and over againxa0The world is laughing at us.xa0Hes been sayingxa0this for decades he didnt just start this year."" ""He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987 when Ronald Reagan was President saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us",60780,61105
147,"He was wrong then and hes wrong now – and youve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America and has felt that way for at least 30 years wants to be our President."" ""The truth is theres not a country in the world that can rival us",61192,61458
148,Its not just that we have the greatest military or that our economy is larger more durable more entrepreneurial than any in the world,61635,61768
149,"Its also that Americans work harder dream bigger – and we never ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place."" ""So it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values",62009,62228
150,It matters when he says hell order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists,62500,62594
151,During the raid to kill bin Laden when every second counted our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety,62896,63036
152,"Donald Trump may not get it but thats what honor looks like."" And it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people calls women pigsproposes banning an entire religion from our country or plays coy with white supremacists",63258,63482
153,America stands up to countries that treat women like animals or people of different races religions or ethnicities as less human,63761,63889
154,What happens to the moral example we set – for the world and for our own children – if our President engages in bigotry? And by the way Mr,64170,64308
155,Trump – every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces,64567,64718
156,Donald Trump Donald Trump could learn something from them,65043,65100
157,That brings me to the final point I want to make today – the temperament it takesto be Commander-in-Chief,65494,65599
158,"""Every President faces hard choices every day with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives",65963,66063
159,"Thats the job."" A revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region an adversary reaches out for the first time in years – what do you do? ""Making the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts",66356,66571
160,It takes a willingness to listen to other peoples points of view with a truly open mind,66800,66887
161,"It also takes humility – knowing you dont know everything – because if youre convinced youre always right youll never ask yourself the hard questions."" ""I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama debating the potential Bin Laden operation",67149,67404
162,The Presidents advisors were divided,67742,67778
163,The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive,68212,68267
164,The risks of failure were daunting,68694,68728
165,The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan,69128,69222

""I have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision",70693,71043
170,This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride,71230,71304
171,"Were all counting on that."" ""Because making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake",71641,71748
172,It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure,72067,72206
173,It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory,72504,72583
174,"And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that were fearful not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us instead of shaping our own destiny."" ""Thats not the America I know and love."" ""So yes we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure",72787,73070
175,And we need to do better by American families and American workers – and we will,73258,73338
