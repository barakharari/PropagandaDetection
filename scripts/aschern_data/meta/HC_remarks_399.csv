0,"""Thank you! Thank you all so much",0,33
1,Wow! I am so happy to be back here in Iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you,388,472
2,And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction,827,887
3,And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today,1203,1279
4,I remember so well when I met her back in 2015 and I saw that sign,1577,1643
5,And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated,1933,2023
6,And when I saw Janelles sign it just made me think about my friend and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already,2270,2429
7,And we just clicked,2703,2722
8,And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her,3006,3109
9,And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa,3363,3440
10,So the circle is completed and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other,3720,3815
11,"""Now before I came out I had the great great privilege of saying hello to someone Ruline Steininger who is – is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay",4062,4228
12,There she is,4520,4532
13,Hello Ruline! Hello Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913,4864,4963
14,I am so grateful for her support and I dont know if any of you have seen the videos both about Janelle and about Ruline,5234,5353
15,But I really do recommend that you see them both,5641,5689
16,Ruline talks about this long active life that shes had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world,5995,6109
17,And I think its important to have that perspective,6422,6472
18,So its a great honor to have Ruline supporting me,6804,6853
19,I am so pleased,7207,7222
20,"And shes going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts."" ""I want to thank Dr",7548,7636
21,Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party fighting so hard to elect Democrats,7947,8034
22,And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate Patty Judge,8361,8436
23,Wheres Patty? Pattys out there fighting hard every single day and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate,8717,8854
24,And Jim Mowrer the 3rd District congressional candidate,9169,9224
25,Jim is running a great campaign and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington,9564,9657
26,"But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa."" ""Now while were meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding",9908,10161
27,I talked with the mayor,10433,10456
28,I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so,10807,10883
29,They hope that they will not have the flooding,11226,11272
30,They took a lot of good precautionary measures,11624,11670
31,Our campaign along with thousands of people came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding,11982,12095
32,"And I told them that if Im so fortunate enough as to be president were going to have a big infrastructure program and were going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids."" ""Now I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey",12272,12580
33,Thats very personal to me,12794,12819
34,I live in New York,13177,13195
35,People commute into New York from New Jersey,13543,13587
36,We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died,13927,13980
37,I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because its a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage,14260,14399
38,"So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today."" ""Now we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today",14586,14796
39,And we have what 40 days 39 days left,15015,15052
40,And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path,15325,15426
41,We have 40 days to win an election thats going to affect the next 40 years of our country,15674,15763
42,"And you every one of you can make the difference in this election."" ""Now how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well weve got a bunch of active Iowans here",16013,16175
43,Are you ready to go to the polls? Well luckily in Iowa you can start today,16435,16509
44,Lots of folks dont have that opportunity across the country,16833,16892
45,And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites,17200,17307
46,Weve got one right down the street,17616,17650
47,So when you finish here you can go vote,17990,18029
48,"And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa."" ""Any of you see that debate on Monday night? Well one down two to go",18294,18414
49,Well I have to tell you it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something not just against somebody,18607,18843
50,And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago fighting for kids and families because its been the cause of my life,19045,19184
51,It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America,19433,19564
52,"And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work their talent will take them."" ""Now you may have heard me say this",19773,19985
53,I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa,20209,20293
54,But I was very fortunate,20617,20641
55,None of us picks our parents,20998,21026
56,But I really was fortunate,21382,21408
57,My dad was a Navy veteran a small businessman and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security a good solid middle class life,21698,21861
58,And I know how hard he worked because occasionally Id go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies,22128,22247
59,And it was not a very big building,22560,22594
60,It didnt have any natural life,22938,22968
61,There were no windows in it,23316,23343
62,"Its what he could afford."" ""And there were two long tables",23690,23748
63,And hed roll out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen,24080,24143
64,Any of you ever seen a silkscreen an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here theres a wonderful t-shirt store,24466,24579
65,Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing,24904,24968
66,So he would take that silkscreen and hed put it down and he would pour the paint in,25289,25372
67,Then hed take a squeegee and hed go across it,25667,25712
68,And then hed lift it up and hed go all the way down the table,25994,26055
69,And if there was going to be more than one color hed do it all over again,26315,26388
70,"And then when he finished he would gather it up and put it in his car and hed go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it."" ""Thats how I was raised to think about doing business",26605,26787
71,You do your best,27051,27067
72,You enter into a contract or an agreement,27398,27439
73,Somebody orders your goods or your services,27771,27814
74,And then they pay you for it,28160,28188
75,Right? And as I said the other night one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy,28436,28638
76,Her words,28893,28902
77,And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts to pay what had been bargained for,29214,29330
78,"I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldnt have survived all that."" ""All that work and then to be told were not going to pay you or maybe well pay you 10 cents on the dollar or 20 cents? Thats just wrong",29532,29791
79,What kind of person does that takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? Weve been looking into the records and theres a long list of people who have been mistreated,29940,30162
80,I just dont believe thats the way were supposed to treat each other in America,30433,30511
81,"And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country."" ""Now my mom had a very different story",30797,30927
82,My dads father was a factory worker but they had a strong family,31213,31277
83,My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents and they didnt want her,31567,31666
84,So she was out on her own by the age of 14,31949,31991
85,She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter,32298,32345
86,And it may sound harsh but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other,32585,32754
87,"So for her it was a gift."" ""And then she got another gift",32990,33047
88,The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school,33330,33399
89,And so the woman said If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school you can go to high school,33636,33785
90,But youll have to come right back,34046,34079
91,That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old but for my mother it made all the difference,34382,34465
92,And thats exactly what she did for four years and most days she had to run – run – to get there,34733,34828
93,"But she didnt care because she wanted to get an education."" ""So when I learned more about my moms life I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families and especially for kids whove been left out or left behind in some way",35004,35247
94,"Thats why I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law and boy every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career."" ""So thats been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy – because I think we have three big issues facing us",35222,35800
95,Number one we need an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership in accordance with our values,35806,36019
96,And we need to bring our country together,36279,36320
97,"We have to heal these divides."" ""But when I think about the economy yes I want more new good jobs with rising in-comes",36629,36747
98,I see my friends from the laborers here,37052,37091
99,We need to do work that builds our roads our bridges our ports our airports our tunnels our water systems our sewer systems,37400,37523
100,This is good honorable work and boy do we have a lot of it in America,37807,37876
101,We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents – and sometimes even great-grandparents – made,38189,38307
102,If were going to have a competitive economy we need to be building America again,38617,38697
103,And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing,39059,39109
104,And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa,39459,39562
105,I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that Ive seen anywhere in the country,39869,39974
106,And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers and as designers using 3-D printing,40226,40408
107,I was so impressed,40688,40706
108,And I think we need to do that across America,41058,41103
109,And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools,41441,41506
110,"It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools."" ""Another way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what youve done with clean renewable energy",41797,41974
111,Now it wasnt a partisan issue in Iowa,42282,42319
112,It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor Tom Vilsack,42673,42746
113,But its been continued over the years,43112,43149
114,And look at the results,43527,43550
115,Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources most particularly wind,43898,43999
116,Right? And look at the number of jobs – its nearly 10000 jobs now that are related to that,44314,44404
117,Plus the renewable fuel standard which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material,44736,44885
118,"I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future and Im excited by that."" ""Im running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese",45190,45377
119,I know its real,45686,45701
120,I believe in science,46103,46123
121,But Ill tell you what else is real,46512,46546
122,Whats real are the economic opportunities the new jobs and businesses were going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that,46827,47049
123,Now we also need to help small businesses,47330,47371
124,Iowa is filled with small businesses,47738,47774
125,It should be easier to start one it shouldnt be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations,48099,48206
126,Were going to try to streamline that process,48545,48589
127,Being the daughter of a small businessperson I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands,48902,49027
128,And were going to work hard,49357,49384
129,"I want to be a first-class small business president in honor of my dad and Im going to do everything I can to help you get started and grow small businesses."" ""But while were growing the economy we need to make it fairer",49642,49862
130,And here are a couple of things I want to do,50100,50144
131,Lets raise the national minimum wage so people who work full-time are not still in poverty,50455,50545
132,Ive met – you know two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women – and Ive met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America,50797,50948
133,Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15000 at the end of a full-time year of work,51193,51339
134,"We also could give the biggest boost to incomes and particularly family incomes if we finally guaranteed equal pay for womens work."" ""And the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing so if you helped to create the profits all of you not just the top executives will be able to share in those profits",51514,51846
135,You know at the debate the other night one of my well-known supporters Mark Cuban was there in the front row,52028,52136
136,And he really I think unsettled my opponent,52466,52509
137,But Ill tell you Mark Cubans a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing and not only while the business is ongoing but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold he shared the profits with all of his employees,52795,53024
138,"300 employees became millionaires because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company all together."" ""And the final point I want to make about this is about family economics",53222,53444
139,You know lets tackle the cost of childcare,53709,53751
140,Between 2000 and 2012 childcare costs went up 25 percent,54120,54176
141,Incomes barely budged right? So were going to increase federal investment and provide more tax relief to working families so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare,54477,54681
142,Now if you dont have small children or grandchildren right now you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities,54902,55094
143,"A lot of families are just so stressed out."" ""The other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies and provide paid family leave so you can take care of your family members",55285,55504
144,Now a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies adopted babies and of course thats a big part of it,55734,55850
145,Last year in Newton a mom said to me Im counting on you to know what its like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work,56077,56223
146,"Right?"" ""Thats a lot of you",56466,56493
147,There you are,56815,56828
148,Okay,57161,57165
149,And Ive got to tell you I hear that all over,57479,57523
150,When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter I was talking to one of the nurses and I said so what is your biggest worry? She said well my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work,57724,57969
151,Right back to work,58179,58197
152,But its not just for babies,58549,58576
153,Its for sick children sick spouses elderly members of your family who are having health problems,58898,58994
154,There is nothing more important than caring for each other,59317,59375
155,"And I will tell you it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families."" The other big expense for family economics is education",59703,59838
156,Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools no matter what zip code they live in right? And we also have to make college affordable,60098,60250
157,Yesterday in New Hampshire I was with my friend and my former opponent Senator Bernie Sanders,60540,60633
158,I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran,60941,60994
159,It was a campaign about issues not insults,61328,61370
160,And we shared a lot of the same goals even though we have different ways of getting there,61670,61759
161,And so after it was over he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together,62014,62126
162,And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125000 or less,62382,62477
163,And to make it debt-free for everybody else so that you only pay what you can afford to pay without going into debt,62755,62870
164,"""Now right now Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans",63171,63256
165,An education should give you a boost not hold you back,63584,63638
166,And were going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt,63973,64041
167,We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America 300000 of them right here in Iowa,64348,64448
168,Were going to help you refinance,64757,64789
169,It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent a car payment at 2 percent and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8 10 12 percent interest on their student loans,65053,65231
170,Ill tell you what,65497,65514
171,"I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations."" ""And college is crucial but this is not said often enough",65806,65985
172,Four-year college is not and should not be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life,66245,66349
173,So were going to have real apprenticeships not the kind where youre told youre fired but the kind where youre told youre hired,66631,66757
174,"Were going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill."" ""So Im excited about what we can do together",67021,67160
175,I know so much of this campaign has been about you know whatever my opponent says and who he attacks and who he derides and denigrates,67407,67541
176,And the list is long,67836,67856
177,But its not about that,68195,68217
178,Its about you,68570,68583
179,Its about your families and your futures and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job,68890,68999
180,Now I have this old-fashioned idea,69282,69316
181,Im asking for your vote,69648,69671
182,I should tell you what Im going to do what my plans are,69993,70048
183,So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book,70360,70426
184,And I see somebody holding one in the front row,70751,70798
185,Its called not surprisingly Stronger Together,71134,71179
186,You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport wherever they sell paperbacks,71507,71584
187,And you can see what were trying to do and where were going to get the money to pay for it,71873,71963
188,"And the simple answer to that is were going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America."" ""Now my friends my opponent has a very different vision for America",72201,72399
189,He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes maybe not paying any taxes at all,72658,72780
190,And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America,73049,73149
191,Calling us a third world country,73468,73500
192,Saying our military is a disaster,73861,73894
193,That everything about America is in bad shape,74246,74291
194,But then its probably true he hasnt paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military or our vets or our schools or our roads or our education systems,74592,74755
195,He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes,75028,75098
196,"He says that makes him smart."" ""Well Ill tell you what if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public",75332,75532
197,You can go and look at them and you can see that weve been blessed and were grateful for that,75730,75823
198,"But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates and we are glad we could because we have both benefited from this great country of ours and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that."" ""Donald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9",76009,76306
199,Think about that,76535,76551
200,Five million families lost their homes,76907,76945
201,And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it,77276,77342
202,He even said that it is just business,77673,77710
203,"Well what kind of person believes that – that throwing people out of their homes foreclosing on them destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well Ill tell you thats a person who should never be president because they dont understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it."" ""So look I think after – Thank you",77925,78276
204,I think after what we saw Monday night well have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare,78438,78538
205,I have no idea what hes going to say the next time,78810,78860
206,"But you know I will spend some time preparing for it."" ""But we cant do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help",79101,79269
207,The future of our country the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot,79500,79603
208,It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited divisive bigoted things that are being said in our country,79894,80000
209,We can have our differences for heaven sakes,80329,80373
210,Were Americans; thats in our DNA,80733,80765
