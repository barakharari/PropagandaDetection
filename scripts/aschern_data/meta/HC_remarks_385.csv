4,There are now reports of a suspect in custody but we must remain vigilant,1617,1690
5,This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world,2003,2110
6,"""Im here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really much more than that they are part of our future – the kind of country we want to have the kind of people we want to be and particularly what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America",2291,2596
7,I have a proud Owl on my staff Jamira Burley,2790,2834
8,A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia,3159,3274
9,She loves Temple and we love her,3606,3638
10,"And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction."" ""Jamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future",3960,4096
11,Your generation is the most inclusive progressive and entrepreneurial that weve ever seen,4392,4481
12,And as you heard when Lauren was in college she saw challenges facing students of color but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus – so she started one,4774,4975
13,"And Lauren remains committed and engaged working with an organization called Generation Progress because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades."" ""Now I know that with so much negativity out there it is really easy to get cynical – especially about our politics",5184,5500
14,I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War,5721,5805
15,It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothings ever going to change,6113,6210

17,You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years,6885,6944

21,Answers not anger,8522,8539
22,Ideas not insults,8956,8973
23,Bridges not walls,9389,9406
24,Youre also here because you know this election isnt a reality TV show,9791,9860
25,"It shouldnt be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news."" ""This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America",10182,10357
26,I believe its wrong to tear each down,10669,10706
27,We should be lifting each other up,11071,11105
28,Its wrong to let income inequality get even worse,11454,11503
29,We have to make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top,11827,11898
30,And its wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war,12199,12272
31,"We should work with our allies to keep us safe."" It comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country or are we going to be as I know we can stronger together? ""I know what I believe and Im going to close my campaign the same way I started my career – fighting for kids and young people and families",12429,12786
32,That has been the cause of my life,12963,12997
33,And it will be the passion of my presidency and I hope youll join me,13313,13381
34,We cant get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus,13678,13764
35,My husband has a saying about that,14088,14122
36,"He calls it majoring in the minors – getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesnt matter you forget whats really important to your future and to the future of this country."" ""Take the challenges facing young Americans today",14399,14620
37,First of all if youre willing to work hard you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world,14826,14983
38,But thats been out of reach for too many young people – trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,15181,15332
39,Thats why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs,15582,15693
40,"We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country."" Next getting an education should give you a boost not hold you back",15879,16228
41,But as you know better than most tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up,16425,16519
42,I understand that Temple was founded to democratize diversify and widen the reach of higher education,16832,16933
43,That is still a vital goal,17284,17310
44,"""So I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan",17687,17729
45,We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone,18064,18173
46,And if you already have debt we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so youre never on the hook for more than you can afford,18424,18585
47,"You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com."" ""And heres something we dont talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America",18754,19008
48,People should be able to learn a skill practice a trade and making a good living because of that,19245,19341
49,"So were offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board – for welders machinists health technicians coders and so many other fields."" ""Another challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in todays economy",19519,19909
50,Families look different today than they did decades ago I think we can all agree,20095,20175
51,Most need two incomes just to get by,20529,20565
52,"And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules or they have to cobble together part-time work all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country."" ""Thats why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality affordable childcare preschool and paid family leave",20822,21174
53,"We fundamentally believe – the more we can strengthen families the stronger we will be as a nation."" ""Everywhere I go young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today",21344,21566

55,You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all,22251,22332
56,We see as Lauren said too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home,22562,22842
57,"And more than previous generations you understand that all these challenges are intersecting and we must take them on together."" ""But you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like weve never seen before in any campaign",23007,23264
58,Hate speech being normalized,23560,23588
59,The dog whistles are out in the open,23966,24002
60,And yet despite this I remain convinced Americas best days are ahead of us,24357,24431
61,"In large part thats because of the inspiring young people I meet every day."" ""Im inspired by Astrid",24740,24839
62,I met her in Las Vegas last summer,25150,25184
63,She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll a cross and the dress she was wearing,25476,25600
64,Now shes in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform,25895,26012
65,"We should all join her in this."" ""Im inspired by Mikey who I met in New York",26333,26409
66,Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense,26748,26809
67,After he got out Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people whove done their time to find good jobs and opportunities,27107,27229
68,But he persisted and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York – and I can recommend its delicious,27499,27610
69,"We have to do more to help others get that second chance including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system."" ""Im inspired by Erica one of the bravest young women Ive ever met",27848,28043
70,Her mother Dawn was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students,28318,28412
71,Erica was devastated,28769,28789
72,But then she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms,29129,29208
73,Its been painful for her – a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful – but Erica wont give up,29478,29593
74,"As she said What if everyone who faced tough odds said its hard so Im going to walk away? Thats not the type of world I want to live in."" ""Thats the spirit that makes this country great – we might get knocked down but we get right back up again",29760,30004
75,And we refuse to quit no matter what,30224,30260
76,"And thats the spirit we need in this election too."" ""Now I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm",30524,30751
77,I also know that even if youre totally opposed to Donald Trump you may still have some questions about me,30998,31103
78,I get that,31433,31443
79,"And I want to do my best to answer those questions."" ""When it comes to public service the service part has always easier for me than the public part",31741,31889
80,I will never be the showman my opponent is – and you know what thats okay with me,32137,32218
81,And its also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy like the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal,32457,32603
82,But thats because its not a detail for you,32858,32900
83,Its a big deal,33227,33241
84,"And it should be a big deal to your president."" ""So heres what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing",33535,33665
85,Hold us accountable for our ideas both of us,33935,33979

90,"Weve got a book called Stronger Together."" But let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president",35618,35824
91,I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice activism and public service,36041,36200
92,"""The first woman is my mother",36491,36520
93,Her name was Dorothy and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl,36844,36917
94,She ended up out on her own at 14 working as a housemaid,37220,37276
95,When I learned about this many years later I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm loving person and not become bitter and broken,37543,37679
96,And heres what she said one word: kindness,37970,38012
97,She was saved by the kindness of others,38346,38385
98,Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share,38696,38784
99,The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone,39069,39155
100,We have to look out for each other and lift each other up,39448,39505
101,"She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can."" ""That mission guides me still today",39711,39926
102,"When I stumble it helps pick me up because theres always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open especially kids."" When I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported it hit me right in the gut",40048,40330
103,I knew how hard-working her parents were,40559,40599
104,I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life,40934,41009
105,When I met a little boy in Flint Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder,41281,41434
106,Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America,41703,41783
107,"""The second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman",42117,42184
108,She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar,42499,42601
109,She was an ally of Dr,42949,42970
110,King and Robert Kennedy and the founder of the Childrens Defense Fund an altogether remarkable person,43308,43409
111,One day during my first semester in law school I saw a flyer – we used to have those flyers on a campus bulletin board,43695,43813
112,And Marian was coming to give a lecture,44120,44159
113,I made sure to be there and what I heard was captivating,44492,44548
114,Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families,44856,45001
115,Something just clicked in my brain,45332,45366
116,I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others Id learned from my mother my church into real social change,45683,45812
117,I went up to her and I said Could I work for you this summer? She said Sure but I cant pay you,46054,46148
118,I said Well I am paying my way through law school so I have to get paid,46390,46461
119,She said Well if you can figure out how to get paid you can have a job,46707,46777
120,"So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her."" ""After graduation I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm but I went to work for Marian at the Childrens Defense Fund instead",46987,47210
121,She sent me door to door in New Bedford Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then,47423,47569
122,And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house,47840,47928
123,She told me how badly she wanted an education but it just didnt seem possible,48215,48292
124,My heart went out to her and I wanted to help,48601,48646
125,But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough,48977,49035
126,That wouldnt force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education,49351,49463
127,I learned that to drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws,49788,49865
128,So we gathered evidence,50251,50274
129,We built a coalition,50692,50712
130,And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities,51093,51195
131,"And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families."" ""I went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies",51501,51729
132,In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies,52036,52097
133,In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it,52444,52569
134,When Bill was elected President a lot of people were surprised and even threatened by the idea of an activist as First Lady,52863,52986
135,But I wasnt about to quit then either,53315,53352
136,"I fought for universal health care and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program which covers eight million kids today."" ""The third woman who changed my life was named Sophia the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City",53614,53929
137,It was the late 1990s and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate and I kept telling them no,54124,54235
138,After all no First Lady had ever done anything like that,54531,54587
139,I myself hadnt run for anything since student council,54917,54970
140,Id always been an advocate not a politician,55315,55358
141,But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King,55672,55783
142,Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said Dare to compete,56082,56148
143,Before my speech Sophia introduced me,56484,56521
144,She was tall and as we shook hands she bent over and whispered in my ear Dare to compete Mrs,56847,56939
145,Clinton,57273,57280
146,Dare to compete,57651,57666
147,Once again something just clicked,58028,58061
148,For years I had been telling young women to step up,58400,58451
149,Participate,58803,58814
150,Go for what you believe in,59184,59210
151,"Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?"" ""Well it was a difficult transition becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race",59478,59662
152,Even all these years later I confess I dont enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians like talking about myself,59894,60034
153,But I took that leap then for the same reason Im running now to even the odds for those whove got the odds stacked against them especially children and families,60284,60444
154,And Ive learned that in a democracy if you want to help the greatest number of people you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out,60674,60831
155,We need activists and advocates entrepreneurs and innovators teachers and mentors people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways,61099,61238
156,"We also need strong principled leaders who can win votes write laws allocate resources and do the slow hard business of governing."" ""Now of course politics can be discouraging",61539,61714
157,This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes,62059,62127
158,But it matters,62554,62568

161,Our most cherished values are at stake,63883,63921
162,Every election is important from school board to state senate to president,64308,64382
163,But this time is different,64779,64805
164,We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses who retweets white supremacists who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President and hes still lying about it today,65135,65361
165,He refuses to apologize to President Obama his family and the American people,65659,65736
166,We have to stand up to this hate,66083,66115
167,"We cannot let it go on."" ""And when we do that we send a clear message: America is better than this",66421,66519
168,America is better than Donald Trump,66822,66857
