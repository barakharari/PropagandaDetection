0,"""Hello Kent State! And Happy Halloween everybody! Its great to be back in Ohio – even if even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere.n"" I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction and for his service to our nation",0,255
1,I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote,564,647
2,I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program,971,1032
3,"In particular let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown such a great senator my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan State Representative John Boccieri State Representative Kathleen Clyde and let me thank the Kent Clarks the acapella group that sang during the pre-program!n ""My friends we are about to enter the final week of this election so I wanted to come back to Ohio one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country to talk about whats at stake in this election",1204,1697
4,But let me start with this,1858,1884
5,Im sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go,2127,2319
6,"Thats a good question!n"" ""And first of all for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email I understand and as Ive said Im not making excuses",2519,2677
7,I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means they should look at them,2887,3037
8,And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year,3263,3369
9,There is no case here,3659,3680
10,"And they said it wasnt even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this.n"" ""Now what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America",3921,4169
11,And did any of you see the debates? Well I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country,4362,4523
12,And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said,4774,4849
13,I am running against a man who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons,5152,5240
14,He actually said Then why are we making them? And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons,5557,5654
15,Japan South Korea even Saudi Arabia,6013,6048
16,"Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East.n"" ""And if youre telling yourself hell surround himself with smart people wholl stop these crazy ideas remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy Donald Trump said he didnt need to consult because he said and I quote I have a very good brain",6303,6627
17,He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do,6831,6884
18,No he does not,7244,7258
19,"And of course the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putins allies.n"" ""So in these last days lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future",7517,7826
20,I started saying last June I believe that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief,8035,8193
21,And Ive got to tell you I did not take any pleasure in saying that,8517,8583
22,I have known I have known for years now people who ran for President Republicans and Democrats,8928,9022
23,And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats but I never doubted their fitness to serve,9336,9444
24,Donald Trump is different,9801,9826
25,"Thats as serious as it gets.n"" So today I want to talk about our national security",10189,10271
26,Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions,10564,10729
27,And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election,11026,11112
28,"And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?n ""Well start with nuclear weapons",11317,11655
29,Now I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering but I dont think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair,11808,11976
30,When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should and I quote not have his finger on the button then this is a topic that cant be avoided,12203,12377
31,And as Ive said Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons,12665,12760
32,He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that cant be stopped,13016,13226
33,"And when a few more countries go nuclear their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well.n"" ""One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Irans nuclear weapons program",13331,13672
34,But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother Donald Trump,13834,13915
35,"Good luck enjoy yourselves folks was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia.n"" I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people",14197,14377
36,"These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.n ""To talk so casually so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling",14629,14823
37,President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared and this is a quote from President Reagan some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us,14983,15294
38,"That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age.n"" ""So what would he think about Donald Trump who says he wants to be and I quote unpredictable about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And heres the thing with nuclear weapons – as Bruce told you when the President gives the order thats it",15336,15704
39,Theres no veto for Congress no veto by the Joint Chiefs,15908,15963
40,The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire,16308,16360
41,And that can take as little as four minutes,16711,16754
42,"Thats why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal.n"" ""Earlier you heard from one of them Bruce Blair and his story is worth remembering",17029,17249
43,In 1973 Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana,17518,17604
44,His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order,17913,18001
45,Then one night in October as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war,18258,18458
46,Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty,18738,18894
47,They unlocked the safe took out the launch codes and the keys and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them,19160,19343
48,Then they waited for the final order from the President,19641,19696
49,Thankfully it never came,20069,20093
50,But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump and sees his hair-trigger temper and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night,20424,20561
51,"As Ive said many times a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.n"" ""And that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? Weve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation",20717,21028
52,When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter,21254,21302
53,When hes challenged in a debate,21664,21695
54,When he sees a protestor at a rally,22058,22093
55,When hes confronted with his own words,22459,22497
56,So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,22862,22916
57,Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesnt want to hear racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet,23204,23401
58,"And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.n"" ""Now thankfully hes never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country",23630,23834
59,But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself,24099,24197
60,Donald is a New Yorker and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruzs attacks in a debate,24485,24614
61,And then he invoked the days after 9/11 when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other,24892,24997
62,And I couldnt agree more,25328,25352
63,Thats why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11,25686,25763
64,After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell he called in to a New York TV station,26057,26154
65,And even on that horrible day when thousands of people lost their lives he couldnt stop himself from pointing out that now because the towers had fallen a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan,26396,26607
66,"What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? Ill tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief.n"" ""For me I take this very personally my friends",26796,26995
67,Because I was one of New Yorks senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11,27243,27315
68,He and I were on the ground the very next day meeting with the Governor the Mayor emergency officials,27622,27723
69,And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero,28039,28087
70,The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see,28423,28469
71,Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers,28789,28904
72,They had all lost friends,29220,29245
73,"In a makeshift command center we were briefed on the damage and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe.n"" ""Thats what I did for eight years as a senator",29441,29742
74,I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed,29916,30035
75,And I think its important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that,30316,30401
76,Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted,30708,30778
77,They happen,31117,31128
78,Ill tell you a quick story,31484,31510
79,It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration,31836,31932
80,And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room,32239,32328
81,And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side,32602,32734
82,"And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration.n"" So even before we were sworn in to do our jobs we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision",32973,33205
83,It really matters what your experience has what your values are whether you can be counted on to make that decision,33445,33560
84,You learn a lot about people in moments like that,33871,33920
85,"And as I sat there with the pressure on having to think through in my own head how we evaluated this intelligence how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington.n ""We made the decision to go forward obviously",34159,34446
86,Some of you might have been there,34717,34750
87,But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there,35055,35216
88,"So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice keep a level head and make the right call? Because thats the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief.n"" ""Now lets get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us",35365,35664
89,Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question,35857,35963
90,If you got it on an exam I think youd be able to answer it,36254,36312
91,But apparently its hard for Donald,36655,36689
92,He has picked fights with our friends,37046,37083
93,I mean the President of Mexico the British prime minister the German chancellor pretty much the entire nation of Japan… and he even picked a fight with the Pope,37381,37541
94,And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership,37792,37957
95,He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square,38287,38371
96,"Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia.n"" ""He has called NATO quote obsolete",38740,38855
97,Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world,39209,39285
98,And its based on something called Article V which says An attack on one is an attack on all,39602,39693
99,And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11,39990,40082
100,We still have NATO allies fighting side by side working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan,40370,40474
101,They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden,40796,40848
102,"Now were supposed to tell them we wont have their back?n"" ""And by the way—right now our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe",41156,41329
103,Theyre hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere,41644,41764
104,And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops they share the risks and burdens,42151,42269
105,"Now theyre moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression.n"" ""Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City – hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe",42563,42823
106,And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail,43027,43157
107,But maybe thats the point,43467,43492
108,"Because whats most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider – is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.n"" ""As former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it and I quote her We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States",43734,44114
109,Michael Morell who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here has said that Putin is manipulating Donald,44278,44390
110,Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB,44693,44749
111,He knows he can use flattery to get into Donalds head -- to make Donald the Kremlins puppet,45062,45153
112,"And It seems to be working.n"" ""Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants from Ukraine to Syria and beyond",45431,45568
113,Hes even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama,45880,45941
114,And it gets worse,46340,46357
115,The U.S,46787,46794
116,"intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government which means Putin is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election.n"" ""So ask yourself why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him or the fact that hes promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still wont release his tax returns and dont hold your breath we dont know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing.n"" ""And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country",46850,47618
117,A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election,47648,47713
118,That should scare everyone Democrat Republican and Independent,48134,48196
119,With the election just eight days away this cant wait any longer,48611,48675
120,Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates,49052,49158
121,"The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election.n"" ""When you step back and take it all in its no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump because he would be – in their words – the most reckless President in American history",49327,49719
122,Its no surprise that not a single former President Secretary of State or Defense or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him,49859,50003
123,"Its no surprise that Bob Gates who served eight presidents over 50 years Democrats and Republicans alike has said Trump is and I quote beyond repair… stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government… temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform… unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.n"" ""I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election",50130,50617
124,Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country our children and our grandchildren,50741,50864
125,And who is best to do that,51155,51181
126,So make no mistake that really is what is on the ballot this year,51491,51556
127,Its not just my name and Donald Trumps name,51873,51916
128,Its our future,52271,52285
129,Our security,52654,52666
130,Our values,53043,53053
131,"Its who we are as a country.n"" ""Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart",53378,53499
132,But the good news is: Theres another vision for America,53821,53876
133,Instead of dark and divisive its hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified,54237,54318
134,And it is big-hearted not small-minded,54687,54725
135,Its about lifting people up not tearing each other down,55109,55164

137,That is Democrats Republicans and Independents,55948,55994

139,An America where veterans are honored parents are supported and workers are paid fairly … an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong…,56787,56942

144,It turns out if you dig deep enough through all the mud of politics eventually you hit something hard and true,58887,58997
