12,Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today,4921,5003
13,We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding,5301,5447
14,And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected,5759,5814
15,Weve got to be really focused on what were going to do with this extreme weather,6133,6213

21,You know I think you said the farm you went to this morning G.K,8574,8637
22,was 200 acres,8991,9004
23,You know thats a lot of land but thats not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm,9358,9436
24,"And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big giant farms and not enough taking care of the smaller farms the family-owned farms farms that have been in peoples families for generations.n"" ""And I will do my very best working with G.K",9677,9946
25,and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it,10194,10292

31,I dont know -- 15000 16000 people,12535,12568

37,So last night was very special on lots of fronts,14772,14820
38,And who knows? Maybe well see even more history made in a few days,15119,15185
39,You know the last time the Cubs won women couldnt vote,15488,15542

46,"And then are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?n"" You know did any of you -- any of you see those debates? Well you know I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.n But you know he kept saying things like ""Well you know what have you done for 30 years?"" Well we know what hes done for 30 years starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.n I chose a different path",17951,18502
47,I have spent my career fighting for kids and families,18618,18671
48,And I helped to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program as first lady,19027,19102
49,That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year,19427,19484
50,And I have to tell you I know it doesnt make headlines,19816,19870
51,"Its not going to you know get a big Twitter war going but when I travel around and shake hands like Ill do after my remarks and somebody says to me ""The Childrens Health Insurance Program saved my sons life."" I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf",20070,20344
52,"And the doctor said ""You know shes never ever going to be able to talk; shes not ever going to be able to hear."" Her mother who is determined began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments",20487,20711
53,But they were expensive,20988,21011
54,She didnt know what she was going to do,21389,21428
55,"And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said ""I just heard about this new program the childrens health insurance program",21766,21901
56,"Maybe you can qualify for that.""n ""Because its really for families that arent poor but dont have much money and a lot of families isnt it",22173,22310
57,"And families that dont have an employer that provides health insurance self employed independent contractors.n"" ""So the mom found out about this thing call the childrens health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter",22547,22818
58,I met that young woman and she said hello to me and she talked to me,23063,23131
59,She just graduated from college right here in North Carolina,23449,23509

61,"When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.n"" As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it",24099,24347

63,Thats another thing I meet people all over who were there and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there,24917,25052
64,"And as your Secretary of State I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and womens right and LGBT rights around the world.n"" And everything Ive done its because Ive been listening to people and again I know thats not very exciting",25249,25553
65,I plead to that,25812,25827
66,"You spend time listening not talking you know what are the poor journalists going to say ""Uh there Hillary Clinton was listening again"" right?n ""But Ill tell you it is what motivates me to hear peoples stories to hear the tribulations and triumphs",26104,26351
67,You get good ideas,26649,26667
68,Bring people together; find common ground even with people we disagree with,27035,27110
69,I disagree with people on lots of issues but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other and try to find common that common ground,27388,27565
70,And that will enable us to get results for people,27823,27872
71,"And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President Ill be.n"" ""And from the first day of this campaign Ive been telling you what I want to do",28137,28289

73,I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for not just someone to vote against,28900,28999
74,And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear,29291,29354
75,The positives and the negatives because one way or the other come this January America is going to have a new President,29629,29748
76,"And it will be either me or Donald Trump.n"" ""And you know what else? People say all the time you know I want change will come that is certain",30001,30142
77,The question is what kind of change are we going to have,30413,30469
78,Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe havent yet voted maybe havent yet made up their mind,30630,31008
79,"I want you to ask them imagine it is January 20th 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.n"" ""Imagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures",31072,31335
80,Imagine having a president who demeans women mocks the disabled insults African Americans and Latinos,31581,31682
81,Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together,32049,32116
82,"Someone who always puts himself first and doesnt care who gets hurt along the wayn"" ""A president with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him",32435,32597
83,Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope,32878,32981
84,"The truth is we dont have to imagine what that would be like because everything that Donald Trump has said and done both in his career and in his campaign is a preview of what could happen.n"" You know as Michelle Obama says the presidency doesnt change who you are it reveals who you are",33184,33471
85,And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump,33681,33728
86,If Donald Trump were to win this election we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous,34018,34171
87,Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war,34433,34585
88,"And yet this morning in Florida Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote ""I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had""",34818,34967
89,"Now -- he knows we can see and hear him right?n ""This is someone who at another rally yesterday actually said out loud to himself stay on point Donald Stay on point",35192,35356
90,His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters stay on point Donald stay on point,35627,35713
91,You know we have seen it over and over again,36038,36082
92,We know his true self,36416,36437
93,His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head no matter how wrong he is,36757,36833
94,He cant help himself,37139,37159

98,Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair,38770,38852
99,He has no idea none about the strength of the black church the vibrancy of black owned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field,39103,39378
100,Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins,39664,39715
101,And Mae wasnt alone,40120,40139
102,"Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment their application was marked with a ""C"" -- ""C"" for colored.n ""In fact Donald his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s",40432,40709
103,They settled the case but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color,40952,41097
104,Think about that,41463,41479
105,If he were to win he would be in charge of the federal housing department,41847,41920
106,"If he doesnt respect all Americans how can we trust him to serve all Americans?n"" And then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the ""Central Park Five."" These were five black and Latino kids some as young as 14",42161,42405
107,Who it turns out were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.n Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids,42590,42776
108,Nearly three decades later they were exonerated by DNA evidence,43075,43138
109,Also someone else confessed to the crime,43522,43562
110,So they were finally released from prison and justice was done but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution he actually said they should still be in prison.n To him those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says,43831,44108
111,"Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?n  No!n "" Well people who are voting for him thats what they would get",44296,44454

116,And they placed their faith and hope in him,46456,46499
117,"Youve got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution who believe in the rule of law who believe that we are stronger together who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trumps America?n ""Its not just about communities of color",46669,47035
118,Its about young people,47235,47257
119,Its about any of us who dont ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated,47561,47697
120,"That is not who America is and were not going to let it ever go back to that.n"" ""But it doesnt end there",47946,48050
121,Youve also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters or in my case now my granddaughter growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent,48252,48505
122,Just imagine what that would mean to young womens confidence and self-worth,48769,48844
123,"And how that will affect our young men and boys who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.n"" ""So this is a pretty clear choice North Carolina",49114,49309
124,Ive said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is,49549,49627
125,Now we have to decide who we are,49956,49988
126,"Right?n"" ""And across America people are doing just that -- rejecting Trumps dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful inclusive and unifying",50299,50456

128,"We want to lift people up not tear people down.n"" ""We are called -- we are called",51162,51243

130,And we know how hard that is,51938,51966

134,I believe with all my heart that we are better than this,53511,53567

142,What happened in Flint Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies toddlers children drinking water that was poisoning them,56660,56800

152,It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes,60685,60835
153,Its wrong and were going to do something about that,61129,61180
154,"And Donald Trump whenever hes face with these issues says ""well the answer to our problems is more law and order."" He doesnt tell you what he means by that but its kind of code for fear and division",61438,61636
155,What I think we need to do is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.n I think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law,61805,62009
156,And its not all we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives because right now weve got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill felons domestic abusers terrorists,62182,62409
157,You know we cant just bow down and say theres nothing we can do commensurate with the second amendment,62665,62767

163,We need to get the engine of economic growth going because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top,65219,65369
164,We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind,65634,65773

171,First I have said and you can hold me to it I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $25000 a year,68419,68537
172,You see I come from the middle class,68803,68839
173,My dad never made anything near that even in those dollars back in those days,69132,69209
174,But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up,69479,69568
175,Not the top down that does not work for most Americans,69860,69914
176,And so secondly Im going where the money is,70235,70278
177,The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years,70592,70683
178,And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself to his family to the wealthy to corporations,70939,71110
179,"I just think thats a bad bad idea.n ""Were going to make the wealthy pay their fair share and were going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again",71330,71492

181,Tuition-free for working and middle class families and debt free for everybody else,72248,72331
182,And if youre struggling with student debt we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills and get you out from under debt,72647,72774
183,"And were going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.n"" ""But I dont think that every young person needs to go college",73048,73232

185,I just dont believe were at our best when we stoke fear about each other,73909,73981
186,Now that does not mean we have to agree about everything of course not,74271,74341
187,"But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.n"" ""I dont think I have all the answers I dont think anybody does",74587,74785

189,It wasnt one person creating our country it was many people working together,75516,75592
190,Think about every social movement every economic advance every university like this one every achievement that youve made in your own life somebody helped you,75941,76099
