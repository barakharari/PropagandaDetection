9,Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency – and the media donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense,3982,4208
10,The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election,4460,4580
11,"""The documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillarys illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger."" They show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti",4846,5111
12,They show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals,5419,5496
13,They also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign,5881,5971

15,"""Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and gone to jail for her crimes",6772,6848
16,The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes – and I guarantee you the Clintons are laughing at them,7148,7322

Instead of being held accountable Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election",7515,7901
18,The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing completely false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her President,8111,8247

21,We are not going to let it happen,9354,9387

23,Americans have had it with the years the decades of Clinton Corruption,10127,10197
24,They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries,10532,10601
25,This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough,10952,11023
26,"Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally ""open trade and open borders."" By ""open trade"" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars",11304,11523
27,"By ""open borders"" she means totally unlimited immigration",11828,11885
28,When she thought no one was listening Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States,12253,12367
29,Either we win the election or we lose the country,12715,12764
30,A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders,13137,13194
31,And yes we will build a wall,13563,13591
32,A wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth,13903,14031
33,When I won the New Hampshire primary I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities,14303,14437
34,I am now doubling-down on that promise and can guarantee you – we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves,14659,14879
35,New Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country,15129,15206
36,We have to solve this crisis,15561,15589
37,I have to give credit to my running mate Mike Pence on this issue,15975,16040
38,Mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction,16370,16547
39,We must make similar efforts a priority for the nation,16900,16954
40,Not too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other,17278,17435
41,Their story of prescription drugs heroin wait times for treatment and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic,17689,17868
42,First we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country,18153,18214
43,The number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008,18555,18621
44,"""Ive received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers and under a Trump Administration we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.""

46,We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs,19849,20010
47,President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers many of them kingpins and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories,20338,20515
48,Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach turning our streets back over to gangs drug cartels and armed career criminals,20844,20984
49,Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system,21354,21463
50,Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence or ties to transnational gangs and cartels,21816,22004
51,Second we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service,22305,22467
52,These traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S,22751,22869
53,A Trump administration will crack down on this abuse and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission,23178,23302

55,It is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction,24108,24198

59,Recovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives,25924,26004
60,We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely but when patients become addicted to those drugs we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need,26359,26522
61,"""As president Id work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision."" ""At the same time DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S",26738,27060
62,"We have 5 percent of the worlds population but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids."" Finally we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need",27236,27410
63,Congress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act,27724,27821
64,This legislation is an important step,28227,28264
65,I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment,28661,28766
66,These can be a cost effective appropriate and humane response to addiction,29159,29233
67,I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment,29631,29744
68,"""I would dramatically expand first responders and caregivers access to Narcan an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives."" I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration",30099,30308
69,Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention,30609,30755
70,Together these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs,31043,31178

72,The wealth has been raided from our country leaving behind dilapidated communities rusted out factories and shattered dreams,31873,31997
73,At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals,32344,32421
74,47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps,32778,32857
75,We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression,33185,33320

82,"""If I win day one we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA",36206,36279
83,"If we dont get the deal we want well leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal."" We are going to start making things in America again",36536,36680

88,We will become the great jobs magnet of the world,38606,38655
89,Wages will rise jobs will return and factories will come rushing onto our shores,38999,39079

91,You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true,39845,39928
92,On November 8th the arrogance of Washington D.C,40266,40313
93,will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter,40656,40727
94,I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans,41009,41164
95,Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag,41442,41569
