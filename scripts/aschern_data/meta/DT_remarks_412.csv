73,These are all forgotten Americans – they are not Hollywood or media stars or big money special interest donors,31815,31925
74,She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests,32313,32364
75,This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy,32749,32853
76,Every day more and more alarming facts come out,33245,33292
77,"""The scandal I speak of is the State Departments Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton."" If our Secretary of State can be bought or bribed or sell or trade government favors then the whole American system is threatened",33597,33820

80,"""The new revelations about Hillary Clintons email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg."" ""Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes",34939,35103
81,Thats why she deleted 33000 emails,35447,35481
82,"Thats also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public."" She said she never sent or received classified materials",35831,35960
83,That was a lie proved over and over again,36303,36344
84,She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device,36698,36788
85,But she used multiple devices,37156,37185
86,Another lie,37594,37605
87,Under penalty of perjury she said she turned over all of her work-related emails,37974,38054
88,But the FBI found thousands she never turned over and now just found another 15000 more,38396,38483
89,Another Clinton lie,38845,38864
90,She said she sent nothing marked classified,39247,39290
91,A total lie unmasked to the world,39661,39694
92,And more to come,40071,40087
93,She said her server was secure and had no breaches,40450,40500
94,But we know now it was completely unsecure and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies,40815,40932
95,More Clinton lies,41273,41290
96,Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them,41665,41739

98,Lie after lie after lie,42554,42577
99,Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office,42969,43015
100,"""It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins",43373,43470
101,It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office,43797,43888
102,"They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money."" It goes back to the Arkansas days and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors",44152,44348
103,But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business – or more accurately their crime enterprise – grew with the roles reversed,44589,44727
104,Bill now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President,45004,45198
105,They turned this into an exponentially larger business,45519,45573
106,But it was more than a business it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise,45951,46031
107,It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States,46376,46496
108,The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same,46812,46929
109,If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton you got an entry to the Department of State,47226,47356
110,Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s,47653,47793
111,"""Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills",48133,48181
112,She was Secretary of State Clintons Chief of Staff,48580,48630
113,You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business,49003,49089
114,"But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation – no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages."" We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation",49313,49679
115,This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case,49897,49955
116,In other words they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise,50312,50394
117,The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech,50723,50822
118,I walked through two of them yesterday – the sale of U.S,51167,51223
119,Uranium to Russia and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech,51545,51656
120,The UBS saga is another one,52001,52028
121,Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans,52369,52513
122,She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement,52831,52910
123,Of the 52000 accounts the U.S,53288,53317
124,was seeking the government settled for only 4450 accounts,53723,53780
125,Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual,54161,54214
126,Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60000 to the Foundation,54584,54661
127,After the Clinton favor for UBS it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600000 contribution a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton,54966,55136
128,This is corruption pure and simple,55436,55470
129,This is why I have called for a special prosecutor,55814,55864
130,"""Justice is supposed to be blind",56217,56249
131,"Its never supposed to be for sale."" In the long-run there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J",56563,56689
132,Trump,57020,57025
133,Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law,57399,57442
134,Come November the American people will show her that she is not,57780,57843
135,You will be voting for justice fairness and equality,58188,58240
136,You will also be voting for a more inclusive country where no one is left out,58583,58660
137,Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty,58997,59064
138,Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1000 under President Obama,59438,59519
139,The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent,59885,59956
140,Our pro-growth pro-jobs pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation,60313,60415
141,I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty,60751,60839
142,We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future,61126,61256
143,The era of division is coming to end,61558,61594
144,We will create a new future of American unity,61941,61986

148,We will be one people,63543,63564
149,We will share together one great future,63953,63992
150,"""Its going to be America First."" Together we will make America proud again",64403,64477
