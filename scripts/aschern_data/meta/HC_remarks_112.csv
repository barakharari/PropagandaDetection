0, And welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire,0,103
1,Thanks very much for being with us,546,580
2,You heard from Senator Bernie Sanders,1023,1060
3,Please welcome the former secretary of State Hillary Clinton,1503,1563
4,  Please,1989,1995
5, Hello,2431,2436
6, Welcome,2872,2879
7, Thank you very much,3295,3314
8,""" So youve obviously had a pretty incredible several past couple of days",3697,3769
9,Congratulations on winning in Iowa,4147,4181
10,New Hampshire has always been good to the Clintons,4558,4608
11,"How does it feel out there?"" "" It feels great",4961,5006
12,Ive had just an amazing time,5358,5386
13,We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there and then got to work the next day,5680,5803
14,And Im seeing a lot of old friends meeting a lot of new people,6064,6126
15,I have an uphill climb and Im going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire,6358,6491
16,As you said theyre people that I feel very close to,6740,6791
17,Theyve been good to my husband to me my family,7103,7149
18,But whats most important is the first in the nation primary,7471,7530
19,"It truly is a great opportunity to get out there explain what you want to do as president present your ideas and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire."" "" Bernie Sanders just a short time ago said he is the underdog here",7773,7997
20,Your campaign has said you know he comes from neighboring Vermont you guys are down in the polls,8230,8326
21,"Do you feel you do better when youre fighting from behind?"" "" You know I dont know",8611,8693
22,"I...""  Does it bring out something in you? "" Well the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey whats at stake in this election because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary",8937,9158
23,But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama,9370,9528
24,"""  ""And so I — Im very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running",9789,9871
25,I mean we really have focused on issues,10180,10219
26,We share a lot of the same big progressive goals but we have different ways of going about them,10547,10642
27,We bring different experiences,10991,11021
28,But we are contrasting on issues compared to the Republicans who I think are contrasting on insults,11374,11473
29,"And I think its a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire get questions have people vet them and then let the voters make up their minds."" "" Youve talked about progressive values",11728,11954
30,Earlier in the day Senator Sanders was asked if you were progressive,12227,12295
31,He said some days,12657,12674
32,"Are you really a progressive? In the past you have said you plead guilty to being a moderate.""  Well you know you asked me this question in the first debate right? "" I did",12969,13139
33,"And its coming up again today."" "" And I said that Im a progressive who likes to get things done",13370,13465
34,And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign Barack Obama would not be a progressive Joe Biden would not be a progressive Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive even the late great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive,13631,14032
35,So Im not going to let that bother me,14228,14265
36,I know where I stand,14611,14631
37,I know who stands with me,14982,15007
38,I know what Ive done,15352,15372
39,But I dont think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved,15631,15826
40,And I dont think its appropriate that you know if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me you know theyre thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment,16026,16229
41,Thats just not anything we need to do,16529,16566
42,Lets have a good contest of ideas,16928,16961
43,Lets contrast where we stand,17341,17369
44,"And thats what I intend to do for the next couple of days.""  It would obviously be historic if you were elected president first female president",17683,17826
45," You think so?     "" Ive studied a little bit of history",18139,18190
46,But it seems like young women arent rallying to this potentially historic moment,18530,18610
47,And I say this in Iowa among women under 30 Senator Sanders beat you by 70 points,18930,19011
48,"Why do you think that is?"" "" Thats amazing",19334,19376
49,Yes,19728,19731
50,Look you know I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people men and women supporting me,20033,20132
51,"But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for what Ive accomplished what I want to do for young people in our country."" "" Why do you think it is? That theyre..."" "" But I — well you know I dont really know Anderson",20312,20551
52,I think — heres what I want young people to know,20747,20795
53,They dont have to be for me Im going to be for them,21081,21132
54,It doesnt really matter,21443,21466
55,"""  If they are not supporting me I will be their president I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve",21763,21891
56,"""As I speak with young people across the country in Iowa New Hampshire and elsewhere I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged put on the wrong side of American opportunity",22152,22342
57,And I understand that,22655,22676
58,I mean the student debt problems the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get,22987,23169
59,But at the same time Im so impressed by the level the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment fighting climate change,23322,23648
60,So Im impressed with them,23909,23934
61,And Im going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important,24271,24372
62,But youve got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people,24655,24735
63,I have a lot experience doing that,25048,25082
64,I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country,25419,25488
65,"And I hope to have the chance to win their support."" "" Whats wrong with a revolution?"" "" Well thats for Sen",25789,25896
66,Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people,26189,26273
67,I have a different take on it,26610,26639
68,I think the progress that we have made and particularly the Democratic Party has made has been hard fought for hard won and must be defended,26944,27084
69,So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act,27377,27420
70,It is one of the great accomplishments not only of this president but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman,27751,27871
71,"""  The Republicans are..",28197,28220
72,  You know the Republicans are determined to repeal it,28583,28635
73,And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies,28986,29057
74,Sen,29424,29427
75,Sanders and I share the same goal,29818,29851
76,We want to get to universal health care coverage,30226,30274
77,Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare as you remember,30626,30698
78, I remember,31063,31073
79,""" I fought really hard",31477,31499
80,The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me,31875,31947
81,I know what its like to go up against the status quo and special interests,32297,32371
82,So when President Obama succeeded I was thrilled,32727,32775
83,I dont agree with Sen,33163,33184
84,Sanders that we should start over that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again,33522,33647
85,Were at 90 percent coverage,33978,34005
86,Im going to fix what needs to be fixed,34342,34380
87,Were going to move from 90 to 100 which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100,34664,34765
88,So we have a difference,35034,35057
89,And I think that..,35384,35402
90,"""  ..",35736,35740
91,is the difference,36085,36102
92, I want you to meet some of the folks in our audience,36426,36478
93, Sure,36811,36815
94,""" This is Dave Skinell",37182,37204

99,Clinton,39151,39158
100,You — the next president will have as many as three Supreme Court appointments to make,39516,39602
101, Right,39966,39971
102,""" Im wondering beyond abortion are there any issues on which you would impose or assert a litmus test",40341,40442
103,"And if your answer is no arent certain critical issues like marriage equality campaign finance just so vital to what we believe in as Democrats that you would have to know the answer as to how these justices would rule before you make the nomination?"" "" Well Ill tell you what Dave",40659,40940
104,I do have a litmus test,41156,41179
105,I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you,41502,41557
106,The next president could get as many as three appointments,41878,41936
107,You know one of the many reasons why we cant turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court,42235,42362
108,Im looking for people who understand the way the real world works who dont have a kneejerk reaction to support business to support the idea that you know money is speech that gutted the Voting Rights Act,42606,42809
109,I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate,43064,43145
110,It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research,43471,43549
111,Supreme Court comes along,43902,43927
112,They substitute their judgment for the Congress signed by George W,44290,44356
113,Bush,44719,44723
114,That is one of our problems,45097,45124
115,They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is,45433,45563
116,So they have given way too much power to corporations,45857,45910
117,They have given Citizens United the biggest gift to the Koch brothers Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I dont share and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back,46174,46370
118,We have to preserve marriage equality,46654,46691
119,We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community..,47013,47085

124,Im looking for people who are rooted in the real world who know that part of the genius of our system both economic and government is this balance of power,48758,48913
125,If it gets too far out of whack so that business has too much power any branch of the government has too much power the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it,49087,49353
126,So I have very strong feelings about what Ill be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court,49553,49681

133,This may come a little bit from right field this may seem but its very personal to me and resonates probably with many other people who are elderly dealing with health issues,52133,52307
134,The question is coming to me as a person who is walking with colon cancer,52581,52654
135,And Im walking with colon cancer with the word terminal very much in my vocabulary comfortably and spiritually,52995,53105
136,"But I wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people to help enhance and — their end of life with dignity.""

146,""" — that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision in consultation by their families even in some cases with medical professionals",57203,57389
147,But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors,57691,57783
148,So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical religious faith-based perspective,58114,58229
149,So heres how I think about it,58568,58597
150,"I want — I want as president to try to catalyze that debate because I — I believe youre right this is going to become an issue more and more...""  Exactly",58898,59050

152,We are on the good side having many people live longer but often then with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on but at some point dont want to continue with the challenges that poses,59634,59832
153,So I dont have any easy or glib answer for you,60099,60145
154,I think I would want to really immerse myself in the — the — the ethical writings the health writings the scientific writings the religious writings,60445,60593
155,I know some other countries the Netherlands and others have a quite open approach,60900,60981
156,Id like to know what their experience has been,61331,61377
157,Because we — we have to be sure that nobody is coerced nobody is under duress,61701,61778
158,And that is a difficult line to draw,62105,62141
159,"So I thank you — I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that were all going to have to do some thinking about.""  Thank you  ",62416,62581

168,I mean I — Id like to be able to say I could but heres what I can say,66205,66274
169,I have learned and have been you know really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years,66532,66646
170,And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice,66937,67003
171,"That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans."" ""I worked very hard as secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict",67298,67463
172,Thats why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place,67677,67899
173,I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region and maybe even led to conflict,68082,68298
174,I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad getting us involved in military conflicts,68567,68684
175,But I cant in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in Americas best vital national security interest,68946,69159
176,So I want to be honest with you,69419,69450
177,I will do what I can I will stand against adventurism ill thought out missions,69782,69860
178,I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria,70185,70240
179,That is off the table,70575,70596
180,That would be a terrible mistake,70956,70988
181,We will continue to use Special Forces and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face,71322,71415
182,You know the network of terrorist organizations — not just ISIS but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia — pose serious threats to friends allies and partners as well as to ourselves,71656,71896
183,And weve got to keep our country safe and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS to end that terrorist threat,72102,72237
184,So I will be a very careful deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices because I know whats at stake,72485,72593
185,And I know you can understand why there cant be from me anyway a blanket statement,72883,72965
186,"But I want to assure you I will be transparent I will be open and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners.""  I want to follow up the — yesterday on Capitol Hill the Senate Armed Services Committee the Commander of the Marine Corps said that he thinks and I quote all eligible and qualified men and women should register for the draft talking about Selective Service",73078,73559

188,That if were going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers they can compete to be Navy Seals they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military,74020,74283
189,I I have to think about whether I think its necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending,74504,74612
190,You know from my perspective the all-volunteer military has worked and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country,74876,75075
191,The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where thats going to come out,75316,75440
192,Where I want people to register I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically and I think if — if we had you know if we had a system like that I would I would be very very pleased about it,75620,75850

202,You know I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake,79653,79719
203,And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administrations approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq,80032,80168
204,The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections,80466,80640

233,And so now that Ive been through this for so many years Sean my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed,91620,91769
234,They play to keep,92077,92094
235,They play to destroy,92469,92489
236,They are constantly doing whatever they can to win,92862,92912
237,And they have a history now going back you know 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they cant otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack,93210,93376
238,So right now for example a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me,93643,93750
239,Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me,94065,94142
240,I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say,94421,94526
241,And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy bad for our economy bad for our societies,94759,94920

243,But Im the one who has the experience to do that,95566,95614
244,Its unlike anything youve ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue terrible attacks,95923,96042

257,They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy and you know getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to,101194,101356

281,And you know I testify for 11 hours theres nothing to Benghazi they dont give it up they keep coming after it,110629,110738
282,So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am what I stand for and what Ive always done,110972,111086
283,Ive always been guided by the same values,111353,111394
284,I have always listened to people,111710,111742

308,Um I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility about service and self-gratification all of the human questions that all of us deal with but when you put yourself out into the public arena I think its incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible,120459,120847
309,This is hard for me,121030,121049
310,You know I never thought Id be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president,121350,121448
311,I always wanted to be of service,121736,121768
312,I met my husband who was such a natural knew exactly what he wanted to do,122077,122150
313,I was happy to support him while I worked in the Childrens Defense Fund and legal services and taught law and you know had our daughter,122420,122555
314,I never thought I would do this,122842,122873
315,And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people or to tell stories about you know the man I met in Rochester who — whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable,123070,123338
316,And that — that can grip me and make me feel like theres something I can do about that,123515,123601
317,So Im constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am what I believe in and what I want to do to serve? I have that dialogue at least you know once a day in some setting or another,123794,124079
318,And I dont know that there is any ever absolute answer like OK universe here I am watch me roar or oh my gosh I cant do it its just overwhelming I have to retreat,124207,124369
319,Its that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country,124576,124669
320,And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a — you know with a group of faith advisers who are close to me,124896,125019

328,And so Ive had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues political public issues,127859,127973

330,And I — I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me,128642,128731
331,And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude,129052,129108
332,So regardless of how hard the days are how difficult the decisions are be grateful,129440,129522
333,Be grateful for being a human being being part of the universe,129854,129916
334,Be grateful for your limitations,130276,130308
335,Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you to support you to advise you listen to your critics answer the questions,130626,130762

452,I just want to make sure its the right amount and the right kind,175472,175536
453,Thats why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible,175841,175914
454,But you said something else which I think is really important,176234,176295
455,We cant be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire,176617,176707
456,Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state,177016,177116
457,Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed the people that I meet the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because theyve lost their children,177424,177576
458,I just left a rally in Manchester and a woman grabbed my hand and she said I just lost my son to an overdose,177848,177956
459,So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen like Governor Hassan like Governor Shumlin of Vermont who supports me to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach a new law enforcement approach so that first-time low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? There are 23 million people who need help in our country both alcohol and drugs,178104,178529
460,There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people,178685,178771
461,So weve got to work on law enforcement,179092,179130
462,We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids which is often the first step towards heroin,179456,179576
463,We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone which is the antidote to reverse overdose save lives here in New Hampshire,179879,180016
464,Weve got to put more money into this,180356,180392
465,So all of this to me fits together,180766,180800
466,You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges,181106,181250
467,So thats what I would like to do,181546,181578
468,"""  "" I want you to meet — this is Julie Carnigan shes from Windham",181899,181964
469,"Julie?""  Hi",182300,182310
470, Hi,182676,182678
471,Thank you for taking my question,183034,183066
472,Im the proud mother of five girls two of my own three step- daughters,183380,183449
473,"And unfortunately they are all ""feeling the Bern."" And I would like to know what you would do to convince them to vote for you",183727,183853
474," How old are they? "" Theyre in their — 21 22 and a couple of 23s and a 25-year-old",184107,184188
475,"""  "" Well first of all tell them Im glad theyre interested in politics and I really mean that",184445,184537
476,I want them to be involved,184827,184853
477,"I want them to feel like I felt when I was that age some years ago and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time."" I also want them to take a look at my record what I have done my entire life starting as a young lawyer working for the Childrens Defense Fund taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the South",185009,185434
478,I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers standing up for equality under the law defending peoples rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve,185548,185762
479,And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from you know starting the Childrens Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady,185923,186212
480,Getting healthcare for our National Guard,186496,186537
481,Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons,186902,186971
482,A long list,187359,187370
483,And the reason I say that is I think its very important that as people move toward the primary on Tuesday whatever your age you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done,187667,187886
484,And as Ive said and I mean it absolutely I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders,188139,188226
485,"But as the ""Concord Monitor"" said today in its writing about this you know its its very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable",188497,188646
486,So I dont want to over promise,188929,188959
487,Weve got too much of that,189275,189300
488,I want to tell people what I will do,189611,189647
489,I want to be specific because I do want to — to go back to the question I was asked earlier — recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America,189898,190056
490,We need to set big goals again,190330,190360
491,I am all for that,190714,190731
492,I have big ambitious goals,191088,191114
493,Affordable college early childhood education making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave all of which will help your daughters,191428,191567
494,But I also want them to hold me accountable,191869,191912
495,I want them to say OK hows that actually going to happen? What do we have to do to make it? Weve got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate,192162,192314
496,Nancy Pelosi has said were not going to revisit healthcare,192575,192633
497,Were going to stick with the Affordable Care Act,192968,193016
498,Thats exactly where I am,193375,193399
499,Were going to improve it,193775,193799
500,Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in peoples lives,194157,194243
501,I am a progressive who gets results,194577,194612
502,And I will be a progressive President who gets results,194967,195021
503,And the final thing I would say is it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young womens ambitions,195331,195452
504,And Im going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling,195759,195825
505,I hope it splinters completely and and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically,196107,196277
506,But in their lives their profession how theyre treated,196568,196622
507,I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment,196966,197021
508,Thats what I want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter and thats what I want for your daughters,197331,197434
509,"  """,197774,197775
510,Just as we did with Senator Sanders weve talked about a lot of important policy issues,198117,198203

512,Well see about that,198891,198910

517,I had the best time you know,200637,200665
518,I would I would end up over on the Mall sometimes walking around,200979,201043

520,Id be happy to,201714,201728
521,Here why dont you..,202066,202085
522,So you know theres nothing I like better than to be anonymous as hard as that is to achieve,202386,202477
523,So I would spend the day you know out in nature talking a long walk walking through one of the beautiful towns here in New Hampshire stopping in a cafe stopping in a bookstore,202721,202896
524,You know maybe calling some of my friends some of whom are here tonight and say dont tell anybody but meet me you know there,203137,203261
525,Thats what I thats what I want to do and its what I get the great joy out of,203504,203580
526,I am so fortunate that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life,203835,203932

545,Obviously in 2011 your mom passed away,211306,211344
546, Right,211693,211698
547, In 2008 she was part of your campaign,212041,212078

550, Right,213171,213176
551," What do you think — what advice do you think she would give you today in this campaign in this year? "" You know my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid",213416,213709
552,And her resilience her love her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life,213859,214014

560,And people say things about those you love whether its your daughter or someone else,216952,217036
561,So she was very supportive,217378,217404
562,But you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time,217725,217805
