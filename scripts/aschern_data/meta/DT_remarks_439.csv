99,"""It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain",41954,42017
100,"That means we dont issue timetables for political reasons but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory."" We will pursue a new steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States – not a reckless interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly",42230,42574

112,They want to scare you out of voting for change,47354,47401
113,The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist – now theyve unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase,47690,47892
114,"Its just one more Clinton lie one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve.""
