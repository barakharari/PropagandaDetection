14,Im urging everybody to come out and caucus tonight to be part of this unique American process,5644,5737
15,"I hope they will come out and caucus for me."" "" So Secretary lets talk about the issue that has bedeviled your campaign",6027,6146
16,That of course is the ongoing investigation into your e-mails,6482,6543

18,They didnt release them,7345,7368
19,Because of material deemed top secret,7768,7805

22,"How do you convince voters today not to be concerned about this?"" "" Well Alisyn there is nothing new",8898,8998

24,Its a little bit like what the Republicans and others have tried to do with respect to Benghazi,9662,9757
25,Just a lot of innuendo a lot of attacks,10076,10115
26,I just know that after I testified for 11 hours answered every question nothing new came up,10437,10528
27,Most voters have made up their minds,10852,10888
28,And Im grateful for that,11248,11272
29,The same here,11639,11652
30,And I think most of the voters who have followed this know exactly whats going on here,11992,12078
31,I never made any different explanation than the one that I have made over and over again,12384,12472
32,I take classified information seriously,12835,12874
33,I did not send or receive any material marked classified and I want all of these released,13235,13324
34,This is a dispute about retroactive classification quite a mouthful,13650,13717
35,So what people talk to me about is how Im going to get incomes up how Im going to make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down and make college affordable and relieve student debt,13978,14189
36,Thats whats on voters minds,14465,14492
37,"And thats what Im talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight.""  Um but Secretary Clinton something does seem to be happening with this investigation or at least the FBI seems to be talking about it more because in the past week several media outlets have said that their sources in the FBI say quote ""somethings going to happen."" What does that mean to you? "" It means people are selectively leaking and making comments that have no basis in anything Im aware of",14639,15170
38,And you know I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course get it resolved,15240,15373
39,But I can tell you Alisyn that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks,15607,15733
40,And Im glad it isnt,16034,16053
41,Because the facts are the facts,16389,16420
42,No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families,16680,16882
43,And Ive been thrilled at the kind of reaction and response Ive been getting the crowds that we had,17114,17212
44,That last event last night was just overwhelming,17550,17598
45,"Im looking forward to people coming out expressing their opinion about who can be the best president and commander in chief for the Democratic Party and then getting on to win the Democratic nomination and being successful next November.""  Yesterday ""The New York Times"" endorsed you",17870,18152
46,They wrote that you are the right choice in terms of experience and vision,18420,18494
47,Im sure that was music to your ears,18846,18881
48,"Do you think ""The New York Times"" endorsement plays in Iowa?  Well I dont know",19223,19300
49,"But I know ""The Des Moines Register"" does and they endorsed me",19623,19685
50,"I know ""The Boston Globe"" matters and a lot of the newspapers in New Hampshire that have endorsed me and this is very gratifying because yeah there is a lot of static that goes on and the Republicans and their allies are determined to do everything they can to try to bring me down",19903,20184
51,They dont know me very well,20410,20437
52,Because I dont quit when Im fighting for what I believe in,20762,20820
53,And I believe that I can be the president who makes progress with people,21135,21207
54,And Im just going to stick with it,21537,21571
55,"And so when very respectable and responsible outlets like ""The Register"" or ""The Times"" or ""The Boston Globe"" and others look at all the candidates interview us ask us really hard questions and conclude that Im their choice for president I find that incredibly validating",21846,22117
56,And I do hope that voters pay attention to it because its a pretty tough vetting process they go through,22353,22457
57,""" Secretary Clinton thats talk about the Republicans and whats going on in terms of how the electorate feels",22767,22875
58,I know that you know that this campaign has been about how angry and how anxious people are feeling out there and of course all of the division in this country,23145,23304
59,Some people say we have never seen anything like it,23587,23638
60,Youve made a point during the campaign of talking about how you dont really like how the Republicans do become in many ways,23956,24079
61,"So how would you bring the country together including Republicans?"" "" Well the same way I always have",24376,24477
62,When Im not actually running for office I work closely with everybody including Republicans to find common ground,24794,24907
63,Thats what I did when I helped to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program that insures 8 million kids,25239,25346
64,I worked with Democrats and Republicans,25701,25740
65,Its what I did when I got to the Senate and you know worked with Republicans to get health care for our National Guard and Reserve members when they werent being deployed,26052,26222
66,I worked on responding to 9/11,26517,26547
67,I found common ground on a number of issues with respect to health care and the like,26883,26967
68,As secretary of state the same thing,27295,27331
69,So Alisyn I think that youve got to work at it every single day,27648,27711
70,There is no shortcut,28033,28053
71,You have to build the relationships and you have to be willing to try to meet people where they are and move them over,28353,28471
72,Thats the way politics works in America,28758,28797
73,Thats the way our system is set up to work,29128,29170
74,Now we can get frustrated by it,29498,29529
75,We can wish that it were smoother,29889,29922
76,But Im very proud of the record that President Obama has compiled,30270,30335
77,You know the Affordable Care Act the Dodd-Frank regulations on Wall Street getting our economy out of the ditch,30655,30766
78,The Republicans put it into working to put those sanctions on Iran the effort I led,31073,31156
79,And so much more,31501,31517
80,So I know how you get things done,31887,31920
81,I am a progressive who wants to make progress and actually produce real results in peoples lives,32242,32338
82,Thats what Im offering,32657,32679
83,Im not overpromising,33045,33065
84,Im laying out the plans that I have,33422,33457
85,Im asking people to look at them and Im asking people to hold me accountable,33794,33870
86,Because I want to get back to working together to try to unite this country to make it possible for us to set big goals and achieve them,34132,34268
87,"Thats what I intend to do."" "" Lets talk about how this differs for you than 2008",34533,34613
88,Once again you find yourself here in Iowa with an opponent who some think sort of came out of nowhere but who has garnered a lot of excitement,34872,35014
89,"So why isnt this deja vu all over again for you today?"" "" Well look I always thought wed have a close contest and I think that is good",35239,35373
90,Its good for the Democratic Party,35657,35690
91,But Im thrilled at my campaign and we learned a lot of lessons,36016,36078
92,We have applied those lessons,36422,36451
93,We have got a great team working literally around the clock,36806,36865
94,I think Im a better candidate,37230,37259
95,I think my experience as secretary of state gave me a depth and understanding about what the next president will face that frankly nobody else running on either side could have,37569,37745
96,And I think that what voters are looking for is a way out of their frustration,38027,38105
97,Yeah people are angry,38464,38485
98,People are disappointed,38873,38896
99,People are worried,39292,39310
100,You know what happened in the Great Recession was a body blow,39670,39731
101,I mean 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million houses were lost and $13 trillion and family wealth was wiped out,40048,40167
102,People havent gotten a raise,40495,40523
103,They have been working but they dont feel like they are getting ahead,40867,40936
104,So they deserve — the American people deserve to be worried,41276,41335
105,But what Im offering is a way forward,41677,41714
106,You know once you get through the anger and the political attacks and all the rest of it people have to ask themselves who can do the most for me and my family? Who can protect our country? Who can get the economy going and incomes rising and make sure the Affordable Care Act works and get prescription drug costs down? I know how to do this and Im ready,41888,42243
107,"Im experienced and I think I have got the best shot at becoming both the nominee and the next president.""  Secretary Clinton we will be watching of course with great interest what unfolds over the next 12 hours",42347,42556
