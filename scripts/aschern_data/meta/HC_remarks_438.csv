1,"And a lot of people were hanging out of the windows and were glad that youve got the best view of what were doing here.n"" ""Its also exciting to be here with two weeks left because this is the most consequential election of our lifetime and to see the energy and enthusiasm that this crowd displayed – I saw it yesterday in North Carolina I saw it the day before in Ohio it really does demonstrate that Americans are really looking at whats at stake and are coming to the conclusion that we all have to be involved in the remaining days of the campaign",290,841
2,"And that everyone needs to turn out to vote.n"" ""In New Hampshire you have a lot of reasons to vote – youve got great candidates for Congress Annie Kuster and Carol Shea Porter who deserve your support and youve got a great candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern thank you!n"" ""I know that Maggie and Elizabeth and I have been out here giving the full dose but I hope that you will know what is at stake in the governors race and in sending these two extraordinary women to the House and boy it is exciting to be here with Maggie and Elizabeth because they are people who fight for you every single day",662,1263
3,"I know these women and it is a privilege to be on this stage with them.n"" Now Elizabeth Warren has a track record of making it her mission to stand up against Wall Street",1264,1434
4,"And she is going to make sure that Wall Street never wrecks Main Street again!n ""But you may not know that she was the person behind setting up the agency that protects consumers",1653,1831
5,The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and it was set up to stand against and to do something about the kinds of fraud and abuse weve seen from Wells Fargo,2079,2236
6,"And they are on the front lines of returning billions of dollars to Americans who have been cheated and defrauded by big companies by banks and others.n"" In fact I think it is fair to say some of the best TV that you can see is on C-SPAN when Elizabeth is going after a bank executive or regulator",2411,2708
7,She is refusing— refusing to let them off the hook and she is not just speaking for herself is she? She is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up,2856,3026
8,"And I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy to make sure we both grow it and make it fairer for every single person working hard here in America.n ""I know we are up here without our phones so we cannot check tweets but – I kind of expect if Donald heard what she just said he is tweeting away",3138,3470
9,She gets under his thin skin like nobody else,3645,3690
10,Whether she is calling him out of his mysterious tax returns she exposes him for what he is – temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president of the United States,3990,4166
11,And Maggie is going to be a great United States senator for New Hampshire,4442,4515
12,You do not have to take my word or Elizabeths word,4858,4908
13,Look at what she has already done,5281,5314
14,"Under Maggies leadership New Hampshire has the lowest unemployment rate in the entire country.n"" During her governorship it was ranked as the best state in the country for business and she has done it the New Hampshire way",5601,5823
15,She has brought people together Democrats and Republicans and Independents and I think she has the biggest legislature probably in the world that she has to deal with,6062,6228
16,So she has really honed her skills – listening and trying to work with people and she has taken issues that do keep families up at night,6489,6625
17,From the sky rocketing costs of college and prescription drugs  to helping students to figure out ways to afford to get their education to helping those suffering from addiction or mental health to raising wages for hard working families,6854,7090
18,What I love about Maggie is that she is independent she knows how to find common ground and how to stand her ground,7337,7452
19,"And that is exactly the kind of leader we need in the United States Senate.n ""Because weve got to break through the gridlock and dysfunction that has unfortunately marred Washington",7710,7891
20,We have to get back to listening respectfully,8217,8262

22,"And that is why we need leaders like Maggie and unlike her opponent she has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.n"" She knows he should not be a role model for our kids or anybody else for that matter",8971,9180
23,So I hope in these next 14 days you do everything you can to support her,9396,9468

25,And Maggie is leaving some big shoes,10097,10133
26,She does not look like it but she is she is leaving some big shoes to fill as governor,10422,10508
27,Colin is the person for that job,10808,10840
28,"You know as a member of Executive Council and I remember this because it took a lot of guts.n ""He helped lead the fight for funding Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire",11132,11299

30,"He also worked with Maggie to cross party lines to help expand Medicaid to more than 50000 granted stators.n"" ""And Colin wants to do more to invest clean energy like wind and solar to hold down energy costs to create more good jobs here in New Hampshire and to protect the beautiful environment of this state",11867,12175

33,"Ive tried to use the time I had in all three to talk about what people talk to me about starting here in New Hampshire and going across the country because I take it really seriously.n"" I think that the problems that keep you up tonight that stand in the way of your getting ahead and staying ahead of providing the best opportunity of a good middle class job with a rising income for you and your kids those are the problems that someone running for president should actually listen to pay attention to and come up with solutions for.n ""So you know I do have a lot of plans I do",12931,13510
34,And I get criticized for having so many plans,13603,13648
35,Tim Kaine and I have actually written a book – oh theres one copy right there! Its called – oh another copy! Its called Stronger Together and we lay out all of our plans for what we want to do if were so honored as to be president and vice president,13870,14119
36,And you know I do have this old-fashioned idea that if Im here asking for your vote to be your president I should tell you what Im going to do and maybe as I said yesterday in North Carolina maybe its a bit of a womens thing because we make lists,14238,14484
37,We do we make lists and we try to write down what were supposed to do and then cross them off as we go through the day and the week,14642,14773

41,"What a novel idea! Were actually going to try to deliver results for you.n"" ""But I got to tell you",16126,16224
42,During that debate Donald said something,16541,16581
43,Well he said a lot of things that were troubling but he said something truly horrifying,16922,17009
44,He became the first person running for president – Republican or Democrat – who refused to say that he would respect the results of this election,17306,17451
45,Now that is a direct threat to our democracy,17762,17806
46,Im not going to try to call it anything else because thats what it is,18138,18207
47,All this talk about the election being rigged trying to stir up people who are supporting him at his rallies that is a direct threat to our democracy,18475,18624
48,And I got to tell you – as your secretary of state I went to 112 countries and I went to countries where people were jailed for being political opponents where they were exiled where they were killed,18824,19023
49,"I take this really seriously.n"" ""And for me the peaceful transfer of power is one of the things that makes our country great – something that – something we cant lose something we shouldnt even doubt",19239,19438

52,More than 200 million Americans are now registered to vote,20562,20620
53,And most exciting that includes more than 50 million young people the biggest number ever,20967,21056
54,Now you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they believe in and Im proud to see Americans coming together – Democrats Republicans and Independents – to reject hate and division,21345,21549
55,"And were seeing that in New Hampshire too.n"" ""We are more than our disagreements we Americans",21826,21919
56,There is so much more that unites us than divides us,22266,22318
57,Im proud to have the support of more than 150 Republican leaders in this state who put country before party,22635,22742
58,But this energy were seeing is not just because of what were against as important as that is its because what were for,23024,23142
59,"Its about fighting for a future where everyone counts where everyone has a place and no one is left out or left behind.n"" ""Because to me and I hope to you as well this is about more than winning an election its about the kind of country we want for our kids and our grandkids",23330,23605
60,Thats what this has to be about,23821,23852
61,Its about the lessons we want to pass on to our sons and our daughters,24171,24241
62,You know we believe we should honor the men and women who fight for our country and that America is safer when we work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence,24481,24664
63,Yet my opponent attacked a grieving Gold Star family whose son died in Iraq,24927,25002
64,He has no plan to defeat ISIS,25336,25365
65,And just last night he tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already and I quote a total disaster,25658,25809
66,And that our country is quote looking so dumb,26087,26132
67,Imagine imagine this is a guy who says he knows more about ISIS than the generals,26459,26540
68,I dont think so,26881,26896
69,Hes basically declaring defeat before the battle has even started,27254,27319
70,Hes proving to the world what it means to have an unqualified commander in chief,27653,27733
71,"Its not only wrong its dangerous and it needs to be repudiated on November the 8th here in New Hampshire and across America.n"" ""But just in case you think that this is new for Donald it shouldnt surprise you or anybody else and Ill tell you why",27971,28215
72,He has been denigrating America for decades,28482,28525
73,It started before he campaigned against me,28900,28942
74,It started before President Obama took office,29307,29352
75,In fact back in 1987 he spent $100000 on an ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan,29697,29794
76,He said and I quote The world is laughing at America,30126,30178
77,Does that sound familiar? This is someone who roots for failure and takes glee in mocking our country no matter who our president is,30478,30610
78,Now that may be who Donald Trump is but this election is about who we are,30876,30949
79,"And I want us – I want us to remember America is great because America is good right? And as our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama said right here in New Hampshire When they go we go high.n"" ""This election poses a very clear choice on the economy",31160,31408
80,When the middle class thrives America thrives,31668,31713
81,As Elizabeth said she is a perfect example of how that works in America,32050,32121
82,So am I,32465,32472
83,So are every one of you here,32842,32870
84,Thats what I want for every single person especially young person in America,33213,33289
85,"With your help were going to not only have Elizabeth back in the Senate but send Maggie send Carol send Annie and then make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II.n"" ""What does that mean? That means jobs in infrastructure our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our mass transit our water systems",33514,33829
86,There is a lot of great work to be done here,34053,34097
87,And guess what? Those are jobs that cant be exported,34439,34491
88,Theyve got to be done right here in New Hampshire and across America,34812,34880
89,I want us to invest in advanced manufacturing and there are I know a lot of skeptics about that,35189,35284
90,They say Well we cant compete in manufacturing anymore,35605,35659
91,Well Ill tell you what,36027,36049
92,I dont want us competing with low wage jobs,36419,36462
93,I want us competing for the high wage jobs,36830,36872
94,Germany is a major exporter of advanced manufacturing products,37251,37313
95,"I want to compete with Germany and countries like that precision machining 3D printing.n"" ""I want us to invest more in technology innovation and research and yes in clean energy because were going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century",37607,37867
96,I think we can deploy a half a billion more solar panels within the first four years and enough clean energy to power every home by the end of 10 years,38073,38224
97,"Thats what I want people to be working on and thinking about and striving to achieve.n"" ""And I am really excited about what we can do to make sure every young American is prepared",38446,38625

99,I want kids to be prepared to succeed,39268,39305
100,Because we are in a competition and you know what? I want us to step up and compete and win,39600,39691
101,And I want our schools – I want kids to have good teachers and good schools in every zip code and I want to be a good partner with our teachers and our educators here in New Hampshire,39891,40074
102,And I want to bring back technical education to high school,40324,40383
103,"I think we really – we really shut the door on too many young people who couldve gotten skills that wouldve given them the chance to get ahead.n"" ""And working with our community colleges we need to make sure that every young person and every person coming back to upgrade or change skills can go to a community college",40601,40919
104,And yes we are going to make four-year college affordable,41141,41198
105,Just this week a new report came out showing that New Hampshire students have very high levels of debt and I know Maggie has been fighting that,41504,41647
106,And shes had a moratorium and shes done what she could at the state level,41939,42012
107,"But we got to work together at the national level to make this happen for students in New Hampshire families in New Hampshire.n"" ""So after our primary was over – and you know what I was really proud – I was really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran",42234,42499
108,And it was a campaign – it was a campaign about ideas not insults,42698,42763
109,And thats what campaigns should be about,43071,43111
110,And after it was over Bernie and I got together,43457,43504
111,We put our heads together,43845,43870
112,And we came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125000 a year,44181,44310
113,And if you make more than that it will be debt free,44591,44642
114,In other words pay what you can but lets not have kids and families going into debt to get an education,44946,45049
115,This should be an investment that we make on behalf of them and our countrys future,45324,45407
116,And no matter where you go to a great school like this or anywhere else we will help you pay down your student debt,45680,45795
117,We will make is easier because we a re going to make it as a percentage of you income so you will never be on the hook for more than you can afford,46008,46155
118,"And if your interested to see how much you and your family can save you can actually go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you can save under this plan that we are proposing.n"" Now I think in addition to growing the economy we need to do a lot more on small business",46330,46610
119,Two-thirds of new jobs will come from small business so we are going to be just focused on how we are going to be able to start and grow your small business,46777,46933
120,And then we do have to make the economy fairer and that starts with raising the national minimum wage because if you work full time I am talking about full time workers you should not still be in poverty at the end,47124,47338
121,Work should provide a ladder of opportunity for people willing to work for it to climb,47578,47664
122,Right?n We are going to guarantee equal pay we are going to make affordable child care so nobody pays more than 10 percent of your income for childcare,47938,48089
123,We are going to work for paid family leave,48374,48416
124,Because this is the way families are today,48755,48797
125,We are not living in the 1950s,49139,49169
126,Families are under new stresses and strains and I meet so many who are really just at the edge,49501,49595
127,They are making all they can make,49931,49964
128,"One parent working full-time two parents working full-time sometimes part-time on top of full-time.n ""The other day Tim Kaine and I were in Pittsburgh",50287,50437
129,There was a long line of people big overflow which we couldnt get into the main room where we were,50724,50822
130,So Tim was talking to the families there and there was a woman holding her three-year-old child a daughter I think,51102,51216
131,Tim was shaking hands and the woman looked and she said I came here hoping that I could tell you or Secretary Clinton that I had my baby three years ago and the day after I had my baby I was fired because I called and ask if I could have a few weeks because it had been a difficult pregnancy,51393,51684
132,But my baby was fine but not all that she needed to be,51857,51911
133,I got fired,52217,52228
134,And Tim came in and he is such a wonderful man,52540,52586
135,What a fine human being,52904,52927
136,And he said To be there are the reasons everyday why I get so motivated in this election and I just have another reason,53214,53333
137,He told me that story,53641,53662
138,I think your president should care about that,54009,54054
139,"I think your president should wake up everyday thinking Okay how do I help empower the most people to make the most out of their own lives how to break down the barriers that give you the chance to go as far as your hard work and talent will take you? Sometimes people say How are you going to get all this done? I have proposed plans that do not add a penny to the debt because I see some of my long time friends who back in the 1992 campaign – where my husband ended up we had a balance budget and a surplus and actually we were on the way to paying down the national debt but here is what happened.n"" ""What happened is trickle-down economics came back",54082,54736
140,So here is what I am going to do,54761,54793
141,We are going to ask the wealthy to finally pay their fair share,55108,55171
142,We are going to – we are going to close the loopholes we are going to end the fact that millionaires can pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer,55400,55571
143,We are going to make big banks pay for the risks they pose to our economy because Elizabeth is absolutely right,55799,55910
144,No – no bank is too big to fail and no one should be above the law and we are going to enforce that and contrast that with Donald Trump,56149,56284
145,"He believes that if you give trillions and that is trillions with a t in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires and billionaires and corporations and everything will work out.n"" ""Well it will for him",56499,56696
146,That is trickle down economics on steroids,57007,57049
147,And he would wipe away the tough new rules that President Obama imposed on Wall Street,57420,57506
148,He would eliminate the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau that Elizabeth did so much to create,57836,57932
149,And you know that was bad enough but then in the debates we learned he hasnt paid any income tax for years,58237,58343
150,So he hasnt paid a penny to support our military our veterans Pell grants for kids to get an education health or anything else,58601,58727
151,And his explanation was he lost a billion dollars in a year,59023,59082
152,Now Ive pondered this,59424,59445
153,Ive really pondered this,59808,59832
154,"He actually said it made him smart not to pay income taxes but how smart are you to lose a billion dollars in a year?n"" ""Has anyone here been to a casino? He lost a billion dollars running casinos",60097,60293
155,Who does that? Ive never heard of anybody,60548,60589
156,So weve got to make it clear that Donald is not on the side of America workers or American families,60908,61007
157,For all of his talk about putting America first he makes his products in at least 12 other countries,61302,61402
158,He stiffs small businesses mom and pop contractors who work for him,61716,61783
159,My dad was a small business owner,62128,62161
160,He worked really hard,62533,62554
161,"Im just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because it was hard work and people who do that work should be rewarded not taken advantage of.n"" ""So we know a lot about how Donald Trump works and today today we heard yet another story",62801,63043
162,Its about a maintenance worker at one of his golf courses,63295,63352
163,This maintenance courses told his co-workers he was gay and they started harassing him,63689,63775
164,They used anti-gay slurs to his face they threw rocks and golf balls at him his supervisor saw it and did nothing and it got so bad he wound up in the hospital,64041,64200
165,Finally he went to the police for help,64461,64499
166,He couldnt go back to work because he was too scared for his safety and then he was fired by Trumps golf club,64781,64890
167,Now this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels,65200,65254
168,For starters its a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination that too many LGBT Americans still face every day,65576,65707
169,And it is deeply disturbing that instead of stepping in to stop the tormentors Trumps golf club turned on the victim for coming forward,66005,66140
170,"If thats how Donald Trump runs his business what does that say about how he would run our country?n"" ""So my friends there are lots of reasons so many to take this election seriously",66391,66572
