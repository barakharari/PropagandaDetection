1,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Together we will lead our party back to the White House and we will lead our country back to safety prosperity and peace,544,688
2,We will be a country of generosity and warmth,1019,1064
3,But we will also be a country of law and order,1396,1442
4,Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation,1772,1830
5,The attacks on our police and the terrorism in our cities threaten our very way of life,2140,2227
6,Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country,2549,2625
7,Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities,2953,3080
8,Many have witnessed this violence personally some have even been its victims,3411,3487
9,I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end,3769,3905
10,Beginning on January 20th of 2017 safety will be restored,4173,4230
11,The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens,4547,4623
12,Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead,4943,5010
13,It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation,5347,5425
14,I will present the facts plainly and honestly,5776,5821
15,We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore,6196,6249
16,So if you want to hear the corporate spin the carefully-crafted lies and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week,6593,6734
17,Go there,7082,7090
18,But here at our convention there will be no lies,7472,7520
19,We will honor the American people with the truth and nothing else,7895,7960
20,"These are the facts: ""Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administrations rollback of criminal enforcement."" ""Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in Americas fifty largest cities",8267,8496
21,Thats the largest increase in 25 years,8829,8867
22,In our nations capital killings have risen by 50 percent,9272,9328
23,"They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore."" ""In the Presidents hometown of Chicago more than 2000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone",9650,9812
24,"And almost 4000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office."" The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year",10049,10245
25,Nearly 180000 illegal immigrants with criminal records ordered deported from our country are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens,10525,10668
26,The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015,11003,11135
27,They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources,11450,11579
28,One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska,11904,11969
29,There he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root,12323,12389
30,She was 21 years-old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average,12717,12821
31,Number one in her class,13152,13175
32,Her killer was then released a second time and he is now a fugitive from the law,13529,13609
33,"""Ive met Sarahs beautiful family",13970,14002
34,But to this Administration their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasnt worth protecting,14352,14461
35,No more,14816,14823
36,One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders,15187,15260
37,"What about our economy?"" Again I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty while 58% of African American youth are now not employed",15508,15768
38,2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago,16017,16136
39,Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely,16475,16533
40,"""Household incomes are down more than $4000 since the year 2000",16906,16969
41,Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone,17303,17411
42,"Were going to fix that."" The budget is no better",17740,17788
43,President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion and growing,18115,18198
44,And yet what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart our airports are Third World condition and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps,18486,18657
45,Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad,18971,19018
46,Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster but they have lived through one international humiliation after another,19396,19520
47,One after another,19909,19926
48,We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint,20298,20404
49,This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated,20646,20835
50,Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing,21066,21191
51,"""In Libya our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames",21488,21591
52,"America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of Americas foreign policy."" ""Lets defeat her in November OK."" ""I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets",21811,22063
53,Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today,22295,22434
54,"Lets review the record."" In 2009 pre-Hillary ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable",22741,22831
55,Egypt was peaceful,23208,23226
56,Iraq was seeing a big big reduction in violence,23617,23664
57,Iran was being choked by sanctions,24042,24076
58,Syria was somewhat under control,24461,24493
59,After four years of Hillary Clinton what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region and the world,24838,24938
60,Libya is in ruins and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers,25238,25345
61,Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood forcing the military to retake control,25653,25747
62,Iraq is in chaos,26098,26114
63,Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons,26480,26518
64,Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West,26868,26944
65,After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost the situation is worse than it has ever been before,27226,27385
66,This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death destruction terrorism and weakness,27700,27779
67,"""But Hillary Clintons legacy does not have to be Americas legacy",28141,28205
68,The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place,28504,28694
69,A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes,28961,29027
70,"Tonight I will share with you my plan of action for America."" The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents is that our plan will put America First",29317,29491
71,Americanism not globalism will be our credo,29791,29834
72,As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect the respect we deserve,30132,30300
73,The American People will come first once again,30595,30641
74,My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods secure borders and protection from terrorism,30992,31108
75,There can be no prosperity without law and order,31457,31505
76,On the economy I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America,31828,31957
77,"""A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nations most powerful special interests",32236,32361
78,That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit,32690,32795
79,"Believe me its for their benefit."" Big business elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place",33104,33288
80,They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does,33571,33666
81,She is their puppet and they pull the strings,34014,34059
82,"""That is why Hillary Clintons message is that things will never change...never ever",34407,34490
83,My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now,34811,34887
84,"Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected ignored and abandoned."" ""I have visited the laid-off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals",35125,35376
85,These are the forgotten men and women of our country,35659,35711
86,And they are forgotten but theyre not going to be forgotten long,36068,36132
87,"People who work hard but no longer have a voice."" I am your voice! I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good",36419,36621
88,disruption in the audience How great are our police? And how great is Cleveland? I have no patience for injustice no tolerance for government incompetence no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens,36872,37074
89,"""When innocent people suffer because our political system lacks the will or the courage or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way and I wont look the other way."" ""And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server deletes 33000 of them so the authorities cant see her crime puts our country at risk lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country."" When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was ""extremely careless"" and ""negligent"" in handling our classified secrets I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did",37003,37789
90,They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes,37758,37842
91,In fact her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less have paid so dearly,38139,38316
92,When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come,38569,38746
93,I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves,39024,39140
94,Nobody knows the system better than me which is why I alone can fix it,39440,39510
95,I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance,39800,39938
96,But his supporters will join our movement because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country,40182,40347
97,Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American,40584,40714
98,In this cause I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana,40979,41099
99,And a great guy,41404,41419
100,We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana which is amazing,41748,41844
101,He is a man of character and accomplishment,42181,42224
102,He is the man for the job,42604,42629
103,The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities,42967,43119
104,America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed,43434,43526
105,In the days after Dallas we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials,43882,43988
106,Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia Missouri Wisconsin Kansas Michigan and Tennessee,44339,44451
107,On Sunday more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge Louisiana,44816,44879
108,Three were killed and three were very very badly injured,45259,45315
109,An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans,45681,45739
110,I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year I will restore law and order to our country,45999,46188
111,Believe me believe me,46476,46497
112,I will work with and appoint the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done,46814,46926
113,In this race for the White House I am the law and order candidate,47232,47297
114,The irresponsible rhetoric of our President who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen,47540,47795
115,"""This Administration has failed Americas inner cities",48081,48134
116,Remember: it has failed Americas inner cities,48522,48567
117,Its failed them on education,48957,48985
118,Its failed them on jobs,49374,49397
119,Its failed them on crime,49789,49813
120,"Its failed them at every level."" When I am President I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally and protected equally",50133,50270
121,Every action I take I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore in Chicago in Detroit in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child,50488,50712
122,To make life safe in America we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we are going to defeat them fast,50889,51075
123,Once again France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism,51362,51421
124,Men women and children viciously mowed down,51801,51844
125,Lives ruined,52234,52246
126,Families ripped apart,52643,52664
127,A nation in mourning,53063,53083
128,The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center at an office party in San Bernardino at the Boston Marathon and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga Tennessee,53375,53619
129,And many many other locations,53928,53957
130,"""Only weeks ago in Orlando Florida 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist",54342,54446
131,"This time the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and were going to stop it."" As your President I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – beleive me",54699,54942
132,And as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said,55171,55246
133,Thank you,55596,55605
134,To protect us from terrorism we need to focus on three things,55970,56031
135,"""We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world",56371,56439
136,We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq Libya Egypt and Syria,56763,56891
137,Instead we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now doing it quickly,57167,57317
138,Were going to win,57628,57645
139,"Were going to win fast."" This includes working with our greatest ally in the region the State of Israel",57987,58090
140,Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete because it did not properly cover terror and also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share,58368,58528
141,As usual the United States has been picking up the cost,58829,58884
142,Shortly thereafter it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction,59191,59336
143,"""Lastly and very importantly we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place",59605,59796
144,"We dont want them in our country."" ""My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this",60074,60187
145,Think of this,60531,60544
146,This is not believable but this is whats happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama,60880,61029
147,"She proposes this despite the fact that theres no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from."" I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people",61253,61489
148,Anyone who endorses violence hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be,61726,61828
149,Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens especially for African-American and Latino workers,62171,62318
150,We are going to have an immigration system that works but one that works for the American people,62655,62751
151,On Monday we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza Sabine Durden and my friend Jamiel Shaw,63073,63216
152,They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely,63543,63631
153,Of all my travels in this country nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border which we can solve,63901,64113
154,We have to solve it,64415,64434
155,These families have no special interests to represent them,64815,64873
156,There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf,65257,65310
157,My opponent will never meet with them or share in their pain believe me,65675,65746
158,Instead my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities,66122,66164
159,But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered and who have suffered so so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone,66362,66737
160,But they are alone no longer,66948,66976
161,Tonight this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them to send them our love and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate,67274,67487
162,"""We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration to stop the gangs and the violence and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities",67700,67861
163,I have been honored to receive the endorsement of Americas Border Patrol Agents and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful lawful lawful immigration system,68114,68298
164,"Lawful."" ""By ending catch-and-release on the border we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence",68622,68728
165,Illegal border crossings will go down,69099,69136
166,We will stop it,69547,69562
167,It wont be happening very much anymore,69976,70014
168,Believe me,70438,70448
169,Peace will be restored,70875,70897
170,"By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve."" Tonight I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say",71174,71485
171,On January 20th of 2017 the day I take the oath of office Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced,71633,71783
172,We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone,72078,72138
173,But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens,72520,72586
174,U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton,72975,73095
175,Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration,73516,73567
176,Communities want relief,74026,74049
177,"""Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty mass immigration and mass lawlessness",74497,74581
178,"Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals further reduce your jobs and wages and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that theyre going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class."" ""I have a different vision for our workers",74849,75153
179,It begins with a new fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat of which there are many,75355,75478
180,"Its been a signature message of my campaign from day one and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office."" ""I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now Im going to make our country rich again",75668,75924
181,Using the richest people in the world which our country has I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements,76117,76248
182,"America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton."" Remember it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or frankly any other country",76491,76786
183,Never ever again,77057,77073
184,I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries firing their employees along the way without consequences,77342,77565
185,Not going to happen anymore,77856,77883
186,"""My opponent on the other hand has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class",78264,78382
187,"She supported NAFTA and she supported Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husbands colossal mistakes and disasters."" ""She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea",78700,78910
188,She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership,79260,79307
189,The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments,79682,79800
190,And its not going to happen,80161,80188
191,I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom and independence,80560,80673
192,I will never ever sign bad trade deals,81038,81076
193,"America fist again! America first! Instead I will make individual deals with individual countries."" No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands",81375,81645
194,We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs against any country that cheats,81884,82027
195,"""This includes stopping Chinas outrageous theft of intellectual property along with their illegal product dumping and their devastating currency manipulation",82378,82535
196,They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated,82881,83060
197,"That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and well walk away if we dont get the deal that we want."" We are going to start building and making things again",83309,83495
198,Next comes the reform of our tax laws regulations and energy rules,83754,83820
199,While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican,84108,84320
200,Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone and I mean everyone,84614,84754
201,America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world,85126,85182
202,Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country,85534,85624
203,Believe me it will happen and it will happen fast,85955,86004
204,Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation one of the greatest job-killers of them all,86329,86427
205,Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year and we will end it very very quickly,86715,86825
206,We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy,87154,87228
207,This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades,87551,87652
208,My opponent on the other hand wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald Trump as President,87917,88097
