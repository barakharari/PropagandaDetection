6,And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James,2659,2730
7,Now I may become president but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king,3057,3142
8,Im obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability,3455,3571
9,But Ill tell you what really moved me the most is hes given back to his hometown,3895,3975
10,He has advocated for small businesses for kids giving kids more opportunities,4320,4397
11,Hes spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform,4748,4799
12,He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice,5081,5240
13,"So I am truly honored to have his support and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how I am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways."" ""Now we do have an important election coming up",5388,5656
14,Who here is planning to vote? Well that is very good news because this is the most consequential election I think in our lifetimes,5843,5973

You can go to iwillvote.com and confirm your registration and register if you need to."" ""So lets get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on October the 12th because we have just 36 days left",7269,7679
19,Thirty-six days now we are reaching out,7869,7908
20,Were making phone calls,8275,8298
21,Were knocking on doors,8673,8695

26,Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne have been here,10658,10710
27,My husbands coming back tomorrow for a two-day bus tour through Ohio,11049,11117
28,"And I will be back because we care about Ohio and we want to make sure Ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state."" ""Now Im going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago fighting for kids and families standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream",11256,11662
29,See I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody,11820,11880
30,"If youre willing to work for it and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America."" ""Now my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead and that may be because we have very different life experiences",12094,12366
31,And thats okay,12624,12638
32,People have different families different views of the world,13017,13076
33,But heres what I have noticed,13445,13474
34,I have noticed that he always puts himself first,13851,13899
35,And maybe thats because he was born into a millionaire family,14275,14336
36,He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father,14676,14739
37,His father bailed him out; apparently thats a pattern you got to be bailed out when you do business with him,15057,15165
38,"And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code of our economy that he could."" ""And along the way along the way he has stiffed people – small businesses and workers and contractors",15393,15597
39,And thats part of the reason I take this election so seriously,15862,15924
40,My dad was a small businessman,16258,16288
41,My grandfather was a factory worker,16646,16681
42,And so my dad when he got out of the Navy in World War II he started a small business,17007,17092
43,He started a printing business,17412,17442
44,He printed fabrics for draperies,17799,17831
45,And he worked really hard,18186,18211
46,He had a print plant in Chicago – no natural light no windows just a long room where there were two big long tables and the fabric would be laid out on them,18499,18655
47,And then if youve ever seen silkscreens thats what he did,18917,18974
48,You take the silkscreen,19296,19319
49,You put it down,19648,19663
50,You pour the paint in,19993,20014
51,You take the squeegee,20340,20361
52,You go across,20687,20700
53,You lift it up,21027,21041
54,You go down to the end of one long table you start on the end of the other long table,21323,21408
55,And then if it was going to be two colors you would add another color doing exactly the same thing,21659,21757
56,It was before there was machines,22065,22097
57,My dad couldnt have afforded that anyway,22442,22482
58,"But he worked really hard and he produced a good middle class life for our family."" ""And so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people I got to tell you I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him because I have met people he stiffed",22709,22987
59,I have met people,23213,23230
60,Im talking painters and plumbers,23603,23635
61,Im talking dishwashers marble installers glass installers architects a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos,23977,24094
62,He wouldnt pay them,24443,24462
63,"Now you got to stop and ask yourself what kind of person does that? Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored."" ""And so I met one of the men",24741,24914
64,I met a man who had a small family business installed the glass in one of those casinos submitted the bill and Trump said no,25137,25261
65,were not going to pay it,25547,25571
66,And the man was stunned as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been,25897,25973
67,And then they come back the Trump organization or Trump himself and say okay well give you 10 cents 20 cents maybe 30 cents on the dollar,26240,26377
68,Now some of those small businesses they couldnt afford that,26685,26744
69,They had bought the material They had provided the services,27098,27157
70,Trump didnt care,27517,27533
71,He basically just walked away from them made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work theyd been asked to provide,27855,27993
72,I got to tell you that is not the way were supposed to do business in America,28266,28343
73,And I cant imagine having a president who believes that thats the way youre supposed to treat people,28632,28732
74,"But youre going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House."" ""Now earlier today earlier today in Toledo I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of",28939,29199
75,Now the most recent example is Wells Fargo,29424,29466
76,Wells Fargo actually had people thousands of their employees putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand,29799,29946
77,And then every time they put somebody into a new account they got fees which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus – a really crummy game that hurt people,30210,30374
78,So thankfully we have an organization now the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington who looks out for people who get ...,30630,30761
79,That is an important part of how were going to protect,31080,31134
80,"And its run you may know by Richard Cordray from Ohio."" ""Now will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency? Well were not going to let that happen",31412,31582
81,That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers whove been taken advantage of by corporations,31874,31979
82,"And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008."" ""I have said were never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again and I mean it",32201,32464
83,Contrast that – contrast that with my opponent,32685,32731
84,He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street,33064,33136
85,He basically wants to let Wall Street the banks the hedge funds all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again,33436,33566
86,Well Ill tell you what were not going to let that happen,33866,33922
87,"We need more rules not fewer rules on them."" I want us to make it easier to start a small business to get rid of the red tape to make credit available to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America so we should have a big dynamic small business economy",34103,34395
88,But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore,34587,34671
89,That is not working for us,35016,35042
90,"""But Trumps whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics",35396,35462
91,Its the same – the same idea that has failed us before,35795,35849
92,You see he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down,36156,36245
93,Well we know that doesnt work,36557,36586
94,Weve been down that road,36921,36945
95,And what he wants to do is I think its fair to say trickle-down on steroids,37268,37343
96,"What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy."" ""Now Im a little confused about this because for a long time weve been saying Hey where are your tax returns? A lot of us wondered what he was hiding",37578,37783
97,Because you know if it was something that would make him look good he would put them right out there,38009,38109
98,Everybody whos ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns,38388,38486
99,My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there,38771,38832
100,You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes and frankly we were grateful we could,39100,39209
101,"We are grateful for the blessings that weve had over the last 15 years."" ""So did any of you see the debate last Monday? Well I raised it",39437,39573
102,I said Well maybe he doesnt want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders or maybe he hasnt paid any taxes,39794,39951
103,Now shortly after the debate it was discovered that indeed back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos,40198,40350
104,Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos? Really,40670,40723
105,And yesterday some of his supporters said Well it just shows hes a genius that he didnt pay any taxes,41056,41157
106,"Well what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place?"" ""In the debate he said not paying taxes made him smart",41432,41556
107,But think about what that means,41846,41877
108,It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes right – whats he saying about us? But more than that zero taxes means zero for our vets zero for our military zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college zero for health zero for education,42103,42351
109,And you stop and ask yourself this is the same person whos been going around really just dumping on America,42556,42663
110,He says our militarys a disaster,42984,43016
111,"Well he could not be more wrong but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us."" ""Today in Colorado he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes",43268,43490
112,Well that just shows number one he is the poster boy – the poster boy – for the same rigged system that he would make even worse,43690,43818
113,Just think about it,44113,44132
114,He paid zero at least for about 20 years we believe now based on what we know,44441,44518
115,And hes advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more,44806,44887
116,"Whats he want us to do pay him to lose money? Really?"" ""Theres a lot more to this story and were just slowly getting it into the public eye",45144,45283
117,So we know hes stiffed people didnt pay his bills,45557,45606
118,We know he took bankruptcy depending on how you count four or six times,45922,45993
119,You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years,46308,46360
120,We dont know what his taxes would be after that,46697,46744
121,Hes always talked about how he cant release his taxes because hes under audit but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit so Donald release everything up until 2009,47036,47214
122,"Show the American people your taxes."" ""Ill tell you another thing",47523,47588
123,"If Im fortunate enough to be president were going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes."" So what did we find out today? Well a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects",47796,48120
124,So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs he once again stiffed us,48287,48467
125,He sent that money overseas,48804,48831
126,Now he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese right? You hear that all the time when he talks,49179,49274
127,Well it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese,49562,49629
128,It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese,49945,49990
129,So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show where he is saying one thing and doing something else,50305,50428
130,"""Now for years China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets",50736,50872
131,You know that right? And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum,51196,51295
132,"How can he make America great again when he wont even buy American products in our country?"" ""And Ill tell you this is personal to me because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented",51516,51776
133,And as Secretary of State I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese,52023,52083
134,"I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China to stand up for American workers and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum."" ""And today in Toledo I pointed out because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler – about 700 more jobs right? I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job – more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here – Donald Trump said he didnt care",52182,52795
135,"Save it dont save it; didnt matter to him."" ""Well Ill tell you where I stood",52844,52920
136,I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry,53235,53294
137,And look what we got,53627,53647
138,Last year our auto industry had the best year theyve had in a really long time,53967,54045
139,And so weve got to keep building it,54356,54391
140,Weve got to keep making sure that there are good jobs,54721,54774
141,"And weve got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides."" ""So now I know that Ohio is a tough tough state",55040,55187
142,Youve got to get out there,55470,55496
143,Youve got to talk to people answer questions make your case,55822,55881
144,Thats what weve been doing,56206,56232
145,Thats what were going to do all the way to the end of this election,56549,56616
146,But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump,56891,56986
147,I know you know people,57283,57305
148,I know you do,57638,57651
149,And youve got to stage an intervention,57990,58028
150,Youve got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio,58268,58511
151,"In fact if you look at his tax proposals they benefit him and other wealthy people – hedge fund managers and the like and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families."" ""Now thats the kind of contrast were getting out in the campaign but thats why we need your help – to make sure you go out and talk to everybody",58608,58933
152,And I know people want change,59142,59171
153,Thats part of the American dynamic spirit,59507,59548
154,We want change,59893,59907
155,Well Ill tell you one thing that is certain is well have change – its just what kind of change,60236,60330
156,Its whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans hardworking Americans middle-class families or continues to only help those at the top,60611,60773
157,I want an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top,61071,61138
158,"And thats exactly what were going to fight for and that is what were going to get."" ""Ill tell you Ive been called a lot of things",61406,61535
159,Right? Ive never been called quitter,61815,61851
160,"If I tell you Im going to get up every day and fight for you that is exactly what I will do."" ""But I know I cant do it – I cant do it alone",62089,62228
161,Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America,62447,62562
162,And then he said I alone can fix it,62864,62899
163,He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship,63266,63318
164,He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are,63669,63747
165,He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin,64093,64154
166,"We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression and were never going to let that happen again."" ""And so when Trump basically signs up for Putins wish list thats bad enough",64396,64685
167,But then when hes cavalier – and Im not talking about basketball – when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons saying that oh he doesnt care if other countries get them; in fact you know if there were a nuclear war in East Asia if Japan got nuclear weapons if South Korea got nuclear weapons hey just go at it folks,64778,65091
168,He even said he wouldnt care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons,65276,65340
169,One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons to be able to stop proliferation,65593,65866
170,And now its even more important because its not only states that we have to worry about like North Korea; weve got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons,66064,66243
171,"The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesnt matter because it does."" ""I was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table",66459,66643
172,And what I learned – if you use diplomacy and youre tough about it you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program,66884,67024
173,And were going to make sure they follow it to the period the comma everything in that agreement,67286,67381
174,Im going to enforce,67710,67729
175,"And we still have challenges with Iran but I think were in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections."" ""So I know diplomacy can work because Ive done it and I know that – we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air takes them out on the ground and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people",67865,68377
176,Ive been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS and I have no doubt we will,68454,68554
177,And Donald says he has a secret plan,68842,68878
178,That he wont tell us about,69191,69217
179,"Well theres no secret; he has no plan."" ""And weve got to do more – weve got to do more to make sure we protect our country",69485,69607
180,We need the best intelligence we can get the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government,69868,69979
181,I will not rest,70295,70310
182,As a former Senator from New York on 9/11 I take this as a personal responsibility,70645,70727
183,"I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism."" ""And finally my friends weve got to bring our country back together",70978,71163
184,There is too much divisiveness too much finger-pointing and scapegoating,71462,71534
185,Our diversity is one of our strengths,71896,71933
186,We have to listen to each other,72300,72331
187,We dont have to agree; that is not required,72684,72727
188,But we need to be respectful,73081,73109
189,We need to listen,73480,73497
190,"And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work."" ""When I was First Lady Senator Secretary of State I worked to find common ground with everybody",73777,73930
191,I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids,74206,74348
192,When I was in the Senate I worked with practically every Republican I served with,74669,74750
193,And they all have nice things to say about me when Im not running for something,75076,75155
194,And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the ..,75453,75523
195,of that,75836,75843
196,And we had to get 13 Republicans and I worked tirelessly and we got them,76162,76234
197,We did that,76561,76572
198,"There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of."" ""So Im excited about the campaign but Im even more excited about getting to work for you – being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody",76781,77087
199,I mean that is how I was raised in my church and by my family and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice,77185,77357
200,And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you,77592,77664
201,And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate Tim Kaine – its right here – is real simple: I want you to know what we say were going to do because I want you to hold me accountable,77884,78089
202,I dont believe in bait and switch where I say oh were going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else,78264,78391
203,That kind of reminds you of somebody doesnt it? No heres what were going to try to do,78646,78731
204,Were going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations,79031,79125
205,And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class,79406,79513
