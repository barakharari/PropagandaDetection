13,Trump has declined to release his tax returns or even a summary of his returns breaking a practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades,5970,6162
14,Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr,6489,6573

58,Trump had no more than a few million dollars in his various bank accounts,25335,25408

60,Trump had bought Marla Maples an engagement ring estimated to be worth $250000,26146,26224
61,It is unclear who first glimpsed a way for Mr,26568,26613
62,Trump to dodge a huge tax bill,26982,27012
63,But the basic maneuver he used was essentially a new twist on a contentious strategy corporations had been using for years to avoid taxes created by canceled debt,27319,27481
64,"The strategy — known among tax practitioners as a ""stock-for-debt swap"" — relies on mathematical sleight of hand",27782,27894
65,Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan,28219,28287
66,If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income,28589,28750
67,Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience,29066,29122
68,The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay,29460,29542
69,This way it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt,29809,29958
70,Best of all it did not matter if the actual market value of the stock was considerably less than the $40 million in canceled debt,30199,30328
71,(Stock in an effectively insolvent company could easily be next to worthless.) Even in the opaque rarefied world of gaming impenetrable tax regulations this particular maneuver was about as close as a company could get to waving a magic wand and making taxes disappear,30583,30851
72,Alarmed by the obvious potential for abuse Congress and the I.R.S,31137,31202
73,made repeated efforts during the 1980s to curb this brand of tax wizardry before banning its use by corporations altogether in 1993,31542,31673
74,But while policy makers were busy trying to stop corporations from using this particular ploy the endlessly creative club of elite tax advisers was inventing a new way to circumvent the ban this time through the use of partnerships,31937,32168
75,This was the twist that was especially beneficial to Mr,32465,32520
76,Trump,32947,32952
77,Wealthy families like the Trumps often own real estate and other assets through partnerships rather than corporations,33364,33481
78,Mr,33892,33894
79,Trump for example owned all three of his Atlantic City casinos through partnerships an arrangement that allowed casino profits to flow directly to his personal tax returns when times were good,34261,34453
80,"""But what if times were bad? What if Mr",34788,34827
81,Trumps casino partnerships could not repay hundreds of millions of dollars they owed to bondholders? And what if the bondholders were persuaded to forgive this debt? Wouldnt that force the partnerships — i.e,35142,35349
82,Mr,35686,35688
83,"Trump — to report hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income in the form of canceled debt?"" Enter the tax advisers with their audacious plan: Why not eliminate all that taxable income from canceled debt by swapping ""partnership equity"" for debt in exactly the same way corporations had been swapping company stock for debt",35958,36287
84,True enough the I.R.S,36571,36592
85,and Congress had clearly signaled their disapproval of the basic concept,37019,37091
86,Fred T,37531,37537
87,Goldberg who was the I.R.S,37991,38017
88,commissioner under George Bush recalled in an interview that the I.R.S,38446,38516
89,frowned on partnership equity-for-debt swaps for the same reason it objected to corporate stock-for-debt swaps,38902,39012
90,"""The fiction is that the partnership interest has the same value as the debt"" he said",39371,39456
91,Lee A,39842,39847
92,"Sheppard a contributing editor to Tax Notes wrote in 1991 that trying to find a legal justification for this tactic was akin to proving ""the existence of the Loch Ness monster."" On the campaign trail Mr",40149,40351
93,Trump boasts of his mastery of tax loopholes and claims no other candidate for the White House has ever known more about the tax code,40596,40729
94,This background he argues with evident disgust gives him special insight into the way wealthy elites buy off politicians and hire high-priced lawyers and accountants to rig the tax system — just as he claims they rig elections,40995,41221
95,That insight was on display in 1991 and 1992 when he was laying the groundwork to make a multimillion-dollar tax bill disappear,41460,41587
96,Before proceeding with his plan Mr,41924,41958
97,Trump did what most prudent taxpayers do — he sought a formal tax opinion letter,42356,42436
98,Such letters typically written by highly-paid lawyers who spend entire careers mastering the roughly 10000 pages of ever-changing statutes that make up the United States tax code can provide important protection to taxpayers,42754,42978
99,As long as a tax adviser blesses a particular tax strategy in a formal opinion letter the taxpayer most likely will not face penalties even if the I.R.S,43249,43401
100,ultimately rules the strategy was improper,43750,43792
101,The language used in tax opinion letters has a specialized meaning understood by all tax professionals,44165,44267
102,"So for example when a tax lawyer writes that a shelter is ""more likely than not"" going to be approved by the I.R.S",44576,44690
103,this means there is at least a 51 percent chance the shelter will withstand scrutiny,45007,45091
104,"(This is known as an ""M.L.T.N."" letter in the vernacular of tax lawyers.) A ""should"" letter means there is about a 75 percent chance the I.R.S",45384,45526
105,will not object,45861,45876
106,"The gold standard a ""will"" letter means the I.R.S",46269,46318
107,is all but certain to bless the tax avoidance strategy,46678,46732
108,But the opinion letters Mr,47110,47136
109,Trump received from his tax lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher were far from the gold standard,47511,47606
110,The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr,47963,48075
111,Trumps tax gambit,48486,48503
112,"""Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority"" his lawyers wrote ""substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan."" One letter 25 pages long analyzed seven distinct components of Mr",48862,49106
113,Trumps proposed tax maneuver,49457,49485
114,"It found only ""substantial authority"" for six of the components",49902,49965
115,"In the stilted language of tax opinion letters the phrase ""substantial authority"" is a red flag that the lawyers believe the I.R.S",50327,50457
116,can be expected to rule against the taxpayer roughly two-thirds of the time,50794,50869
117,In other words Mr,51248,51265
118,Trumps tax lawyers were telling him there were at least six different reasons the I.R.S,51642,51729
119,would likely cry foul if he were audited,52084,52124
120,In anticipation of that possibility the lawyers even laid out a fallback plan that would have allowed Mr,52449,52553
121,Trump to spread the pain of a large tax hit over many years if the I.R.S,52868,52940
122,ultimately balked,53323,53340
123,"""It is unclear whether the I.R.S",53738,53770
124,ever challenged Mr,54161,54179
125,Trumps use of this specific tax maneuver,54582,54622
126,According to a financial disclosure statement prepared by Mr,55004,55064
127,Trumps accountants he was under audit by tax authorities as of 1993 only a year after he avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income because of this legally suspect tactic,55392,55587
128,"But the results of that audit are unknown and the agency declined to comment on Monday."" ""Regardless of whether the I.R.S",55868,55989
129,objected Mr,56368,56379
130,Trumps tax avoidance in this case violated a central principle of American tax law said Mr,56762,56852
131,"Buckley the former chief of staff for Congresss Joint Committee on Taxation who later served as chief tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee."" ""He deducted somebody elses losses"" Mr",57138,57344
132,Buckley said,57678,57690
133,By that Mr,58115,58125
134,Buckley means that only the bondholders who forgave Mr,58532,58586
135,Trumps unpaid casino debts should have been allowed to use those losses to offset future income and reduce their taxes,58940,59058
136,That Mr,59423,59430
137,Trump used the same losses to reduce his taxes ultimately increases the tax burden on everyone else Mr,59797,59899
138,Buckley explained,60255,60272
139,"""He is double dipping big time."" In any event Mr",60657,60705
140,Trump can no longer benefit from the same maneuver,61084,61134
141,Just as Congress acted in 1993 to ban stock-for-debt swaps by corporations it acted in 2004 to ban equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships,61534,61670
142,Among the members of Congress who voted to finally close the loophole: Senator Hillary Clinton of New York,62116,62222
