0,"""Ill cut to the chase: Our next president could fill up to three Supreme Court vacancies",0,88
1,"And theres no damn way we can entrust that responsibility to Donald Trump (or any of the other Republican candidates for that matter)."" The stakes are especially high for women if we let one of those guys into office—Trumps outrageous comments are proof of that",501,762
2,"In case you missed it he said abortion should be illegal and if a woman gets one ""there has to be some sort of punishment."" Let me repeat that:  ""He also made sure to point out that the only way abortion will be outlawed in America is if we elect a president like him wholl appoint anti-choice judges."" ""We cant let Donald Trump—or any of the other Republicans—anywhere near the Supreme Court",840,1231
3,These Republicans are the most terrifyingly extreme field of candidates Ive ever seen—and if one of them wins they could impose their views on women for decades to come via the justices theyll appoint,1372,1572
4,"Instead of heroes like Justices Sotomayor and Kagan we could have the next generation of Alitos and Thomases restricting our constitutional rights."" ""Theres only one person who can stop them from winning the White House: Hillary Clinton",1802,2038
5,Generations of women are counting on her—and counting on us to help elect her,2333,2410
6,"This election is way too important for us to let them down."" Before I came to work for Hillary Clinton I spent close to five years working for Planned Parenthood—a lot of that time in my home state of Texas",2676,2882
7,That work has had a profound impact on the way I see the stakes in this presidential election,3114,3207
8,During his time in office Governor Perry attacked womens health and Planned Parenthood,3552,3638
9,He cut funding for preventive care and screenings and signed laws like the demeaning mandatory ultrasound bill which forced women seeking an abortion in Texas to undergo a medically unnecessary ultrasound whether they wanted to or not,3972,4206
10,"And he signed House Bill 2 one of the nations toughest abortion restrictions—after saying that his ultimate goal was to make access to abortion at any stage ""a thing of the past."" Its hard to understate the impact of HB 2",4429,4650
11,Almost immediately after the law took effect Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast was overwhelmed with calls and women lined up outside to try and understand whether they would need to go somewhere else for their appointments,4860,5078
12,Doris Dixon a friend and the call center director for Planned Parenthood shared a heartbreaking account of a woman who traveled from out of state and stayed in Houston overnight only to learn she could no longer have a procedure that had been legal days before,5285,5545
13,"Doris wrote: ""I dont know what will happen to her",5792,5841
14,I dont know that I will ever stop thinking about her,6171,6223
15,"And she is just one woman whose life has been turned upside down by this law."" ""I thought the assault on womens rights and health care access couldnt get more egregious—or downright offensive",6509,6700
16,Enter Donald Trump,7050,7068
17,The Republican frontrunner just called for criminal action against women who have abortions,7488,7579
18,This is more than horrific rhetoric,7992,8027
19,"Its a shot across the bow."" ""Weve seen firsthand what happens when politicians put up barrier after barrier to stop women from getting the health care they need and health care providers in an already struggling state are forced to close their doors."" And Donald Trump has made it clear that if he is elected president what happened in Texas will play out across the country—and the consequences for women in America will be as disastrous as they have been in Texas",8203,8668
20,"""We cant let that happen",8843,8867
21,This is why we do what we do,9230,9258
22,This is why we fight,9617,9637
23,"And we need someone in the White House who will take up those fights alongside us."" ""Law and policy arent abstract issues or cheap campaign fodder",9934,10080
24,They affect peoples lives every day in big and small ways for better or worse,10383,10460
25,"And when candidates like Donald Trump call for criminalizing abortion it matters."" ""Trump may be leading the race to the bottom when it comes to womens health and rights but hes far from the only contestant",10738,10944
26,In the last five years alone lawmakers across the country have enacted 231 restrictions on abortion,11232,11331
27,These restrictions put quality affordable reproductive health care even further out of reach for women who already face the greatest obstacles to getting the care they need,11655,11827
28,"Its a vicious cycle."" At a time when we should be doing everything we can to break down barriers that hold people back and build ladders of opportunity in their place laws like these build even more hurdles for many already living on the margins and contribute to a culture of shame and stigma around abortion",12004,12313
29,And Donald Trump has made it clear that he would erect even more barriers—condemning us to a future in which the health care women need slips further and further out of reach every day,12473,12657
30,"""We cant let that happen",12960,12984
31,Affordable health care is a basic human right,13364,13409
32,"We have a responsibility to help all Americans realize that right—and not allow it to become a luxury reserved for those who can afford it."" ""Thats why we need to work to defend and expand the Affordable Care Act which covers 20 million more people—and level the health care playing field for women who can no longer be charged more for the same coverage because of our gender",13606,13982
33,Its why we need to do more to bring down out-of-pocket health care costs that are still an insurmountable hurdle for too many,14142,14267
34,"And its why we need to fight back against restrictions on womens health across the country—and stop them from ever becoming law in the first place."" ""Ive spent my career fighting for justice equality and opportunity",14527,14742
35,And Donald Trumps outrageous attack on women is about more than words—its about the very real harm his policies would cause to women across the nation and the disproportionate burden they will impose on low-income women rural women and women of color,14956,15206
36,This is a reproductive justice issue a human rights issue and an economic issue,15472,15551
37,"Most of all its an issue of fundamental justice and equality under the law—and these attacks from politicians like Donald Trump are an affront to everything we should be striving for as a country."" ""All of the Republican frontrunners for president want to make abortion illegal",15811,16088
38,"Now Donald Trump has said how hed enforce that prohibition: punishing women and doctors."" Donald Trump can try to distance himself from his comments all he wants",16325,16486
39,But we all heard what he said,16821,16850
40,"As Maya Angelou said ""When people show you who they are believe them."" Donald Trump keeps showing us who he is",17192,17302
41,We should believe him,17655,17676
42,"""But its important to remember that hes not alone",18066,18115
43,Donald Trump is just saying what Republican politicians across the country believe—everyone who has signed and voted for laws to defund Planned Parenthood force women to undergo invasive and medically unnecessary procedures before ending a pregnancy mandate that doctors recite misleading information to patients and shutter every abortion provider for miles,18416,18774
44,These are laws that are meant to shame women and block their access to health care,19051,19133
45,"Thats their purpose."" ""We dont need to imagine the consequences of these laws",19499,19576
46,"Its unfolding right before our eyes."" ""Right now the Supreme Court is weighing whether a Texas law imposing unnecessary expensive requirements on doctors who perform abortions will be allowed to stand",19906,20106
47,"Its the biggest challenge to "" "" in a generation",20432,20480
48,There are so few abortion providers in Texas that getting an abortion can mean taking time off work finding child care driving halfway across a state the size of France and spending a night in a hotel—any one of these things many women simply cant afford,20732,20986
49,"If the Supreme Court rules that this law is constitutional there could be just 10 abortion providers left in all of Texas—a place that 5.4 million women of reproductive age call home."" ""If you have to jump through multiple hoops to access a right its like not having that right at all",21128,21412
50,Its a privilege for the wealthy,21652,21683
51,And when politicians put up barriers that make it all but impossible for low-income women to get an abortion theyre jeopardizing womens health economic security and futures,22017,22189
52,"Thats just plain wrong."" ""I come to this issue as a woman a mother a grandmother and a former lawyer",22479,22579
53,I also come to it as a former First Lady and Secretary of State,22889,22952
54,On behalf of the United States I traveled to places where girls are married off as soon as theyre old enough to bear children because their worth is determined by their fertility and where the denial of family planning consigns women to lives of hardship,23187,23441
55,"I visited countries where governments have strictly regulated womens reproduction—either forcing women to have abortions or forcing women to get pregnant and give birth."" ""Everything Ive seen has convinced me that life is freer fairer healthier safer and far more humane when women everywhere are empowered to make their own reproductive decisions."" ""And everything Ive heard from Donald Trump and his fellow Republican candidates for president has convinced me that they have no regard for women or our ability to maintain autonomy over our own lives and futures."" ""They all want limited government—except when it comes to intruding on womens health."" ""Reproductive health and rights are a fundamental part of womens health and rights",23418,24153
56,And reproductive health includes abortion,24254,24295
57,"So defending womens health and rights means defending access to abortion—not just in principle but in practice."" ""In 1995 I traveled to Beijing for the Fourth U.N",24673,24835
58,World Conference on Women,25225,25250
59,I addressed human rights abuses in China—including violations of reproductive rights,25683,25767
60,The message of that conference still echoes around the world today: womens rights are human rights,26150,26248
61,"And reproductive rights are human rights too."" We need to repeal laws like the Hyde Amendment that make it harder for low-income women and disproportionately women of color to exercise their full reproductive rights",26558,26773
62,We need to fight against the erosion of rights at the state level where Republicans have signed laws designed to shame and coerce women and defund Planned Parenthood,27038,27203
63,We need to ensure that patients and staff are safe to walk into health centers without facing harassment bullying or violence,27500,27625
64,And we must always always stand with the brave women and men across our country who are as committed as ever to providing safe and legal abortion care even in places where that right is under concerted attack,27887,28095
65,"""Whenever politicians become involved in deciding whether when and how a woman becomes a mother its not just degrading—its dangerous",28357,28489
66,"Few decisions are more sacred or intensely personal and women deserve to make them for ourselves."" ""Heres the good news: While Donald Trump is a bully voters will have our say at the ballot box",28781,28974
67,So if you disagree with his comments youve got to vote,29374,29428
