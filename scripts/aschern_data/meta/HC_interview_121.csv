0,""" Were joined now by his ""  opponent former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton",0,77
1,She joins us now from Manchester as well,454,494
2,Madam Secretary thank you for joining us this morning,871,924
3,"So you have had your own turn on ""Saturday Night Live."" How did he do? "" Well I didnt get to see it but its always a fun experience",1265,1396
4,Im sure he did great,1666,1686
5,You know its a wonderful forum,1994,2024
6,Its a crash course in trying to figure out how to do live TV,2317,2377
7,"And I had a great time doing it."" "" We also had of course the Republican debate last night here at St",2646,2747
8,Anselms,3055,3062
9,And Marco Rubio called you out on the issue of abortion,3401,3456
10,"Take a look.""   "" Why doesnt the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal even on the due date of that unborn child? Why dont they ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that partial birth abortion which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country she thinks thats a fundamental right",3656,3992
11,"They are the extremists when it comes to the issue of abortion and I cant wait to expose them in a general election.""    Are you going to get exposed in a general election?  You know George I — its really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign",4098,4363
12,Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can,4590,4661
13,You know Ive been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion how it should be safe and legal and I have the same position that Ive had for a very long time,4918,5087
14,"But whats really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn ""Roe v",5297,5413
15,"Wade"" to defund Planned Parenthood to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme..",5691,5783
16, But are there any..,6124,6143
17, — and I — I think the Amer..,6495,6523
18," — restrictions you would accept on late-term abortions? "" Well you know Ive been on the record on this for a long time",6830,6948
19,You know I think that the life and health of the mother obviously rape and incest have to be always taken into account,7217,7335
20,And you know when he raises the you know very very difficult issue of late-term abortion he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons there are health-related reasons,7606,7793
21,Ive met women who have had to face this excruciating choice,8112,8171
22,This is not something that anyone that Ive ever met with enters into without the deepest thought the most careful consideration,8527,8654
23,And I remember at an event back in the 90s where you know we sat and talked with some of the women who had to make a very hard decision,8907,9042
24,"You know its — its just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of very difficult concerns.""  You..",9288,9434
25,""" And I dont think he should be allowed to get away with that."" "" You had your own debate with Bernie Sanders this week as well",9702,9829
26,And he challenged — you challenged him to come up with evidence that contributions from Wall Street ever influenced your positions,10100,10230
27,He and his team have circulated the charge from Elizabeth Warren who said you changed your position on the bankruptcy bill back in 2001 because of contributions,10536,10696
28,"Heres what Senator Warren had to say.""    One of the first bills that came up after she was Senator Clinton was the bankruptcy bill",10980,11108
29, And?  She voted in favor of it,11415,11444
30,She has taken money from the groups,11797,11832
31,And more to the point she worries about them as a constituency,12153,12215
32,"   How do you respond to that charge? "" Well Im glad you asked me about it because this is one of these you know innuendo insinuation charges that the Sanders campaign is engaging in.""  Well that was Senator Warren though",12472,12689
33,""" If you — no but — but I know",12935,12965
34,But if you had played the entire quote you know what you would have heard her say she and I worked together in 2000 to stop a bankruptcy bill that we both believed was very harmful,13205,13385
35,When I got to the Senate in 2001 one of the first big votes there was on a version of the bankruptcy bill and I was deluged by womens groups and childrens advocates groups to do everything I could to make sure that child support and womens precarious financial situation in case of divorce or not being able to get the kind of funding they needed from a partner or a spouse in bankruptcy would not be endangered,13462,13873
36,And it was,14062,14072
37,The current — that bill was making it a very low priority,14402,14459
38,So I did go to work on behalf of all these womens groups and childrens groups because they needed a champion,14748,14856
39,And I got that bill changed,15157,15184
40,"And in return it had nothing to do with any money whatsoever — and I resent deeply any effort by the Sanders campaign to so imply...""  But..",15481,15620
41, It had to do with trying to get a deal..,15892,15932
42,""" But thats not what..."" "" — that would protect women",16255,16308
43,But now let me finish George because this has been bandied about and I just want to set the record straight,16600,16707
44,And so then three years later part of the — part of what Senator — Senator Warren said you played,16982,17079
45,You didnt play the whole thing because weve been allies,17373,17428
46,I faced a tough decision and I stood up for women and children,17743,17805
47,I went to the Senate floor said that was exactly what I was doing,18112,18177
48,Then the bill did not pass,18493,18519
49,It never became law,18845,18864
50,And then when the next bill came up 2005 womens issues were taken care of because I had made that a point back in 2001,19150,19268
51,And so then I was against that bill,19551,19586
52,I didnt get a chance to actually vote against it because Bill was in the hospital having a heart procedure,19876,19982
53,But I put a statement out,20276,20301
54,I was against it,20649,20665
55,So Im happy to set this record straight,21018,21057
56,And I really want to once again call out the Sanders campaign which claims they like to run a positive campaign,21370,21481
57,But they have been quite artful in raising questions and trying to cast doubts about my record,21771,21865
58,"And I really am not going to sit and take it anymore —""  But Senator — "" I have a public record",22143,22237
59,I have never ever been influenced in a view or a vote by anyone who has given me any kind of money,22472,22570
60,"So Im just going to keep setting the record straight."" "" But in her book Senator Warren said the bill was essentially the same but Hillary Clinton — Hillary Rodham Clinton was not",22807,22986
61,Big banks were now part of Secretary Clintons consistency,23294,23351
62,She wanted their support,23721,23745
63,"They wanted hers including —"" "" George look I — look I have the greatest — I have the greatest respect for Senator Warren",24073,24194
64,As I said we did work together,24498,24528
65,I faced a choice,24862,24878
66,I could have said to the women who have been my advocates for 30 years Im sorry; Im now in the Senate,25167,25268
67,But you know I cant help you,25561,25589
68,Nobody else is helping them,25930,25957
69,They were desperate to get help,26301,26332
70,They were afraid that child support was going to be below credit card debt that they were going to be really left out and left behind and badly damaged,26617,26768
71,I could have said you know I cant do that because somebody in 10 years might say that you know something else is going on,27012,27133
72,Thats not the way I work,27414,27438
73,So they came to me; I said this is outrageous,27761,27806
74,I went to the floor,28140,28159
75,I lobbied to get a change,28500,28525
76,And as part of getting that change from both Democrats and Republicans who were leading that legislation they said if we change this bill at the last minute to take account of these issues youre raising about women and children which they had not clearly made a priority before I showed up then you know you have to say youll vote for it,28741,29078
77,It was — you know look thats what you have to do,29264,29312
78,I swallowed hard; I said OK,29603,29630
79,But it was also the case it didnt get passed,29917,29961
80,So I got what I needed into the bill,30251,30287
81,It stayed in the bill even in the bad version that I posed in 2005,30580,30646
82,"So thanks for the opportunity to set the record straight."" "" In the debate the other night you said youd look into whether or not to release the transcripts of your speeches to financial groups",30897,31090
83,"Have you made up your mind?"" "" Yes you know heres another thing I want to say",31349,31426
84,Let everybody whos ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them,31733,31829
85,Well all release them at the same time,32161,32199
86,You know I dont mind being the subject in Republican debates the subject in the Democratic primary,32538,32636
87,That kind of goes with the territory,32980,33016
88,Ive been around long enough,33395,33422
89,But at some point you know these rules need to apply to everybody,33778,33843
90,And there are a bunch of folks including you know my opponent whos given you know speeches to groups and people on the other side whove given speeches to groups,34127,34287
91,"Let — if this is now going to be a new standard so then it should apply to everybody and then Ill be happy to look into it further.""  Madam Secretary thanks very much for your time this morning",34543,34735
92, Great to talk to you George thanks,35121,35155
