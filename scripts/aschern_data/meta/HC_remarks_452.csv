0," ""Thank you so much! Wow it is great to be back in Cincinnati",0,60
1,What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river,433,494
2,I am grateful to all of you,867,894
3,I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby and with all of you because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes,1220,1395
4,"""Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? Ive known Ted a long time",1608,1756
5,He is a champion for workers and families,2033,2074
6,He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages,2415,2472
7,And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done breaking through the gridlock in Washington,2797,2911
8,"And this is important: unlike his opponent Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump."" I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials including my friend the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes from across the river in Kentucky",3125,3449
9,And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today,3690,3777
10,I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work to do everything they can to help save lives in America,4052,4192
11,You know as Gabby says every day when she goes out fight fight fight,4455,4523
12,And fight she does,4851,4869
13,She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together – to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children our fellow men and women our country,5146,5337
14,And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans including a majority of gun owners to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures,5567,5748
15,And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner,6051,6113
16,"""You know you go through life you go through the campaigns there are ups and there are downs",6443,6535
17,And my mother who had a really difficult life she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign,6815,6955
18,Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up,7255,7323
19,And throughout this campaign I have stayed focused on one thing: you – your lives your families the problems that keep you up at night,7636,7770
20,Because thats really what this election is all about,8083,8135
21,Its not about the noise and the distractions,8483,8527
22,"Its about what kind of country we want for our kids and what kind of president can help get us there."" I have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America",8774,8963
23,And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election,9183,9281
24,"""Now earlier today I was up at Kent State a great university and I told them about some of the reasons why I think its really important to get everybody out to vote in this election",9520,9701
25,But I started by saying that theres this new email story about – why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go,9891,10074
26,Thats a really good question,10343,10371
27,But I want you to know – look Ive said repeatedly I made a mistake Im not making any excuses but I will tell you this,10662,10779
28,If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers by all means go ahead look at them,11002,11099
29,And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year right? It wasnt even a close call and I think most people have moved on,11324,11495
30,"Theyre looking and focused on okay who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?"" Did any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well I am – I got a little bit of a chance",11691,11891
31,I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job,12106,12221
32,But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service my plans for our country what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do and then weigh that against my opponent what hes done and said,12417,12647
33,I am running against someone who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons,12860,12950
34,"He actually said ""Then why are we making them?"" He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons",13269,13364
35,Hes mentioned Japan South Korea even Saudi Arabia,13717,13766
36,Now if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas remember this,14108,14222
37,"When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy Donald Trump said he didnt need to consult because and I quote ""I have a very good brain."" He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do",14458,14659
38," "" No Donald you dont",14927,14947
39,"And of course the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia Vladimir Putin and their allies."" ""So in these last days lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election",15221,15501
40,"Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief."" ""I have to tell you it does not give me any pleasure saying that",15715,15904
41,Its not a small thing,16230,16251
42,I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president both Republicans and Democrats,16613,16715
43,And look Ive had my disagreements with Republicans,17051,17101
44,I might have disagreed on policies or principles but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office,17438,17544
45,Donald Trump is different and thats why there is so much at stake in this election,17862,17944
46,He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart,18278,18357
47,Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war,18645,18821
48,"But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together."" ""I will tell you this",19039,19192
49,I want to bring not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents people who vote for me and people who vote against me together,19449,19579
50,Because I have a very different vision of America,19925,19974
51,Instead of dark and divisive its hopeful and inclusive,20348,20402
52,Its big-hearted not small-minded,20796,20828
53,It is about lifting people up not putting them down,21201,21252
54,Its a vision that says and I believe this with all my heart we are stronger together,21592,21676
55,And America is great because America is good,22012,22056
56,Never forget that,22429,22446
57,Yes we have our flaws; of course were only humans,22808,22857
58,But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world,23140,23314
59,So we want an America where women are respected – where our veterans are honored – where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly,23563,23714
60,And we believe in an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong,24008,24090
61,An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts everyone has a place and the American dream is big enough for everybody,24384,24539
62,"So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher."" ""When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security I was really struck",24764,24956
63,It was a very big crowd and it was primarily students,25220,25273
64,And I thought to myself well Im not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security,25569,25708
65,And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys,25968,26088
66,A launch officer,26422,26438
67,"And he came out for me along with now more than 30 launch officers and basically they said we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never ever be near the nuclear codes and keys."" And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother him",26702,26962
68,"""Good luck",27231,27241
69,"Enjoy yourselves folks"" is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia",27585,27673
70,"I wonder if he even knows that a single – a single – nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should and I quote ""not have his finger on the button."" And when it comes to handling a crisis weve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation – when hes gotten a tough question from a reporter or when hes challenged in a debate or when he sees a protestor at a rally when hes confronted by his own words",27757,28304
71,So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis,28392,28446
72," "" Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin",28753,28835
73,I hope youll think about that when you cast your vote in this election,29134,29204
74,"Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren."" ""And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America",29424,29718
75,As Gabby knows so well 33000 Americans a year are killed guns,29970,30031
76,Thousands more are injured,30393,30419
77,Its an average of 90 people a day dying,30791,30830
78,Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes,31182,31249
79,We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters little children killed in their classrooms clubgoers massacred in Orlando nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston South Carolina,31558,31753
80,And weve seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence which is now the leading cause of death for young black men,32035,32181
81,And when we think about that we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others,32449,32550
82,"Ive had the great honor of getting to know their mothers who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement."" ""But heres what I want to say",32821,32984
83,If anything else in our country were killing as many people people of good faith people who believe like we do in the Second Amendment people who own guns people who go hunting people who are collectors we would say hey wait a minute,33178,33411
84,This cant go on,33685,33700
85,We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole close the online loophole,34063,34159
86,And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time,34438,34654
87,And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists,34927,34989
88,"If you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun period."" ""And look",35295,35380
89,There is a very clear difference,35684,35716
90,Donald Trump wont stand up to the gun lobby,36052,36095
91,Hes sold out to them,36438,36458
92,In fact the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group more than $7 million in Ohio alone,36760,36889
93,And in return Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obamas actions to strengthen criminal background checks,37186,37301
94,Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol,37657,37724
95,Hes even said on his very first day in office he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms,38066,38197
96,"How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?"" ""So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years which is why they are running all of these ads against me",38430,38599
97,And I will stand up to them as president,38865,38905
98,"I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because weve got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives."" ""I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top",39095,39474
99,Thats how I was raised,39659,39681
100,I was raised to believe that if you work hard – and I believe in hard work – you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America,39956,40090
101,And I will never ever quit on you,40336,40369
102,When I tell you Im going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life I dont care what the political or other barriers are,40634,40784
103,Were going to find a way over under around or through until we get it done,41041,41115
104,Ive been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and Im not stopping now,41419,41502
105,Remember when our opponents go low we go high,41832,41877
106,Were not going to be distracted,42227,42258
107,Were not going to be knocked off course,42603,42642
108,We know how much this election matters,42999,43037
109,"And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count."" ""Now the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple",43343,43505
110,Theyve announced it,43821,43840
111,Their strategy is: get women to stay home get young people to stay home and get people of color to stay home,44176,44284
112,Its all part of his scorched-earth campaign but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it,44546,44687
113,And it goes against everything we stand for,44968,45011
114,So if youre as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run the things he has said insulting not just women but immigrants Latinos African Americans prisoners of war Muslims veterans the military – I mean the list goes on and on,45263,45492
115,"Its almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does."" ""So you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history",45673,45885
116,We need more Americans to vote,46141,46171
117,And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because were already seeing record turnout,46492,46616
118,Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election,46931,46994
119,And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio,47331,47387
120,There is no doubt if we vote we win,47729,47764
121,So please if you havent voted early please do so,48104,48152
122,And please get your friends and your family everybody you know to vote,48467,48537
123,Take people to vote with you,48875,48903
124,"Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there."" ""Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun",49235,49370
125,And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because make no mistake whatever issue you care about – Ive only mentioned a few tonight but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot,49635,49849
126,Now it may be my name and my opponents name but where we stand on these issues what weve done in the past what we have said we want to do in the future that is all on the ballot,50020,50197
127,The future of our economy is at stake of our education system is at stake,50423,50496
128,Fighting climate change and clean renewable-energy jobs are at stake,50816,50884
129,LGBT equality is at stake,51224,51249
130,Equal pay for women is at stake,51606,51637
131,Actually in the end the American dream itself is at stake,51981,52038
132,"So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th.""  Happy",52354,52424
133,""" Happy",52742,52749
134,I think thats the right answer,53087,53117
135,But just suppose just suppose you go to bed early,53434,53483
136,Suppose you go to bed early,53794,53821
137,Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didnt make calls or knock on doors,54120,54199
138,I want you to imagine,54494,54515
139,So you get up early on the morning of the 9th,54807,54852
140,"And you log on to the news to find out hey whats going on or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio and you hear.""  No! ""I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what were for not what were against",55018,55289
141,But I also think its prudent to imagine what could happen if we dont do our part,55464,55544
142,"And when in the future somebody asks you maybe your kids or your grandkids What did you do when everything was on the line? I want you to be able to say I voted for a better fairer stronger America."" ""Lets go out and in these next eight days do everything we can to make it clear were going after the kind of future that includes everybody",55703,56042
143,Were going to build this economy: new jobs rising wages,56238,56293
144,Were going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt,56618,56695
145,We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids,56977,57093
146,So if we build that future together we will be able to say we were part of making sure that Americas best days are still ahead of us,57368,57500
147,"And we will prove once and for all that love trumps hate."" Thank you all."" ",57862,57936
