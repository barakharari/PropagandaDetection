Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.n ""Now he kept saying a lot of unusual things didnt he? And you know theres a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States",6129,6879
16,And I did practice my composure,6876,6907
17,People said to me well how did you do that? The things he was saying,7229,7297
18,And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you,7592,7677
19,I said well I did practice,7991,8017
20,And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me,8325,8405

24,For example as First Lady I helped create the Childrens Health Insurance Program which covers eight million kids,9833,9945
25,And these are families that theyre not poor families theyre working people but they dont make enough money and they dont work for somebody who provides insurance and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had,10204,10466
26,I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf and the doctor said Were sorry theres really nothing we can do for her,10660,10812
27,But this mother like many mothers I know did not take that for an answer right? She got on the internet,11066,11169
28,She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter but they were expensive and she and her husband didnt have that kind of money and they didnt have insurance,11404,11626
29,She was at her doctors office and just so distraught and the doctor said Well theres this new thing called the Childrens Health Insurance Program,11856,12001
30,Maybe you should look into it,12333,12362
31,Turned out she was eligible,12738,12765
32,She signed up,13145,13158
33,She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have by the way,13486,13605
34,"And when I was in North Carolina I heard about her and I got to meet her but more than that I met her daughter who talked to me and who just graduated from college – because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.n"" ""Ill tell you what that is how I judge my last 30 years",13740,14048

36,I saw it,14597,14605
37,And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it – our police our firefighters our EMTs,14876,15068
38,And Ill tell you who else we got covered,15348,15388
39,We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools and I see one right out there who knows exactly what Im talking about,15690,15831
40,All across the city people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger,16126,16207
41,That was America at its best,16544,16572
42,And dont ever forget what we are capable of being who we are,16917,16977

47,Thats why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election it is a choice between two very different visions for America,18762,18978
48,Ive got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America I dont recognize the country hes talking about,19199,19303
49,It is so dark so divisive so hateful,19627,19663
50,That is not the America that I believe in,20012,20053
51,I believe that we should have a confident optimistic inclusive vision of where were going and how were going to get there,20366,20487
52,I love our country and I believe in the American people,20790,20845
53,And I think theres nothing we cant achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them,21150,21255
54,You see we believe in an America that is bighearted not small-minded,21549,21617
55,We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part,21921,22004
56,And we believe America is great because America is good,22307,22362
57,Never forget that,22704,22721

62,Well let me tell you this,24498,24523
63,Change is inevitable,24861,24881
64,There will be change,25218,25238
65,The question is what kind of change are we going to have?n Are we going to build a stronger fairer better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not,25512,25692
66,"That is not the America that I believe we are.n ""And so here is what I want to ask you to do",25905,25997
67,I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors,26266,26335

70,In fact I dont know,27447,27466

74,I know,28992,28998
75,I understand that,29367,29384
76,I mean I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before its too late,29712,29790
77,But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine imagine January 20th 2017,30089,30163
78,And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol,30486,30567
79,Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively,30866,31096
80,"Now the truth is we really dont have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done both in his career and in this campaign tells you what could happen.n"" ""Now Michelle Obama who says so many wise and wonderful things she said the presidency doesnt change who you are; it reveals who you are",31246,31565

83,What is he talking about? Im proud that President Obama saved the auto industry,32531,32610
84,And Im even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest the U.S,32909,33023
85,"auto industry just had its best year ever.n"" ""If Donald wins the election wed have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States",33273,33449
86,We are a country founded on religious freedom,33746,33791
87,That runs contrary to our Constitution,34159,34197
88,We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair,34518,34652
89,He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities,34936,35099
90,He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field,35388,35514
91,"I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony dont you?n"" ""Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins",35777,35932
92,Decades ago she was a hard-working nurse in New York City,36233,36290
93,She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent,36648,36710
94,But Donald Trump and his father Fred turned her away,37053,37105
95,You see whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments their application was marked with a C C for colored,37416,37533
96,And that didnt sit very well with Mae so she went to the authorities and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination,37825,37976
97,And although they settled they wouldnt change,38291,38336
98,So the government had to take them back to court,38689,38737
99,Thats a pattern,39108,39123
100,This is what happens time and time again with my opponent,39496,39553
101,If he were to win he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department,39879,39952
102,"If he doesnt respect all Americans now how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?n"" ""He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution",40234,40385
103,He doesnt seem to understand the rule of law that we really are a nation of laws not men,40652,40740
104,Heres the latest example,41063,41087
105,There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City,41421,41477
106,It was called the Central Park Five,41806,41841
107,Maybe some of you have heard of it,42182,42216
108,There were five black and Latino kids some as young as 14,42554,42611
109,They were wrongfully convinced and they were in prison where they spent years,42935,43012
110,Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids,43351,43429
111,And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime Trump actually said they should still be in prison,43739,43891
112,It doesnt matter if youre innocent,44206,44240
113,If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up,44599,44668
114,"No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin because thats exactly what Putin does to his people.n"" ""So we cant trust him with our Constitution",44965,45099
115,We cant trust him to obey the rule of law,45379,45420
116,He has shown us who he is,45742,45767
117,Now we have to decide who we are,46092,46124
118,So let me paint you a different picture,46441,46480
119,"Here is what were going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.n"" ""We have three big challenges",46771,46883
120,Number one we got to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top,47170,47253

122,Number three weve got to bring our country together,47989,48040
123,We have got to overcome these divides,48401,48438
124,We have to heal our nation,48819,48845
125,"And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.n"" ""I have said repeatedly that were going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back it can lead to holding other people back",49120,49348

127,A church in Mississippi was burned this week,50037,50081
128,Someone painted Vote Trump on the side and then set it on fire,50421,50483
129,We cant let – we cant let that happen,50829,50866
130,What happened in Flint Michigan should not be normal or acceptable,51207,51273
131,Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water,51599,51654
132,Those are basics,52002,52018
133,"Weve got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.n"" ""And its important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II – infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy technology",52260,52582
134,Some people say we cant do that,52837,52868
135,Well Im telling you theyre wrong,53261,53293
136,Theyre wrong,53698,53710
137,We have the best workers the most productive workers,54107,54159
138,Were going to give them more to work on more products to produce,54539,54603
139,And were going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities,54929,55035
140,And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America,55382,55443
141,"That means were going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.n"" ""And were going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers no matter what zip code that child lives in",55717,55990
142,And I want to start with our youngest kids with pre-kindergarten programs,56231,56304
143,And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers,56623,56677
144,Weve got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children,57009,57082
145,"And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.n"" ""Itll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other",57306,57602
146,I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law,57814,57911
147,"And thats what were going to work for.n"" ""Were also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives",58200,58322

150,"We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that weve got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them in the first place.n"" ""And while we create more safe communities we want to invest in those communities",59317,59561
151,I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done one named Clinton one named Obama,59795,59911
152,And I want to be a really strong partner,60232,60272
153,Ill compete a little with them,60621,60651

155,Thats why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage because people who work full time should not be left in poverty,61338,61463
156,And isnt it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a womens issue,61747,61832
157,If you have a wife a mother a daughter or a sister who works its your issue,62117,62192
158,Its a family issue,62522,62540
159,And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare paid family leave equal pay for women the other side accuses me of playing the womens card,62838,62993

161,I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues,63606,63708
162,And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate,63946,64122
163,So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125000 a year,64328,64473
164,And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you dont go into debt,64735,64809
165,And for people who already have student debt were going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it,65073,65192
166,"And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.n"" ""Now this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election",65380,65678

168,I get that,66305,66315
169,I understand that,66698,66715
170,We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in 08 and 09,67061,67135
171,Millions of people lost their jobs millions lost their homes family wealth was wiped out,67465,67553
172,That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that,67870,67951
173,I get it,68284,68292
174,But I learned a long time ago from my late mother anger is not a plan,68613,68682
175,Right? Be angry vent about it and then roll up your sleeves and get to work,68957,69032
176,Thats what I will do,69330,69350
