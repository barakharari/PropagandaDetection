0,""" Were joined right off the bat by Democratic candidate for president and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton."" Madam Secretary thanks so much for joining us",0,163
1,On Saturday you called for new sanctions against Iran for its ballistic missile program,617,704
2,That prompted a response from another American who was once held prisoner in Iran Shane Bauer one of the hikers released in 2011,1067,1195
3,"He had some tough words for you on Twitter writing—quote—""Seriously why would Hillary call for more sanctions now? As far as we know four of the Americans are still in Iran",1465,1637
4,"Totally irresponsible""—unquote",1985,2015
5,"He also said whenever he was in Iran whenever he heard your voice his heart would sink because—quote—""All she ever does with Iran is inflame tensions."" I want to give you awe chance to respond",2332,2524
6, Well look I appreciate what he went through when he was held prisoner in the infamous Iranian prison,2794,2894
7,And we were very happy that we were able to get him and the two other hikers back home,3172,3258
8,But we have a very clear path we are pursuing with Iran,3550,3605
9,I am pleased that we do have an agreement that is being implemented,3907,3974
10,And I was part of putting that in place by getting the sanctions imposed on Iran that the entire world went along with,4259,4377
11,But we also have made it clear from the beginning that their missile activity is still subject to sanction,4677,4783
12,That is part of the overall approach that the administration has taken toward Iran and that I support,5092,5193
13,"""So when we became aware of missile activity that is under U.N",5524,5586
14,"supervision and is prohibited it would be a mistake not to make clear to Iran that we are very very happy to see us implementing the agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program and the way that they have complied but that doesnt mean they can now go off and invest and test a lot of missiles that would eventually be able to be intercontinental that could reach the United States and maybe carry a very dangerous weapon."" ""So I think there might be a misunderstanding of what our whole agreement consists of because certainly I have made clear Im proud of the role that I played in getting that agreement in place but as president I will enforce it."" And there have to be consequences if Iran veers away from what it has agreed to or what it has been mandated to do or prohibited from doing by the international community",5539,6370
15,""" Lets turn to politics obviously a big night tonight a Democratic debate."" You will be facing off with Bernie Sanders in this new more contentious phase of the election with just a week and a—two weeks and a day until the Iowa caucuses",6245,6481
16,One of your top allies David Brock is calling on Bernie Sanders to release his medical records,6713,6807
17,"The Sanders campaign—campaign manager Jeff Weaver he called this—quote—""one of the most desperate and vile attacks imaginable."" ""Whos right there David Brock or Jeff Weaver? ""  "" Well I dont know anything about it but I have released my medical records."" ""And I remember being asked frequently for me to do so",7059,7367
18,"And so obviously thats you know something I will leave up to the Sanders campaign."" But this is a spirited debate because although we share some very similar goals for our country we have differences",7531,7730
19,And Senator Sanders has been pointing them out,8031,8077
20,"""One of my biggest differences has been on guns",8456,8503
21,And Im very pleased that he flip-flopped on the immunity legislation,8882,8950
22,Now I hope he will flip-flop on what we call the Charleston loophole and join legislation to close that because its been a key argument of my campaign that we Democrats in fact Americans need to stand up to the gun lobby and pass comprehensive commonsense gun measures that will make America safer,9192,9489
23,"And thats what I intend to do.""  One of your major lines of attack against Bernie Sanders in addition to the gun one that you just leveled has been on his proposal for single-payer health care",9651,9842
24,Back in 1994 you said a single-payer system administrated by the states would actually lower health care costs,10115,10225
25,Take a listen,10604,10617
26,   Single-payer would have lower costs,11024,11059
27,And one of the reasons that the president has a provision in his approach that guarantees states can go single-payer is to permit states that are able to do that to start down the single-payer road,11377,11574
28,   Now I know that was a long time ago but you said in the Q&A single-payer would not be politically feasible,11813,11919
29,"In a perfect world do you believe that single-payer would ultimately lower health care costs? "" Well I believe in universal health care",12211,12346
30,And I think we have now finally after many decades of efforts thanks to President Obama a plan that will get us to universal health care,12629,12765
31,Its the Affordable Care Act,13072,13099
32,So Im not interested in what the Republicans are trying to do which is to repeal it as they consistently vote to do,13417,13532
33,And I also think it would be a mistake to really thrust our country into another contentious national debate about how were going to provide quality affordable health care to everybody,13795,13979
34,"So Im...""  Right but just on the merits",14284,14322
35, ..,14716,14718
36,very focused on—well the merits are we need to get to universal health care,15107,15182
37,That is the merit,15549,15566
38,"""The merit is how do we get to universal health care where everybodys covered where everybody can afford it? We have had some experimentation with states",15899,16052
39,Actually Vermont tried to do single-payer,16400,16441
40,"They found that the cost and the taxes that were required were prohibitive."" ""Colorado now has a referendum on its ballot so its going to also pursue it",16779,16931
41,Im a big believer in letting states experiment,17229,17275
42,"But when it comes to where we are right now in 2016 Im going to defend protect and improve the Affordable Care Act."" "" For years you have been very protective of your daughter Chelsea Clinton especially when she was a child of course and now shes a grown woman."" ""This week she surprised a lot of people when she unleashed one of the most scathing attacks of the cycle accusing Bernie Sanders of wanting to empower Republican governors who might then cut peoples health care."" PolitiFact called Chelseas remarks mostly false",17403,17927
43,Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said it was not an honest attack,18060,18127
44,"And liberal columnist Mark Shields said the attack turned your daughter into a—quote—""political hack."" Do you think it was a mistake to muddy up Chelsea like that?  Look she was asked a question",18449,18642
45,I love my daughter,18951,18969
46,And she answered a question,19356,19383
47,"""And all I can say Jake is that the only health plan we know of from Senator Sanders is whats described in the legislation that he has introduced nine times in the Congress in the Senate",19663,19849
48,"And it does turn all of the programs we know of that provide health care over to the states."" ""The federal government would provide a big portion of the cost but states would be mandated to also pay considerably about 14 percent of the cost",20027,20267
49,"Thats whats in his bill."" ""So I think anyone who wants to compare and contrast since we dont have any more current plan from Senator Sanders has to look at the legislation that he introduced."" ""And yes if it were going to be state-run then governors Republican and Democrat alike would bear responsibility for appropriating the funds and administrating it according to Senator Sanders own legislative proposals.""  So no regrets about using Chelsea that way? "" Oh I didnt use her",20332,20809
50,"She answered a question."" And you know she gave a factual answer based on the legislation that is the only way we know what Senator Sanders is actually proposing because he introduced it nine times in the Congress",20897,21110
51,""" OK",21404,21408
52,"PolitiFact said it was mostly false but lets move on."" A new movie opened this weekend",21773,21859
53,"Its called ""13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" Its a cinematic version of a book a nonfiction book telling the story of the six private security contractors who defended the U.S",22138,22324
54,Consulate in Benghazi Libya from an attack by Islamic militants,22621,22684
55,"Are you planning to see it at all? "" Im just too busy campaigning",23009,23074
56,"I am still very focused on making sure we do everything we can as I did when I was secretary of state as I testified to over 11 hours to make sure that nothing like that happens again insofar as we are able to prevent it."" ""And thats my focus when it comes to the continuing obligation that the United States government has whenever we send anyone into harms way."" "" Lets talk about ISIS",23212,23599
57,"Its a big concern among many Americans."" I know that youre very reluctant to criticize President Obama and I understand that",23754,23878
58,"But I want to ask you about the situation in Syria on the ground because Anne-Marie Slaughter who is the former director of policy planning at the State Department under you she told me on my show ""THE LEAD that if President Obama had listened to you about arming the Syrian moderates years ago theres a—quote—""very good chance that we would not be facing ISIS like we are now."" Do you agree?  Well we will never know the answer to that question",24012,24456
59,"""Obviously I thought at the time it was the right approach",24610,24668
60,"And I advocated for it along with then Secretary Panetta and CIA Director Petraeus because I was worried about what would happen if there were a very vicious civil war when on one side you had Assads army backed by Iran and now we know also backed by Russia against a group of people who wanted more freedom wanted to live in dignity not the continuing oppression from the Assad regime that it would be a pretty uneven match to be understating that and it could open territory for terrorist groups foreign fighters and others to come in."" ""So lets talk about where we are now",24752,25327
61,"And I have laid out a plan to deal with ISIS about airpower that is being used now with more nations joining the United States which is in the lead to try to go after ISIS leadership infrastructure other assets also to support Iraqi and Syrian fighters who are on the ground trying to take territory back from ISIS and what else we need to do to build up those forces the Iraqi army which has had some success taking back Ramadi Sunni tribal fighters which we have to get back into the fight and that is beginning to happen and supporting the Kurdish fighters who have been extraordinary brave on both sides of the border by helping to equip and support them."" So we have a clear mission to deprive ISIS of territory",25095,25811
62,And there is some movement positive movement on that,25835,25887
63,And then we have to cut off their foreign fighters their foreign funding and take them online—take them on online so that they are no longer able to recruit and propagandize which keeps their flow of fighters and money coming,26172,26397
64,""" Im told were out of time",26676,26702
65,"I just have one last question for you."" In terms of the status of the FBI investigation into your private e-mail server have you been interviewed by the FBI yet?  No",27002,27166
66,""" You havent."" All right Secretary Clinton thanks so much",27578,27635
67,Really appreciate your time,28052,28079
68,Good luck with the debate tonight,28496,28529
69, Thanks,28946,28952
