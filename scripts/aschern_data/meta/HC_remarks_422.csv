72,Their parents their grandparents were not around,28212,28260
73,And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old,28581,28696
74,Hes only lived in the United States,29016,29051

90,My father was a factory worker,35270,35300

""Now this is all allegedly because of course we dont know for sure because he wont release his income taxes but its allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos",37019,37423
96,"Now I ask you who loses $1 billion running casinos right?"" ""Do you know how hard that is? But think about it it means hes contributed zero",37558,37696
97,"Zero for our military zero for our vets zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military."" He calls the United States military a disaster",37944,38122
98,Well the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America,38334,38520

102,"No truth to it but you know he did say it over and over again and weve slowly but surely uncovered how little hes done to help anybody except Donald Trump."" And he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings",39842,40048
103,Not American steel,40335,40353
104,He could be buying American steel he should be buying American steel,40728,40796
105,If he wants to make America great again start by America with American steel,41149,41225
106,"""I have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure which uses American steel were going to do more on advanced manufacturing on technology and innovation on clean energy jobs and were going to make the economy fairer at the same time",41488,41743
107,"And heres what I want the young people and their families to hear."" Senator Sanders and I got together on a plan",41974,42086

118,"Right? You know that."" ""So Donald Trump always says you know Im playing the woman card",46475,46561

124,And I didnt know why,48803,48823
125,He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didnt know that,49155,49214

130,"We have dug ourselves out of that ditch thanks to everybodys hard work.""

""And Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street",50888,51213
131,He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which returns money to people whove been defrauded by big companies,51366,51497
132,"Well I have a totally different view."" ""Were gonna keep those and then were going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to theyre gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny every penny of tax benefit theyve ever gotten.""

144,"Im going to double - Im going to double the child tax credit.""

164,And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids,63970,64045
165,"And the reason I did that is because of my own mother."" ""I didnt know it when I was just a little girl but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own and then at the age of eight holding her little three-year-old sisters hand she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents."" ""It turned out the grandparents didnt really want her either",64146,64589
166,So by the age of 14 she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter,64707,64780
167,But heres what I want you to know,65090,65123
168,It sounds pretty harsh,65448,65470

171,"I think my mom who lived to the wonderful age of 92 I dont think there was a day that went by that she didnt think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own."" But along the way people were kind to her",66404,66642
172,People helped her,66891,66908
173,The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school so she said to her Dorothy if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school,67121,67422
174,"""Now youll have to come right back home",67602,67641
175,"That might sound kind of unfortunate but for my mom it was a gift because she really wanted to go to high school."" And so my mother always cared about other people",67911,68074
176,And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else right,68324,68410
177,And we need to show each other more kindness and support,68733,68789
