9,She raised her hand at a town hall and she said My twin sister cant speak,3603,3676
10,Because of that they put her in a separate class apart from the rest of the kids,3962,4042
11,But she can communicate with a computer,4353,4392
12,And shes very smart and would do just as well as anyone else if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance,4691,4810
13,"I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl – her confidence and how much she loved her sister."" ""So Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years",5056,5213

21,"This is something we could all use more of right now."" ""Im here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone but first I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days",8091,8324
22,First an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa,8565,8657

24,"Im sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well."" ""There is still much we dont know about what happened in both incidents",9329,9488
25,But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,9721,9847
26,Its unbearable,10189,10203
27,"And it needs to become intolerable."" ""We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week",10582,10690
28,And last night in Charlotte 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scotts death,11070,11176
29,Every day police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage honor and skill,11549,11648
30,We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota,12018,12089
31,Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right,12460,12516
32,And they likely saved a lot of lives,12889,12925
33,Ive spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed as I am to reform,13232,13373
34,Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers,13664,13753
35,"We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities."" ""Ive also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children and young people who feel that as far as their countrys concerned their lives seem disposable",14010,14270
36,Weve got to do better,14547,14568

47,Well I hope so,18675,18689
48,I hope so,19039,19048
49,I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that in America every person no matter what you look like who you are who you love you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you,19295,19532
50,"And that is the basic bargain that made our country great and its our job to make sure its there for you and future generations."" ""Building an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top is the central challenge of our time",19666,19903

55,And history has shown us – our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive broad-based growth – when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards,21679,21877
56,"""Now here is just one example",22184,22213
57,The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth,22570,22709
58,But as womens labor participation has slowed in recent years due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare so our economic growth wasnt as strong as it could have been,22991,23216
59,Women who want to work deserve to work,23507,23545
60,And whenever they are denied that opportunity its not fair to them – and we all lose out,23886,23974
61,In a competitive 21st century global economy we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines,24269,24363
62,"When we leave people out or write them off we not only shortchange them and their dreams we shortchange our country and our own futures."" ""Thats one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents",24632,24839
63,Its one reason why Im such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform,25152,25233
64,Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base,25570,25738
65,It is estimated if we did this despite what you hear from the other side we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years,26003,26161
66,"Now we need that."" ""Its also one reason why weve got to break down barriers of systemic racism including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations",26421,26598
67,Thats part of building an inclusive economy too,26911,26958
68,And its why I believe we need to do more to help young people who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again,27261,27455
69,"And weve got to help older Americans whove displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy."" ""And too often training and retraining doesnt work as it should",27707,27879
70,If you dont have a four-year degree if you havent really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years its hard to just make a course correction,28151,28302
71,We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers,28574,28717
72,"Whether youre trying to start your career or youve spent decades contributing to our economy you deserve better."" ""Now these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy and Im going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because weve actually put in one place all of our plans",28907,29210
73,You see we have this old-fashioned idea if were asking you to support us we should tell you what were going to do,29372,29485
74,Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasnt gotten enough attention,29771,29850
75,It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible overlooked and undervalued who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it,30129,30284
76,"Now thats been true for a long time and we have to change it."" ""Im talking about people with disabilities men and women boys and girls who have talents skills ideas and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else",30485,30717
77,Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country,30947,31097
78,And right now in too many ways we are falling short,31387,31438
79,Weve got to face that and do better for everyones sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans,31715,31837
80,"I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency."" ""I want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people",32069,32236
81,And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known,32508,32566
82,Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability,32908,32960
83,Now some of those disabilities are highly visible some much harder to notice,33308,33384

87,Theyre veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe,35153,35248
88,Theyre working in the White House,35656,35689
89,Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf,36053,36159
90,So when world leaders come to the White House the person who greets them is Leah,36470,36550
91,"Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone."" ""And Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns",36864,37017
92,I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities and theyre doing phenomenal work,37343,37441
93,Im grateful to them every single day,37835,37871
94,"And people all over America would say the same about their boss their colleague their employee their family member with a disability."" ""Now over the past few days our country has taken leaps forward not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities but in making long-overdue changes in our schools workplaces and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life",38093,38498
95,Even so not that long ago if you had a disability – if you couldnt see couldnt walk lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue – that one fact was allowed to define your entire life,38618,38825
96,Because of that and that alone the world was closed to you,39074,39132
97,Not all of it and not for everyone but for most people basic essential things that others could do you couldnt and never would,39419,39545
98,"And that was that."" ""I saw this for myself as Anastasia said years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Childrens Defense Fund",39791,39948
99,One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids werent in school,40218,40306
100,We looked at census tract numbers and we said okay,40627,40677
101,How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers and thered be a gap,40969,41105
102,And we would say wait a minute,41401,41431
103,"Where are the kids? Why arent they in school?"" ""I went door to door along with people across our country going into different communities",41748,41885
104,I was in New Bedford Massachusetts,42197,42231
105,We saw a notable disparity there and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities,42562,42691
106,There were kids who were hard of hearing kids with intellectual disabilities,43021,43097
107,I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart curious desperate to go to school,43438,43528
108,But that chair held her back,43882,43910
109,Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms,44270,44319
110,Most teachers and aides werent trained to help her,44671,44721
111,So she didnt get to go,45063,45085
112,It felt like the world had said to her sorry kid,45419,45467
113,Your life just isnt going to be worth very much,45800,45847
114,And she and her family werent rich,46176,46210
115,They werent powerful,46558,46578
116,"So what could they do about it?"" ""That little girl reminded me of another little girl my mother",46908,47003
117,She didnt face the same challenges but she too was clocked from a full and happy childhood – abandoned by her own parents raised by grandparents who didnt want her and ended up on her own when she was just 14 supporting herself as a housemaid,47236,47478
118,But then something finally went her way,47738,47777
119,The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school,48131,48192
120,And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like,48531,48595
121,"After many lonely years it was the start of a better life."" ""The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone",48882,49021
122,We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up,49298,49359
123,And I remembered that sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair,49684,49751
124,"My colleagues and I at the Childrens Defense Fund along with others gathered the facts and we built a coalition of activists and families across America and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids."" ""So we opened the doors to school and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed 26 years ago",49914,50400
125,It was bipartisan,50572,50589
126,The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported,50970,51088
127,"And by the way Im proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this."" ""As Secretary of State I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world",51290,51672
128,And over the years Ive spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities,51886,51963
129,In addition to Anastasia who spoke at the convention another young man Ryan Moore also spoke there,52274,52372
130,I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old,52683,52723
131,I was fighting for health care reform,53062,53099
132,He was born with a rare form of dwarfism,53438,53478
133,But he never let that stop him,53796,53826
134,Hes had so many surgeries weve lost count of them,54137,54186
135,But his family was always there for them and – for him,54501,54555
136,And he was the advocate for himself as he got older,54874,54925
137,Now hes a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district,55262,55354
138,"And hes just one of the most optimistic people youll ever meet."" Listening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance never got the chance to get the education let alone go to college become forces for change",55589,55883
139,And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America,56037,56235
140,"""Ill never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said",56518,56583
141,Some of you may be too young to know who he was,56929,56976
142,He was a huge star,57337,57355
143,He played Superman,57743,57761
144,He was unbelievably good-looking,58142,58174
145,He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine,58532,58578
146,And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident,58920,58972
147,He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics family values,59302,59405
148,Since my accident he said Ive found a definition that seems to make sense,59697,59770
149,I think it means that were all family and we all have value,60070,60129
150,"I couldnt agree more."" ""Weve come a long way since the fall of 1973 when I was going door to door talking to kids and families",60396,60522
151,But make no mistake,60805,60824
152,We still have a lot more work to do,61174,61209
153,We cant be satisfied not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities arent in the workforce not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage cheers and applause not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day,61464,61791
154,"Weve got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities values their work treats them with respect."" ""Now one advocate after another has told me the same thing We dont want pity",62009,62208

159,Im going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits,64114,64279
160,People with disabilities shouldnt be isolated,64609,64654
161,They should be given the chance to work with everyone else,65039,65097
162,And were going to eliminate the subminimum wage which is a vestige from an ugly ignorant past,65440,65533
163,"Good work deserves fair pay no matter who you are."" ""Second were going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities",65835,66007
164,To have a truly inclusive economy we need a truly inclusive education system,66331,66407
165,So lets raise our standards,66803,66830
166,For too long accessibility has been an afterthought,67247,67298
167,Lets make it a priority in our curriculums our classrooms and the technology our students use,67677,67770
168,Its like what Anastasia said about her sister,68144,68189
169,She can communicate through a computer,68592,68630
170,"Then lets make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so."" ""Third were going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired",68943,69166
171,"As part of that well launch a new effort were calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace."" ""Fourth lets build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities",69331,69618
172,It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum and its a chance to show American values and American leadership,69861,69992
173,And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country,70265,70394
174,When I was secretary of state I went to 112 countries,70679,70732
175,And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities,71043,71164
176,Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away basically forgotten,71459,71573
177,"I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities."" ""Now these ideas are just a start",71805,72049
178,Were working with advocates to come up with even more,72305,72358

180,Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate,73088,73177
181,"This issue is very close to my heart."" ""Ive always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military",73449,73615
182,Its how we treat our fellow human beings especially the most vulnerable among us,73891,73971
183,And on this front especially I intend for my presidency to move our country forward,74311,74394
184,"Together we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream."" ""Now if you want some proof let me tell you this story",74660,74878
185,Its a story of a woman named Freia David,75137,75177
186,Now some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe,75493,75554
187,Ive carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much,75837,75913
188,Freia has Down syndrome,76226,76249
189,When she was 21 she got her first job at the local McDonalds,76588,76648
190,Her mother was a little worried as any mother would be,76974,77028
191,She wondered would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well not everyone in her class passed but Freia did,77320,77511
192,And then – then she excelled at that job for 32 years,77793,77846
193,Her colleagues loved her and she loved them,78184,78227
194,"The restaurant became such a home to her that shed bring her family there on off days just to hang out."" ""Earlier this year Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia",78508,78681
195,She knew that meant she had to stop working but 32 years is a pretty good run isnt it? It broke her heart,78918,79023
196,One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor,79291,79375
197,Her family hoped a few people might show up,79683,79726
198,And in the end nearly 100 people did: customers colleagues and friends from over the years,80053,80143
199,The party lasted three hours,80479,80507
200,And at one point one of Freias former managers asked for everyones attention,80862,80938
201,She turned to Freia and she said We love you,81284,81328
202,We appreciate you,81703,81720

206,We believe in equality and dignity for all,83272,83314
207,And when we fall short we strive to do better not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for,83619,83792
208,This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America to say loudly and clearly in this country no ones worthless no ones less than,84001,84218
209,Were all of value,84505,84522
