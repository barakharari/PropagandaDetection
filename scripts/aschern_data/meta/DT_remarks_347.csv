10,We went through an ugly chapter in our history during Vietnam when our troops became the victims of harassment and political agendas,4366,4498

22,We must maintain law and order at the highest level or  ,9661,9715
23,Hillary Clinton on the other hand is weak ineffective pandering and as proven by her recent email scandal which was an embarrassment not only to her but to the nation as a whole she is either a liar or grossly incompetent,9979,10200
24,Personally I think she is both,10466,10496
25,"""Not only am I the law and order candidate but I am also the candidate of compassion",10832,10916
26,But you cant have true compassion without providing safety for the citizens of the United States,11235,11331

36,"Hillary Clinton recently said of the VA scandal that ""its not been as widespread as it has been made out to be."" ""She actually thinks that the Veterans Health Administration is well run – thats because she has been part of the rigged system."" Perhaps it is easy for politicians to lose touch with reality when they are being paid millions of dollars to read speeches to Wall Street executives – instead of spending time with real people in real pain",15157,15606
37,The disconnect in America is deep,15787,15820
38,There are two Americas: the ruling class and the groups it favors and then everyone else,16196,16284
39,"""The VA scandals that have occurred on this Administrations watch are widespread and inexcusable."" An internal memo from a senior VA official describes ""lawlessness and chaos"" at the Veterans Health Administration including the payments of $6 billion a year in violation of federal contracting rules",16560,16859
40,"The memo also says they ""waste millions of dollars by paying excessive prices due to breaches of federal laws"" and warns that ""these unlawful acts may potentially result in serious harm or death to Americas Veterans."" Even the White Houses own Deputy Chief of Staff described ""significant and chronic systemic failures"" in Veterans Affairs including ""a corrosive culture that has led to personnel problems across the Department"" with ""poor management"" and ""a history of retaliation toward employees raising issues."" He said there is a ""lack of accountability across all grade levels."" Here are just a few examples: --Forty veterans died waiting for care in Phoenix",16860,17524
41,--Forty different VA facilities nationwide were found to be manipulating and falsifying wait times,17619,17717
42,--A VA employee who was involved in an armed robbery was kept on staff as was a convicted sex offender,18043,18145

53,A shocking 20 Veterans are committing suicide each day especially our older Veterans,22628,22712
54,This is a national tragedy,23101,23127
55,The evidence shows that if Veterans are in the system receiving care they are much less likely to take their own lives than Veterans outside the system,23469,23620
56,That is why we must increase the number of mental health care professionals inside the VA – while ensuring that Veterans can access private mental health care as well,23889,24055
57,America must take action to improve mental health services for the country at large,24383,24466

65,"Amazingly President Obamas VA Secretary recently downplayed concerns about waiting times by saying that people also wait in line at Disneyland."" I am going to use every lawful authority to remove and discipline federal employees or managers who fail our Veterans or breach the public trust",27867,28156
66,I am going to ask Congress to pass legislation that ensures the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has the authority to remove or discipline any employee who risks the health safety or well-being of any Veteran,28361,28566
67,I am going to appoint a commission to investigate all the wrongdoing at the VA and then present those findings to Congress as the basis for bold legislative reform,28820,28983
68,: I am going to make sure the honest and dedicated people in the VA have their jobs protected and are put in line for promotions,29235,29363
69,I will create a private White House Hotline – that is answered by a real person 24 hours a day – to ensure that no valid complaint about VA wrongdoing falls through the cracks,29584,29759
70,I will instruct my staff that if a valid complaint is not addressed that the issue be brought directly to me and I will pick up the phone and fix it myself if need be,29974,30140
71,"""Thats a promise."" We are going to stop giving bonuses to people for wasting money and start giving bonuses to people for improving service saving lives and cutting waste",30361,30531
72,If an employee finds a smart way to save a large amount of money that also creates better outcomes for our Veterans then a small responsible portion of the money saved will be given as a one-time bonus and the rest will be returned to taxpayers,30741,30985
73,We are going to reform our visa programs to ensure American Veterans are in the front not back of the line,31208,31314
74,: We are going to increase the number of mental health care professionals and increase outreach to Veterans outside of the system,31600,31729
75,: We are going to ensure every Veteran in America has the choice to seek care at the VA or to seek private medical care paid for by our government,31985,32131

79,Our country needs change and she will never give us change,33670,33728
80,The fact is she helped create our rigged system,34124,34171
81,"""Hillary Clintons America is a country where the elite get one standard of treatment and everybody else gets second-class treatment."" The rigged system refused to prosecute her for conduct that put all of America at risk",34480,34700
82,Hillary Clinton went to great lengths to create a private email server and to bypass government security in order to keep her emails from being read by the public and by federal officials,34947,35134
83,In other words she was willing to risk our foreign enemies reading her emails as long as the voting American public could not,35398,35523
84,Her conduct was willful intentional and unlawful – and her repeated false statements about her conduct prove that she was fully aware of her guilt,35820,35966
85,This was not just extreme carelessness with classified material – which is still totally disqualifying,36320,36422
86,This is calculated deliberate premeditated misconduct – followed by a cover-up that included false statements and lies to Congress the media and the American people,36764,36928
87,In fact when the FBI interviewed her for only 3 hours during the 4th of July weekend her interview was not recorded and she was amazingly not even put under oath,37203,37364
88,She carried out her dangerous email scheme at the same time as her bad judgement and enthusiasm for regime change was unleashing ISIS across the world,37619,37769
89,Afterwards as a further demonstration of guilt Hillary Clinton erased more than thirty thousand emails as part of the cover-up,38071,38197
90,The fact that she got away with all of this could be her single most impressive accomplishment,38541,38635
91,"""When thinking about her e-mail destruction lets not forget: many foreign and corporate entities and other special interests with business before Hillary Clintons State Department were making massive financial contributions",38965,39188
92,"These contributions were made to both the Clinton Foundation and to the Clintons directly."" ""If elected Hillary Clinton would become the first President of the United States who wouldnt be able to pass a background check."" Just look at what the FBI Director said about her – her misconduct is a disgrace and embarrassment to our country",39410,39746
93,Clearly Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law,39980,40031
94,Come November the American people will show her that she is not,40383,40446
95,The decades of decay division and decline will come to an end,40783,40844
96,The years of American Greatness will return,41193,41236
97,We are going to become for the first time in a long time one united country,41556,41631
98,We are going to make American Great Again – And Safe Again – For All Americans,41921,41999
99,We will dream big and bold and daring things once more,42311,42365
100,Let me conclude by paying tribute to every single American hero who has served this country and most especially those who gave the ultimate sacrifice,42675,42824
101,Our debt to them is eternal and everlasting,43151,43194
102,We are going to fight for our military and our law enforcement personnel the same way they have fought for us,43600,43709
103,We will be a safe strong and proud country once again,44119,44172
