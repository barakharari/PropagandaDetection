17,But to accomplish them we must replace the present policy of globalism – which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country – and replace it with a new policy of Americanism,7227,7416
18,Under this American System every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans?

36,It will be deficit neutral,15348,15374
37,If we reach 4% growth it will reduce the deficit,15783,15831
38,It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax regulatory energy and trade policies,16216,16315
39,Right now under Obama-Clinton policies the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter – that translates to millions of lost jobs,16651,16779
40,This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression,17135,17200
41,Over the last 7 years the economy grew only 2.1 percent the slowest period in seventy years,17553,17644

53,The 3 new brackets will be 12 25 and 33 but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all – in fact our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely,22411,22604
54,By lowering rates streamlining deductions and simplifying the process we will add millions of new jobs,22878,22980

67,One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate – down from the current 35% rate a reduction of more than 40 percent,28607,28758

80,Rule,34224,34228
81,It also means scrapping the EPAs so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year,34641,34768
82,This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most if not all coal-powered electricity plans in America,35123,35224
83,"Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners just like she wants to shut down the steel mills."" ""Were going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work."" Energy reform is central to our plan as well ""According to the Heritage Foundation by 2030 President Obamas energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars and reduce incomes by $7000 dollars per person."" Hillary Clinton wants to go even further and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars",35327,35895
84,A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production,36027,36117

86,In addition we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process,36879,37090
87,"Finally comes trade – the foundation for everything ""Americas annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year – an enormous drag on growth."" Between World War II and the year 2000 the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate",37303,37552

91,"The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization the job-killing trade deal with South Korea and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership."" ""The verdict is in",39163,39402
92,"All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal theyve promoted – every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality."" Our manufacturing base has crumbled communities have been hollowed out wages have declined and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000",39553,39912
93,I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America,40118,40224
94,"This includes the following steps: ""Im going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers",40511,40696
95,"I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators – and I know who you are many of you are in the room."" We are going to start with NAFTA which is causing so much damage to our country",40878,41159
96,We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed,41327,41479
97,We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership,41775,41845
98,Next I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States,42140,42341
99,"""I am going to instruct the U.S",42661,42692
100,Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China,43074,43129
101,"Chinas unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO and I intend to enforce those rules."" If China does not stop its illegal activities including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists",43395,43701
102,"""Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs",43975,44085
103,According to the U.S,44509,44529
104,"International Trade Commission improved protection of Americas intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year."" We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country and open a new highway of jobs back into our country",44816,45093
105,Here is how the plan adds up We are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model which is how taxes should be scored,45260,45427
106,This includes the childcare plan,45751,45783
107,Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost,46138,46315
108,That leaves around $800 billion dollars,46664,46703
109,This money can all be saved through simple common sense reforms,47108,47171
110,If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense and non-entitlement programs we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade – again this is spending that does not touch defense and that does not touch entitlements,47452,47692
111,If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit,47957,48065
112,Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs,48391,48527
113,This is the most pro-growth pro-jobs pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country,48851,48951
114,"This is what our new future will look like ""I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life; Im going to unleash American energy; Im going to repeal and replace Obamacare; Im going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; Im going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; Im going to save your 2nd amendment; Im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall Mexico will pay; and Im going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals especially NAFTA – and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first."" And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work",48925,49702
115,We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals,49680,49761

117,American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds,50599,50655
118,American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation,51012,51128
119,American workers will be hired to do the job,51485,51529
120,We will put new American metal into the spine of this country,51901,51962
121,Jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores,52340,52429
