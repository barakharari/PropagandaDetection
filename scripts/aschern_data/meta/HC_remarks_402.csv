75,If you are in a family that makes less than $125000 you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university,29147,29263

92,Hes kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list,35873,35927
93,He doesnt care whether NATO falls apart and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons,36267,36378
