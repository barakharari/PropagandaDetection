1,Thank you all for this really warm wonderful welcome,442,494
2,And I thank on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us,886,1007
3,Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election and I am very grateful for her support,1313,1414
4,"Im also delighted that were joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace."" I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House Michael Cox chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce Michael Ledbetter who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly",1624,1961
5,And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton   for his pledge of allegiance,2219,2290
6,And thanks to all the elected officials here,2650,2694
7,"And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week! ""Its almost hard to believe isnt it? There are only seven days left in this election."" So are you ready to vote? Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days? ""I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick whos been in Congress will be an independent voice for Florida families",2827,3269
8,"And I am so excited to think about what he could do because unlike his opponent hes never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump."" ""Now somebody asked me the other day Why do you keep coming back to Florida? Just look around folks",3326,3557
9,I mean it is a beautiful and I have lots of friends but its also really important in this election,3765,3863
10,Florida can decide who our next president is which will affect the nation and the world,4155,4242
11,And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about whats at stake in this election,4546,4673
12,"Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes."" ""One week from today we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States",4942,5131
13,I dont think the choice could be any clearer,5453,5497
14,I have spent my career fighting for children and families,5872,5929
15,I have served in the United States Senate served on the Senate Armed Services Committee,6285,6372
16,I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice,6714,6784
17,I represented you as your secretary of state going to 112 countries negotiating with friend and foe alike,7099,7204
18,"I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president."" Now I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent",7454,7603
19,And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons,7824,7972
20,"""When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons he said Well then why are we making them?"" ""And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president",8146,8499
21,And what he told the crowd — it was a big crowd at Kent State University — I think every voter should hear,8658,8764
22,Basically — his name was Bruce Blair — he said that having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack there is no appeal,8971,9236
23,There is no veto,9473,9489
24,And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say We need a president with the temperament the steadiness the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons,9761,9959
25,"And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities."" So when you think about voting early this week voting next Tuesday responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot",10173,10448
26,"""So is immigration",10760,10778
27,Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working raising their families as he has suggested he will do? I dont think so,11093,11226
28,I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they cant be exploited by employers like Donald Trump who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less,11438,11643
29,"I dont think thats right."" Now maybe for some of you what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war",11826,12067
30,We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform,12294,12403
31,"""Or maybe for some of you its what he said about a judge born in Indiana who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University",12644,12825
32,And so Trump said Well we cant trust him because his parents were born in Mexico,13081,13161
33,"Now Paul Ryan the Republican Speaker of the House called — well but wait a minute — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge The definition of a racist comment."" And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son Captain Khan died defending our country simply because that family was Muslim",13370,13695
34,"""And then lets not forget Trump spent years years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States even after the birth certificate was produced",13876,14036
35,Honestly if this were something new I think wed all be asking ourselves Well what does he have against President Obama? Or what does he have against me? But this is not new,14299,14471
36,"I know Im reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans."" ""And heres what I want you to tell",14705,14870
37,I want you to tell your Republican friends in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan,15092,15253
38,He said Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world,15523,15578
39,So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan better than President Obama – literally better than anybody I guess,15878,16013
40,And when you think about it what he said at the convention I alone can fix it runs counter to who we are as Americans,16268,16385
41,"We work together."" ""So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president",16630,16769
42,But today I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States,16923,17244
43,And during those debates Donald always used to say What have you been doing for 30 years? And I always found that kind of odd because he could Google it and find out,17405,17570
44,"And so Ive been a lawyer and Ive been a first lady and Ive been a senator and Ive been Secretary of State and Ive been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer and for my entire life Ive been a woman."" ""And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what hes been doing for 30 years he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning degrading insulting and assaulting women",17652,18060
45,And Ive got to tell you some of what weve learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting,18181,18269
46,I would frankly rather be here talking about nearly anything else like how were going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top,18533,18706
47,How were going to make college affordable for every single family because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125000 you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university,18920,19115
48,"And if youre above that it will be debt free and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it."" ""But I cant just talk about all of the good things we want to do because people are making up their minds",19255,19496
49,This is a consequential choice so weve got to talk about something that frankly is painful because it matters,19688,19797
50,We cant just wish it away,20112,20137
51,And a lot of his supporters dont like to hear this,20470,20520
52,I dont blame them,20856,20873
53,If I were supporting him I wouldnt want to hear it either to be honest,21198,21268
54,But Ive got to tell you I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: its not okay to insult people,21530,21658
55,"Its not okay."" ""And look at what he does",21943,21983
56,He calls women ugly disgusting nasty all the time,22313,22362
57,He calls women pigs rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10,22681,22737
58,We just heard from Alicia,23063,23088
59,She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant,23427,23484
60,Well he said she put on some weight and it made him angry so he called her Miss Piggy,23789,23874
61,He called her Miss Housekeeping because shes a beautiful Latina,24188,24251
62,He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise,24551,24633
63,Now he also said This is somebody who likes to eat,24936,24986
64,"Well I have to say: who doesnt like to eat? I mean really can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?"" ""But youve got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And Ill tell you who: a bully thats who",25188,25467
65,And thankfully Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down,25678,25747
66,"She knows that Donald Trump doesnt get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends."" ""But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence their sense of self-worth? If youve got a daughter a granddaughter a sister a mother a wife a good friend someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to."" ""Not so long ago I was the mother of a teenage girl",25830,26388
67,And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable and Im doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson,26422,26570
68,Because lets be honest here the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they dont look right theyre not thin enough they dont act right no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy or whatever the criticism might be,26743,27033
69,"Right?"" ""And I remember when Chelsea was a teenager I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall thats there for her to come home from school",27211,27376
70,And sometimes we only had a few minutes together,27645,27693
71,But before shed run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to I would figure out how was the day,27974,28090
72,Wed talk about what was on her mind,28375,28410
73,And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent because we parents and I know there are a lot of parents here today we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value and it really is important that we dont let anybody take that away from them,28591,28909
74,And we want them to be strong and we dont want them to feel bad about themselves,29082,29162
75,"And weve got to work hard to make sure our boys just like our girls have that same sense of positive energy: not negative not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women."" ""In fact all of us should respect each other in our country",29380,29628
76,So when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson I am on the same mission,29858,29933
77,I want them to know theyre love theyre cared for theyre respected,30234,30299
78,I want them to develop a good work ethic,30609,30649
79,I believe in hard work and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world,30950,31032
80,But thats what I want for every child,31332,31369
81,I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families,31671,31742
82,It will be the mission of my presidency,32056,32095
83,"I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?"" ""So I know theres work to be done",32339,32570
84,We cant do it with just words alone,32802,32837
85,Weve got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified,33156,33231
86,And oh my gosh when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women,33522,33595
87,Im not going to repeat it,33922,33947
88,But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women mistreating women,34284,34367
89,"And I have to tell you since that tape came out twelve women have come to say that What he said on that tape is what he did to me."" ""And then we heard his response",34615,34778
90,What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again insulting them,35007,35091
91,He said he couldnt possibly have said those things because the women werent attractive enough to assault,35389,35493
92,Look at her he said about one woman,35822,35857
93,I dont think so,36228,36243
94,"About another he said She wouldnt be my first choice."" ""Hes also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed",36515,36746
95,He said he did that — he said he did that to inspect them,36981,37038
96,That was his word – and he said I sort of get away with things like that,37332,37404
97,And sure enough contestants have come forward to say Yes thats exactly what he did to us,37662,37750
98,Now as bad as that is he didnt just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant,38018,38112
99,Hes also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant,38387,38449
100,Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing,38752,38833
101,"Some of them were just 15 years old."" ""We cannot hide from this",39144,39207
102,Weve got to be willing to face it,39532,39565
103,"This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady Michelle Obama spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trumps words have shaken her to her core."" ""For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives thats brought back painful memories",39781,40074
104,And for men who would never ever talk or act like Donald its been shocking to see this,40275,40361
105,He tried to explain it away as locker room talk well Ill tell you what a lot of professional athletes stood up and said Not in our locker rooms,40623,40766
106,"That does not happen."" Well I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man",41019,41123
107,"""And I dont think theres a woman anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like."" ""He doesnt look at us and see full human beings with our dreams and purposes our own capabilities",41373,41551
108,"And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign."" ""Well hes very wrong",41833,41913
109,He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country,42217,42277
110,He has shown us who he is,42599,42624
111,Let us on Tuesday show him who we are,42948,42985
112,We can stand up for what we believe what we want for our children and grandchildren what we know is right,43266,43371
113,And you can go down the list of everything he has said,43659,43713
114,He doesnt believe in equal pay he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience he wont raise the minimum wage and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table he gets angry,43974,44149
115,"Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families he wants to make it even harder."" ""Well I have a message for him",44386,44522
116,Were going to fight for affordable childcare,44837,44881
117,Were going to fight for equal pay for all people,45248,45296
118,Were going to fight for paid family leave were going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and thats important because so many people still struggling still working hard raising a family having a hard time getting all of their bills paid,45566,45827
119,And thats especially true for minimum wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women so weve got work to do my friends,46053,46174
120,Im excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you I will work for you I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be,46360,46541
121,"Because instead of Donald Trumps dangerous and divisive vision mine is positive optimistic hopeful and unifying."" ""But I cant do any of this without your help",46771,46929

130,"""Dont wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers."" ""Donald Trumps strategy is pretty simple– he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting people of color from voting that is a lot of people",50400,50648
131,"By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are."" ""Now I know here in this county and this larger region you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump",50796,51027

133,Ask them what they care about,51609,51638
134,Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy,51968,52024
135,Because Donald Trumps economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations,52335,52424
136,"I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250000 a year."" So there could not be no matter what you care about a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days",52614,52919

142,We are a big hearted generous people,55041,55077
143,Not a small minded people,55437,55462
144,We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people we push them down we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign,55745,55936
145,But sometimes the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance,56201,56271
146,For America this is one of those make or break elections,56586,56642
