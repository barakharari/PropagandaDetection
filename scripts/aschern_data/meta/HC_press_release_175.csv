0,"""The mothers of Trayvon Martin Eric Garner Sandra Bland Dontre Hamilton and Jordan Davis share what its like fight for justice alongside one another."" I have joined together with several other mothers who have lost children",0,223
1,We are the Mothers of the Movement,646,680
2,We have decided that we are going to band together and were going to tell the world our personal stories,1025,1129
3,This movement is about getting up and moving! Its about changing whats going on in our criminal justice system whats going on with policing in our communities,1418,1576
4,I know this is what I need to be doing because there are many people who are so angry with the state of whats going on in the world that theyre not going to vote,1808,1969
5,"So I can get out there and say ""Hey Im still standing",2207,2260
6,"Even in the midst of all this grief I can get up and move so you can too."" Thats why we say were Mothers of the Movement",2513,2633
7,We are moving,2921,2934
8,Were not parked we are going,3274,3302
9,Thats it,3642,3650
10,"""You know when youre a mom and youre grieving and youre missing your child even after youre done with the crying you still have to go home and deal with your regular life which is hard",3928,4112
11,And so when we get together it is one of the most powerful things you ever can imagine,4351,4437
12,We catch up and we hear whats going on with the legislature in each persons state,4709,4790
13,And we try to have fun,5099,5121
14,We try to at least laugh,5455,5479
15,Because there is a lot of crying sometimes,5807,5849
16,We keep tissue available,6175,6199
17,We will talk about our kids of course but we also talk about all the things that are going on in the world,6500,6606
18,And now with all of us endorsing Hillary were in this movement to get her in there,6876,6958
19,"We dont care what we have to do were going to do it."" Well first of all I wasnt even going to go to that meeting",7197,7309
20,It was one of those days where I woke up and it was a bad day,7533,7594
21,"I was having a ""Sandy day"" all day",7865,7899
22,"I was crying and I said ""Im not going ok?"" And then my daughter said ""What do you mean youre not going? Oh no were going."" So I get there and all the other moms are there and its like this big reunion",8114,8314
23,We just hugged each other,8561,8586
24,Might not have said a word but we just hugged each other and you could feel that energy,8901,8988
25,Then Hillary Clinton comes in she sits down,9310,9353
26,And immediately it was like shes at our kitchen table,9693,9746
27,There was this overwhelming sense that this is family,10084,10137
28,"She said ""Im honored to be here with you guys",10475,10520
29,"Tell me about your daughter your son."" And we were like ""My God."" She took her time and listened to each one of us around the table",10803,10934
30,"And then around the end of the meeting she said ""You guys really need to unify."" And thats what we did",11184,11286
31,"Then she said ""I will be getting back with you."" And to talk with all the ladies and find out thats literally what she did—you cant fake that",11537,11678
32,Thats not phony,11984,11999
33,Were just rolling with Hillary,12354,12384
34,Period,12740,12746
35,Well I guess you can call me an unwilling participant,13091,13144
36,I dont think any of the mothers that I come to the table with want to be on that side of the table,13432,13530
37,I would not have signed up for this I would not have trained for this,13798,13867
38,"This is something that happens in your life and you feel like ""I have to do something about it",14135,14229
39,I cant just continue to be broken,14516,14549
40,"I must do my part."" And so this is me doing my part not only for my son whos in heaven but for my son whos here on earth too",14801,14925
41,Ill always have two boys,15187,15211
42,But I will continue to do the work to try to fight against senseless gun violence,15502,15583
43,I will try to do what I can and Im dedicated to this fight,15863,15921
44,I cant help Trayvon at this time,16227,16259
45,But there are other Trayvon Martins who I can help,16579,16629
46,And working with these mothers is one way I can do that,16932,16987
47,It was a very heartfelt meeting,17324,17355
48,It was supposed to be pretty short in the beginning but because of the topics and the tragedies and the things that were being discussed Secretary Clinton wanted to hear more,17650,17824
49,The meeting was very productive on our end as mothers,18126,18179
50,But it was also an eye opener for Secretary Clinton because now not only did she hear about these tragedies in the news and on social media and from her staffers she heard first-hand from the mothers,18459,18658
51,And shes a mother,18937,18954
52,Shes a grandmother,19318,19336
53,Shes a wife,19708,19719
54,Shes a woman,20078,20090
55,She related to us at a time when nobody else would listen,20425,20482
56,"She made no promises about ""Ill do this and Ill do that if Im elected."" What she did commit to do was put every effort into making sure that this does not happen to anybody elses kid",20729,20911
57,She wanted to make sure that she put the proper laws and policies in place to try to make a difference,21137,21239
58,And that was important to us as mothers,21555,21594
59,"""We are having a crisis in the United States",21943,21987
60,Hillary Clinton has stepped out and is discussing this because she knows it is a huge problem in our community,22304,22414
61,She addressed the issue—and that meant a lot to us,22740,22790
62,Her experience and her leadership speaks for itself,23163,23214
63,Her information and how she deals with equality for women for minorities—it speaks for itself,23561,23654
64,I tell everybody to make sure theyre taking a look at the track record of some of these candidates and to make sure theyre not just talking the talk,23955,24103
65,That they have put the work in,24405,24435
66,"Hillary Clinton has put the work in."" Its camaraderie",24773,24826
67,Just a sense—I kind of hate to say it—but a sense of belonging,25153,25215
68,Because for us we are our own circle of mothers,25552,25599
69,Its very difficult to express what we feel and what we think to people who havent experienced what weve experienced,25909,26024
70,"People claim ""Oh I know how you feel."" No you dont know",26321,26376
71,And so to be able to lean on each other and to support each other and to nurture each other is so rewarding,26655,26762
72,And as we go forward it may seem like were very strong—but at the core were still pretty weak because you never get over this,27009,27134
73,I mean this is every day of our lives,27435,27472
74,And so to be in the company of other women—black women—who understand what Im bearing because theyre bearing the same thing its comforting,27795,27933
75,Its so comforting to be embraced by other women who really really share your pain,28240,28321
76,It was very powerful,28695,28715
77,There was just this sense of awe because Ive been watching the cases on television and Ive been watching the women and Ive been listening to their stories and listening to the news,29022,29202
78,But to actually be in the same company of women who have been so morally injured by the same gun violence the same implicit bias that was just ..,29440,29585
79,"I looked at Cleo Pendleton and I said to her ""You know what? Im so glad were together but its just so painful why we have to be at this meeting with Secretary Clinton",29800,29966
80,"We shouldnt have to be here for these reasons."" But it was empowering because during that meeting Secretary Clinton told us ""I need you the mothers to mobilize and move forward in this movement."" And before that nobody else had really given us permission to really begin to challenge those things that weve suffered",30141,30456
81,Wed just taken permission and decided ourselves to do it,30703,30759
82,But to have someone of the stature of Secretary Clinton back us up and support us and ask us to help champion as well and to know that shes championing for us and our communities that was huge,31027,31219
83,It was monumental to me,31506,31529
84,"""These are moments that are once-in-a-lifetime",31905,31951
85,Shes going to be the first female president of the United States and shes going to be able to help usher in change through everything that President Obama has already put in place,32264,32443
86,So to be a part of that history even this little small part that I get to play is such a tremendous blessing,32679,32787
87,So then it makes me know that Jordan and all of our children didnt die in vain,33048,33126
88,That were just all a bigger part of Gods greater plan,33414,33467
89,"And so to be able to be a part of that whether she wins or not Im grateful."" n ""Through Mothers for Justice I provide support to families who are victims of stolen life",33721,33889
90,I call them stolen lives—I dont call them victims because theyre not victims,34161,34237
91,The victims are those who are left in the wake of that stolen life and thats who I help,34550,34637
92,I get phone calls at three four in the morning from moms who just cant deal,34922,34997
93,And I know how they feel,35297,35321
94,I know their lives will never be the same,35639,35680
95,So we nurture we grieve together we depend on each other,36004,36060
96,And thats what we get our comfort from,36397,36435
97,"Our joy comes from God."" ""I enjoy being around my sisters",36767,36824
98,Its been educational,37171,37191
99,Its empowering and its been a spiritual journey,37552,37599
100,We laugh,37961,37969
101,We cry,38349,38355
102,We hold each other up in times of need,38719,38757
103,We depend on each other for answers,39115,39150
104,We are companions and were supportive of each others efforts,39506,39566
105,All of us have our connections with the Lord and what were doing in this movement and its phenomenal,39875,39975
106,And we keep our children right in the midst of everything we do,40279,40342
107,We say that our sons are seeds,40665,40695
108,I feel as though me and my family have been chosen to be a part of this movement because of our faith and Gods mercy and his grace,40964,41094
109,And a lot of the other victims of stolen lives feel the presence of those lives as well,41339,41426
110,"This is my lifes work—to get justice for my son and for those coming."" ""Because I believe Hillary Clinton will make the best president",41709,41843
111,I chose Hillary because of her record because of her caring spirit and because shes a listener and shes been involved since we got together,42124,42263
112,After we first met she made my struggle for justice her business and her affair,42563,42642
113,I had a meeting with Hillary at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,42979,43048
114,I spoke with her for about five minutes,43398,43437
115,She told me that she was a mother and a grandmother,43776,43827
116,She was very compassionate,44174,44200
117,She told me how sorry she was and that she was going to build her policy in a way that allowed her to do everything in her power to stop things like what happened to us from ever happening again,44459,44653
118,And right then and there during the meeting I knew that I was going to endorse her,44885,44967
119,I knew that some point in my near future I would be partnering up with her,45246,45320
120,I didnt know it would be to this extent but I am able to move forward because of her efforts,45586,45678
121,I appreciate that,45974,45991
122,"Thats why Im here."" ""My son no longer has a voice but his mother does",46306,46375
123,Im going to get out there and Im going to speak out,46679,46730
124,Im going to walk Im going to rally—whatever it takes—until my voice is heard until we get justice,47006,47103
125,As a people we have to take a stand,47391,47426
126,And I have to take a stand for my son as well as for the people who experienced this but no one knows their stories,47701,47816
127,Or they were in the news for one day and never talked about again,48070,48135
128,Im going to be the voice of the voiceless and the nameless,48444,48502
129,Im going to speak out—not only for Eric but for all the other mothers sisters brothers uncles and aunts out there,48795,48908
130,We have to make the world aware of what they are doing to our young men,49192,49263
131,"And if we dont stop it its going to continue."" There were 12 of us mothers in that meeting",49547,49637
132,Hillary asked each of us to share our stories and everyones child had died of gun violence—except for my child,49912,50022
133,"So when it became my turn she said before I even spoke ""Well I know Ms",50307,50377
134,"Carr your son didnt die from gun violence."" I said ""Youre right he was choked to death."" She said ""Theres something we have to do about that too."" She took that into consideration that no matter how your son died it was still violence",50597,50831
135,And this is what we need our officials to recognize—our hurt and our pain no matter how it came,51063,51158
136,It was really impressive to me because she was clearly concerned about my situation,51464,51547
137,"""The sermon was all about stepping outside of the box and for me that was a very powerful message",51871,51968
138,Because I sometimes say the same things to people about stepping outside the box,52286,52366
139,The box is repetitious,52714,52736
140,You do the same thing over and over and keep getting the same results which most of the time are not positive,53055,53164
141,When you step outside the box you dont know what youre going to get but youre taking a leap of faith,53423,53523
142,A lot of times when you go on faith you can get more things done more things will materialize,53798,53891
143,Sometimes you dont even know how they happen but they happen,54188,54248
144,And I step out the box a lot of times,54561,54598
145,This movement for my son—this is outside the box for me,54918,54973
146,I never thought that Id be doing this,55322,55359
147,I never thought Id be in South Carolina,55739,55778
148,I never thought Id be in Florida in California,56158,56204
149,"But Ive been all these places and thats outside the box for me."" ",56584,56648
