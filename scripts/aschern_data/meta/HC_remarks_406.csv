29,Now we dont yet know all the details about the shooting but we do know this family and this community is in pain,10758,10870
30,And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses,11154,11246
31,But we do more than pray,11564,11588
32,As Ms,11953,11958

34,"Not everyone can march but everyone can talk and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote."" Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves",12620,12832

37,And there have been many others,13983,14014
38,So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary everyday activities,14318,14534
39,Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles listening to music in their car with friends,14810,14909

41,Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others,15609,15695
42,From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well,15979,16124
43,"""Its been a hard year hasnt it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy another shattered family another distressed community",16387,16577
44,And our children are watching and they feel it too,16892,16942
45,Youve seen that right here in Charlotte,17331,17370

47,And when I read what she had said I had tears in my eyes too,18138,18198
48,She said We are black people and we shouldnt have to feel like this,18490,18557
49,Its a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed and we cant even see them anymore,18832,18917
50,Its a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them,19207,19270

56,They have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face,21685,21767
57,It makes my heart ache when kids like Zianna are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless,22083,22203
58,I know how I would feel,22523,22546
59,I wouldnt be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now,22860,22998
60,"But because my grandchildren are white because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state lets be honest here – they wont face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council."" ""You know every child deserves the same sense of security every child deserves the same hope",23188,23528
61,They should not be facing fear they should be learning and growing imagining who they can be and what their contributions to our country could be as well,23717,23870
62,Weve got to take action weve got to start now not tomorrow not next year now,24139,24215

70,He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge,27414,27464
71,A few days before he died he wrote on Facebook he was black but he wore blue,27767,27843
72,In uniform he wrote I get nasty hateful looks,28147,28192
73,Out of uniform some consider me a threat,28525,28565

79,"In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law."" That starts with being honest",30940,31051
80,Being unafraid to face the facts,31405,31437
81,Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped searched by police charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing,31735,31913
82,We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses,32177,32289
83,We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations,32629,32715
84,We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education,33066,33221
85,And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities,33554,33663

90,Who want to exploit peoples fears even though it means tearing our nation even further apart,35616,35708
91,They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more law and order,36024,36101
92,As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesnt exist,36436,36495
93,Now of course we need safe neighborhoods no one is against that,36833,36896
94,Of course we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence of course we need that,37212,37312
95,But we also need justice and dignity and equality and we can have both,37624,37694
96,"This is not an either-or question for America."" ""I want us to commit ourselves to this common vision",37998,38098

108,To fight for each others children each others dignity each others opportunity as if they were our own,42591,42692
