8,""" Back in 2001 when we had 9/11 and you were a senator from New York there was a different spirit in this country including the Republican Party",3107,3251
9,You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East,3490,3624
10,Its not about Muslims,3938,3959
11,Its about terrorism,4360,4379
12,"And he did it so effectively."" ""And now we have the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president basically declaring a war on Muslims saying theyre not allowed in the country the whole works",4696,4903
13,"What do you make of this?"" "" Well its deeply distressing to me because I as you know well remember what happened after 9/11",5163,5286
14,"And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that."" ""And now we need to have a sense of unity and purpose in combatting terrorism",5516,5727
15,I view it as a threat,5983,6004
16,I believe ISIS cannot be contained,6349,6383
17,It has to be defeated,6735,6756
18,But in order to do that we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans so that what Im hearing from the other side is not only offensive and shameful its dangerous counterproductive,7056,7251
19,"And of course we have to work with countries around the world in order to have a unified coalition against terrorism."" ""And Ive laid out very clearly what I think needs to be done and it does include an American-led air alliance and were doing that",7454,7702
20,"And were supporting troops on the ground that are not Americans special forces but we do need to have the Kurds and the Arabs with special forces support but not American combat troops."" And we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan Afghanistan and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet",7797,8206
21,"""But then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home",8405,8481
22,We have to work with our friends and allies around the world,8782,8842
23,And I know you just got back from Israel,9141,9181
24,We have a lot of important work to do with countries from one end of the globe to the other,9462,9553
25,And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere,9835,9910
26,"And thats what Im advocating."" "" Thats why Im concerned about the Republican Party because this ethnic way of going at this situation the way they seem to be going at the Muslim people rather than the terrorists—this started—remember when the man whose name we dare not speak anymore Donald Trump—I mean the fact is Trump started his sort of initiation in politics by saying the president of the United States was an illegal immigrant he was probably a Muslim he had a—he almost was an identity thief who created a notion of himself through a phony birth certificate a phony birth announcement and he was somehow—in fact he used to say things—Trump would say things like Nobody knew him in school like hes some phantom impersonator usurper."" The Republican Party every time he did that said nothing",9904,10702
27, Right,10733,10738
28,""" Boehner the speaker of the House who was pretty much respected wouldnt—isnt this a Republican Party problem that started with Trumps first arrival on the world stage as some sort of politician that its ethnic with them?

29,"Its pretty sick."" "" Well its very divisive and I think counterproductive",11550,11622
30,It undermines our values who we are as a people,11965,12012
31,We are a nation of immigrants which you know so well,12363,12415
32,And when I hear whats coming from the other side—and its not just one person,12736,12812
33,Theres an echo chamber there,13153,13181
34,"And its very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer divide and conquer and you know a house divided against itself cannot stand."" ""We need to be united",13479,13636
35,And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric who use the kind of derogatory comments whether its about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities whoever it might be,13887,14083
36,That is not a sign of leadership,14405,14437
37,"Thats a sign of you know showmanship of desperation that should be rejected roundly by the American people.""  By the way you know my grandmother spoke Irish when I grew up",14738,14908

238, You said Go for it,90970,90988
239, I did,91350,91355
240,I did you know after as I say sitting through hours of meetings listening to the intelligence being presented listening to Admiral McRaven who was then the head of special forces talk about you know what special forces could do looking at other options..,91625,91879
241, Yes,92201,92204
242, ..,92638,92640
243,like a cruise missile or a Predator—armed predator and recommending to the president that we go with the Navy SEAL option and then being there that day watching part of the operation on a video screen in the Situation Room just holding my breath literally through the whole thing,92917,93196
244,I know how hard these choices are,93441,93474
245,And I know what a cool deliberative head needs to be finally making them,93811,93883
246, Yes,94238,94241

250, Yes,95835,95838
251,Yes,96229,96232
252, Let me ask about your sort of position on this,96600,96646
253,You voted for the Iraq War authorization if not the war,96984,97039
254,"""Bernie Sanders is out there still hitting you on that one",97373,97431
255,Of course hes coming from the left on you,97737,97778
256,"You have got Rand Paul out there who is a libertarian and a bit of a—I would say a bit of a dove saying that you would be more for regime change that you would start the next war."" "" Yes",98011,98197
257,Well hes wrong,98450,98464
258,"He is wrong."" "" Theyre positioning you as to the hawkish side of Obama.""  Yes",98800,98876
259,Right,99231,99236
260," How—where would you—you read Fred Hiatt of ""The Washington Post"" the other day..",99591,99671
261, Yes,100024,100027
262, ..,100420,100422
263,position you as someone I thought a notch to the hawkish side because he said you were for a no-fly zone in Syria,100768,100881
264,You were for ground troops but not necessarily our troops but some..,101187,101255
265, Right,101613,101618
266, Because you need a ground component to tell the bombs where to—to tell them where to drop the bombs,101964,102063
267, Right,102414,102419
268,Exactly,102819,102826
269,Right,103222,103227
270, Does that make you more hawkish than the president?  Well I think most of what I have been advocating the president is now doing,103556,103683
271, But not that,103997,104009
272, Well we have special forces on the ground,104374,104415
273,He sent them,104780,104792
274, But no-fly zone?  But the no-fly zone for me was an idea that I developed with some advisers,105121,105212
275, Is it dangerous with the Russians flying around there?  Well of course you would have to have the Russians to sign off on it,105479,105602
276, Yes,105921,105924
277, And we were making progress,106287,106314
278,"""I dont know what the result will be of the conflict now between Saudi Arabia and Iran",106635,106721
279,"But you know for the last four years we have been pushing to try to get a peace conference going."" ""And I give Secretary Kerry credit for getting everybody agreeing to be in the same room",106981,107168
280,I saw the no-fly zone as leverage,107443,107476
281,Number one if we could get the Russians on board because we would have to—and I think we could if we were to say look we need safe zones,107757,107893
282,"If were going to be operating on the ground advising the Kurds the Arabs we need safe zones."" ""We also need safe places for civilians so that theyre not refugees leaving Iraq and Syria",108108,108292

292, Army,112187,112191
293,They have to turn it over to Sunnis,112541,112576
294, And then turn it over,112926,112947
295, Yes,113315,113318
296, This makes all the sense in the world to me,113665,113708
297,"""So I view myself as being a realist being practical and in accordance with our values because I think its very important that we get back to promoting our values and pursuing our interests and protecting our security."" ""If the United States doesnt do that on our own behalf or on behalf of our friends in Europe and Asia and the Middle East no one will",113901,114254
