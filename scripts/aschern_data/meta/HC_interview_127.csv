0, Madam Secretary thank you so much for this time,0,47
1, My pleasure to see you again,429,457
2,""" So were very close to voting in New Hampshire.""  We are",839,895
3,""" The polls show Senator Sanders still significantly ahead",1277,1335
4,"If you do not win in New Hampshire does that imply that theres going to be — or in your mind does that mean you need to change course at all? Will that mean your campaign going ahead will be different than leading into this?"" "" You know Rachel Ive always had a different view on this than I think maybe some others have",1566,1885
5,I always knew Iowa was going to be really really hard,2082,2135
6,"And we won narrow but a win is a win.""  One quarter of one percent",2438,2503
7,""" Yes Im always happy about that",2813,2845
8,I always knew that Senator Sanders been in public life next door for 25 years hes on the Congress for that long he had a tremendous amount of familiarity and a sense of really belonging in the area,3103,3300
9,So I always knew this was going to be hard,3547,3589
10,I feel good about the campaign we waged here,3911,3955
11,I think we have an uphill battle,4301,4333
12,"Were going to battle it until the last votes are counted and were going to turn around and head off for the next contest.""  Politico.com just this afternoon just published something that says that theres changes in the works",4616,4839
13,Theres always these sort of campaign gossip stories,5130,5181
14,But they are say — they say theyre citing a half dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation,5554,5654
15,"Their lead is ""Hillary and Bill Clinton are so dissatisfied with their campaigns messaging and digital operations theyre considering staffing and strategy changes after whats expected to be a loss in Tuesdays primary."" Are you planning some sort of shake up like that? "" Yes somebody showed that to me",5918,6219
16,I have no idea what they are talking about or who they are talking to,6435,6504
17,Were going to take stock,6832,6856
18,But its going to be the campaign Ive got,7186,7226
19,Im confident in the people I have,7563,7596
20,Im very committed to them,7950,7975
21,Theyre committed to doing the best we can,8332,8373
22,Were going to take stock,8735,8759
23,What works what doesnt work? Were moving into a different phase of the campaign,9108,9187
24,Were moving into different geographic areas,9522,9565
25,"So of course it would be malpractice not to say OK what worked? What can we do better? What can we do new and different that we have to pull out?"" "" President Clinton was here with you today as was your daughter",9834,10045
26,President Clinton did his own event yesterday which made some headlines when he had some very harsh criticism for Senator Sanders campaign essentially calling Senator Sanders and his campaign hypocritical dishonest calling out sexism from Senator Sanders supporters,10232,10497
27,Although Senator Sanders have called out his on supporters for sexism and said he will not tolerate it,10805,10907
28,"Is President Clinton going further than you would in those criticisms for the Sanders campaign or do you also share the view that hes been dishonest and hypocritical?"" "" Well heres my view and I think Bill was really defending my supporters because we know a lot of them are being harassed online theyre being harassed at our events",11116,11448
29,They are being really treated badly,11687,11722
30,Look Im all for people who are for my opponent,12074,12120
31,I think its great to bring in as many new young people as possible,12442,12508
32,I want people treated respectfully,12848,12882
33,I think thats part of what he was talking about,13235,13282
34,I have been concerned about tone of his campaign over the last weeks,13608,13676
35,We were running I thought a good campaign on issues,14014,14065
36,Were getting to the point we have to draw contrasts,14394,14445
37,Thats natural,14792,14805
38,You know I have a health care approach,15154,15192
39,He has a health care approach,15522,15551
40,We may have the same goal but we have a different view about how we get there,15868,15945
41,That is fair game as it should be,16244,16277
42,But there has been a constant undercurrent that I said in the debate last week was a kind of attack by innuendo insinuation kind of artful smears,16559,16704
43,And I just said enough is enough,16986,17018
44,You know if you have something to say to my face say it,17343,17398
45,If you can point to any event any vote any view that you think has been influenced by any donation Ive ever made call it out you know? Then they put up the bankruptcy bill,17637,17808
46,I answered that yesterday on the morning shows,18076,18122
47,And so I want this innuendo to stop,18475,18510
48,You know lets just be honest with each other,18868,18912
49,Look Senator Sanders has taken money from Wall Street,19276,19329
50,He took it through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee,19701,19760
51,Thats what we do,20131,20147
52,That doesnt mean his views are compromised,20524,20566
53,It doesnt mean my views and it doesnt mean that President Obamas views when he was running for the presidency — he took a lot of money from Wall Street — in any way stopped him from pushing through and signing Dodd Frank and imposing tough rules,20818,21063
54,So its a — you know he gets his supporters — he sends some messages and his campaign then amplifies those messages,21257,21371
55,And then a lot of his young people get really worked up and theyre going off on tangents,21648,21736
56,They can attack me thats fine,22066,22095
57,Im in the arena,22462,22477
58,But to go after journalists who say something nice about me to go after supporters who post things to go after elected officials who are for me because you know I have the vast majority of elected officials on the Democratic side because they know us both,22732,22987
59,"And they know I would be the president who can actually get done what Im saying."" "" As a journalist and who is an out and proud liberal I get attacked 50/50 by people who say Im a dyed in the wool partisan for Bernie and then the other 50 said it said Im dyed in the wool partisan for you",23100,23388
60,And people really have decided one way or the other about 50/50 that Im completely in the tank,23557,23651
61,I do not notice a difference in the tone or the nastiness or the snark or the inappropriateness of those attacks that I get from the people who support you or Senator Sanders,23908,24082
62,"If you did want to change the tone of things from your supporters could you? I mean he said he doesnt want sexism and other forms of offensive comments from his supporters can he do more than he is? Could you do more than you do?"" "" I think we should do what we can",24240,24505
63,But Im also focused on what he says,24710,24745
64,You know his argument basically is this,25084,25123
65,Anyone who has taken a donation from anyone connected with Wall Street is compromised,25439,25524
66,Theyre vote has been bought,25867,25894
67,They cant be trusted,26277,26297
68,That is just not true,26685,26706
69,"If it is true now it includes him we know because hes taken contributions from Wall Street."" "" He said yesterday that no politician theres never been a politician in history who says yes the money that I took influences me",26991,27213
70,"So therefore essentially implying like the defense that there isnt that you dont claim to be been influenced is by the donations is no defense."" "" But lets put out the proof Rachel",27432,27612
71,Dont listen to what people say,27903,27933
72,I find it deeply offensive,28293,28319
73,You know I have worked really hard,28673,28707
74,Ive taken on many more powerful groups than he has,29053,29103
75,Ive taken on the drug companies the insurance companies,29442,29497
76,Ive got big oil going after me,29856,29886
77,Ive got hedge fund guys spending $6 millions of dollars in ads against me which I would think would raise an interesting question if they are so worried about Bernie why are they trying to defeat me? Ive taken onto gun lobby something that you know he never has done,30143,30409
78,So Ive got the scars to prove my bona fides and what Im willing to take on and how Ive stood firm against an onslaught of attacks you know turning me into the political pinata sometimes,30560,30745
79,So point to the evidence,31033,31057
80,Otherwise stop it,31436,31453
81,Lets talk about I want to get to universal coverage building on the Affordable Care Act,31800,31887
82,You want to start over with single payer,32214,32254
83,Let the people decide whats the best way to do this,32580,32631
84,"So thats what this should be about."" "" On the — staying for a moment on that that line of attack",32936,33032
85,You had mentioned in the debate when Chuck asked you about transcripts of speeches that you gave paid speeches that you would look into it,33293,33431
86,Weve had some further word from your campaign that there may be a release of those transcripts,33726,33820
87,"Whats the status of that? Do you expect to release those speeches?"" "" Well you know what I said the other day — you know look Im getting a little bit weary of the double standard",34063,34241
88,Theres a lot of people on both sides,34495,34531
89,If were going to start saying what you did when youre out of public office when youre in the private sector what you did fair game,34812,34942
90,Release it all,35265,35279
91,"Im all for that.""  You mean all presidential candidates? "" Yes everybody release everything",35636,35726
92,But again Ive been asking to do something for which theres no basis just the attempt to cast suspicion,36035,36137
93,So I said I will look into it,36453,36482
94,We will look into it,36837,36857
95,But you know whats good for the gander should be good for the goose,37166,37233
96,"""  "" So you wouldnt do it unilaterally but if everybodys going to do it you would do it?"" "" Well this is — Im really not thinking about it until I get through New Hampshire to be honest",37458,37642
97,"I want to get through tomorrow and then you know its going to be very boring for people once it is done under whatever circumstances.""  Did you see the Republican debate on Saturday night?  I was at my own event in Portsmouth",37812,38035
98,So I — I did not see,38288,38308
99, Have you been able to resist the temptation to watch the clips of Marco Rubio saying the same thing over and over and over again?  I did get to see that because I was on every news channel that I was flipping around,38539,38753
100,""" Do you have — I mean hes seen as at least coming out of Iowa as having a lot of momentum as a potential nominee for the Republican Party",38923,39061
101,"Do you have any reaction or opinion about that performance from him?"" "" Im going to leave my opinions to myself because I dont want to in any way influence their process because they have to make their decision and clearly the longer it lasts and the more difficult it is the better it will be for us."" "" I went to some Republican candidate events since Ive been up here and —""  They let you in? "" They let me in",39166,39577
102,I wear a baseball hat,39724,39745
103,Incognito situation,40111,40130
104,But I specifically wanted to talk to women voters who were there at Republican candidate events,40476,40571
105,And I found a number of different women to talk to,40884,40934
106,Some are dyed this wool Republicans but more often I found are women open to the idea of voting for a Democrat,41234,41344
107,I talked to a few women who voted for Barack Obama either last time or in 2008,41626,41704
108,But they are shopping for a Republican candidate this year,42023,42081
109,And 2-1 the reason they said they are shopping for a Republican candidate and not thinking about voting here in the Democratic side is because they do not believe that you are honest,42372,42554
110,They have issue with your trustworthiness,42854,42895
111,I know you see this come up in the polls and people talk about their feelings about the various candidates,43242,43348
112,Im sure you disagree with that assessment from them,43674,43725
113,I understand that,44099,44116
114,But how do you make the case to people to women in particular for whom thats the objection,44459,44549
115,"Thats why they cant pull the lever for you."" "" You know obviously this is not anything I want to hear because I find it so absolutely contrary to who I am and who all these people who support me who know me work with me and count on me know who I am",44752,45001
116,But I thought a lot about it Rachel because when you think back I emerged on the national scene in 1992,45167,45270
117,I have been under relentless attack ever since,45581,45627
118,Now just read behavioral science read psychology even when the attacks proved to be unfounded untrue it leaves a residue right? People say well why is she being attacked so much? It must be something there,45917,46122
119,So I get through the 90s,46406,46430
120,I run for the Senate,46771,46791
121,Same thing happen,47138,47155
122,I worked I gained the trust of the people of New York,47476,47529
123,When I run again I get a larger percentage of the vote,47815,47869
124,So people who see me in action people who count on me people who know that if I tell you something intend to do I will do everything in my power to make that happen,48106,48270
125,Then President-elect Obama turns around after that hard fought campaign with all sorts of accusations flying around say I trust you I want you to be my secretary of state,48503,48673
126,When Im holding office I get along well with Republicans,48974,49030
127,I will always have the you know right wingers who are never going to give up on trying to push me down and push me out,49294,49412
128,They view me as a threat,49688,49712
129,And I accept that,50033,50050
130,But when I get to work with people we get things done,50347,50400
131,And thats been my pattern,50698,50723
132,So when I get that question and I ask people I say what is it you are really reacting to? Very often they dont know,50997,51112
133,Then a lot of them will say well Benghazi,51403,51444
134,I said OK Benghazi,51803,51821
135,You know did you know there were nine separate investigations eight of them independent one of them clearly partisan admittedly to try to bring me down politically,52150,52313
136,And they all reach the same conclusions,52645,52684
137,There were things we could have and should have done better,53057,53116
138,I immediately said we would,53483,53510
139,I testified for 11 hours,53881,53905
140,I answered every question but its still on the TV,54250,54299
141,I hear people talking about it,54630,54660
142,I cant stop them from talking about it,54992,55030
143,I can only tell you what the facts are,55358,55396
144,I can tell you that in the last what 36 37 years weve had terrorist problems in Iran in Lebanon in Kenya in Tanzania in New York and yes in Benghazi — none of them were every politicized,55634,55820
145,We lost 258 marines and embassy personnel in Beirut,56086,56137
146,The Democrats didnt stand up and go after the secretary of state,56501,56565
147,We lost people in Kenya and Tanzania 12 Americans hundreds of Africans,56923,56993
148,Madeleine Albright was secretary of state she forthrightly asked for a report,57347,57424
149,She made it public,57795,57813
150,People didnt turn it into a partisan attack,58194,58237
151,So I have to only conclude that there is a concerted effort to try to make partisan advantage by really throwing some much at me that even if little splotches of it stick it will cloud peoples judgment of me,58504,58711
152,So thats a burden I carry,58971,58996
153,But when you stop and think you know the people who have supported me are not doing it because they just like me,59296,59408
154,I have the governor of Vermont supporting me,59724,59768
155,I have Pat Leahy the senator from Vermont supporting me the two former governors Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean supporting me,60098,60224
156,They clearly know us both,60567,60592
157,They clearly prefer to support me,60974,61007
158,I have the senator here the governor in New Hampshire,61373,61426
159,They know me,61806,61818
160,They trust me,62215,62228
161,Theyre not the kind of people who would just sign onto campaign for some frivolous reason,62585,62674
162,I have all my friends from the Senate Cory Booker and Tim Kaine and Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow and Amy Klobuchar they were all up here in the snow because they believe in me and they trust me,62928,63131
163,So I cant stop the barrage of attacks,63396,63433
164,I want your viewers and anyone else who would be interested in this to ask themselves why does the right and particularly the Republicans spend so much time money and effort through the media through their advertising because you look at the Republicans are running more ads against me than they run against each other accusing me of being this and that all kinds of accusations,63643,64021
165,Why? Ill tell you why because they are afraid of me,64227,64278
166,They know that I will be a president who yes I will listen to people I will seek common ground but I will stand my ground and I know how to get things done,64523,64678
167,"And thats the last thing these guys want to see again."" "" What did you learn by going there that you didnt need before?"" "" Nothing substitutes for sitting like I did and you were there when you were there with mothers who told me about what had happened to their families",64826,65097
168,A mother who moved to Flint just serendipitously right up at the time the crisis was beginning a year ago April pregnant with twins started seeing rashes lost her twins,65271,65439
169,Just sitting there like Im sitting with you just hearing that story you know there is a depth of emotion and horror frankly associated with not being able to trust the water you drink and that you bathe your baby in,65655,65870
170,And listening to a lot of officials explained in detail how little control they had because their city was under emergency management under the governor getting into the real detail about what they could and couldnt do and how they literally couldnt get phone calls returned letters answered talking to some of the water warriors who have been on this issue and doing everything they could to bring it to public attention talking to the doctors who are leading up the efforts to test kid and what more they need,65923,66434
171,It really filled out in great excruciating detail how terribly damaged and abused this community has been and it reminded me that people have a right to be angry,66518,66679
172,I have no argument with the anger the insecurity the fear the worry that people have when your government fails you when the economy fails you when politics fails you anger is a natural and frankly expected result,66896,67109
173,But as we were talking yesterday and as this incredible mayor who has just taken this city on her back and is trying to lift it up said OK we are so distraught our hearts are broken,67312,67493
174,Our stomachs are sick with worry about what happens next but we need a plan,67728,67803
175,"So I came to try to get them more support working with all levels of government to try to make sure they had whatever they needed to do as much as possible to empower themselves and I got a long list of you know follow up I will be doing over the next weeks.""  You said yesterday you were making a personal commitment you would see it through —  Yes",67955,68302
176,""" — to the end",68477,68491
177,I will say just my opinion being there my felling when I was there was that I couldnt believe the basic things that families needed to cope on a day-to-day basis were not attended to,68774,68956
178,What I aim at specifically there is no day-to-day delivery of clean water in Flint,69225,69307
179,"So theres a lot love people average poor American city people dont have transportation or people could be house bound elderly people right now still to this day today the day before the New Hampshire primary the plan is for people to go out to the fire stations and collect their allotted one case of bottled water per day — is there a sense in which the emergency not just fixing it for the long haul but the emergency of what people need day-to-day still isnt being attended to and there ought to be some quicker response right now?"" "" Yes",69407,69948
180,Yes,70084,70087
181,Look as I said yesterday weve got a very big infrastructure problem that has to be fixed,70440,70528
182,Congress is working on that my friend Debbie Stabenow is really leading the charge,70838,70920
183,We have a huge set of problems having to do with the needs that people have that are not being met,71224,71322
184,You mentioned one of them clean water,71627,71664
185,"We still dont have all the testing set up to be done.""  Right",71980,72040
186,""" We dont have the planning yet for what has to happen in the schools",72339,72408
187,We dont know whether we can get not just clean water but the kind of nutrition that can maybe begin to mitigate to some extent the affects of blood before it gets from the bloodstream into tissues muscles et cetera,72647,72861
188,So we have a long list and I brought some folks with me who are going to stay involved and help with that planning process and we have a big lack of trust and one of the things that I have advocated is we need to find a way not just to empower but to hire people in the community to be the outreach workers to do the water delivery to be on the front lines in their neighborhoods,72929,73308
189,So were putting together under the mayors leadership a kind of matrix of tasks and who can do them what they need to be able to do them,73413,73548
190,A lot of them dont need training,73834,73866
191,Some of them might,74222,74240
192,"And so how do we piece all this together and talking with the city council county commissioners and others theres roles for everybody to play but somebody has to have the overall approach that is followed.""  And quick",74590,74806
193, Yes and very quick,75196,75214
