0,Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation,0,132
1,It truly is a great honor,550,575
2,I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country one that replaces randomness with purpose ideology with strategy and chaos with peace,951,1127
3,It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy,1435,1491
4,It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold something we have to do,1843,1927
5,The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle,2259,2337
6,My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else,2651,2758
7,Has to be first has to be,3096,3121
8,That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make,3480,3549
9,America – thank you,3908,3927
10, Applause  America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration,4269,4351
11,But to chart our path forward we must first briefly take a look back,4668,4736
12,We have a lot to be proud of,5074,5102
13,In the 1940s we saved the world,5468,5499
14,The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists,5853,5922
15,Then we saved the world again,6282,6311
16,This time from totalitarianism and communism,6680,6724
17,The Cold War it lasted for decades but guess what we won and we won big,7092,7163
18,Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr,7532,7581
19,Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan our great president when he said “Tear down this wall.”  Applause History will not forget what he did,7922,8070
20,Very special special man and president,8416,8454
21,Unfortunately after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course,8810,8885
22,We failed to develop a new vision for a new time,9227,9275
23,In fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense,9622,9698
24,Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another,10007,10111
25,They just kept coming and coming,10453,10485
26,We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria,10826,10920
27,Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper,11197,11314
28,Very bad,11645,11653
29,It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy,11981,12138
30,We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed,12460,12542
31,Civil war religious fanaticism thousands of Americans and just killed lives lives lives wasted,12909,13003
32,Horribly wasted,13384,13399
33,Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result,13808,13855
34,The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill,14233,14276
35,Iran too would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment,14637,14717
36,They have benefited so much so sadly for us,15056,15099
37,Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster,15466,15517
38,No vision,15913,15922
39,No purpose,16337,16347
40,No direction,16764,16776
41,No strategy,17197,17208
42,Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy,17614,17681
43,First our resources are totally over extended,18067,18112
44,President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy,18519,18585
45,He’s crippled us with wasteful spending massive debt low growth a huge trade deficit and open borders,18960,19061
46,Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year,19434,19518
47,We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own,19895,19951
48,Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength,20296,20455
49,I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem,20746,20844
50,I’m the only one — believe me I know them all I’m the only one that knows how to fix it,21137,21224
51, Applause Secondly our allies are not paying their fair share and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot,21517,21625
52,Our allies must contribute toward their financial political and human costs have to do it of our tremendous security burden,21931,22054
53,But many of them are simply not doing so,22394,22434
54,They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us,22772,22881
55,In NATO for instance only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense,23165,23299
56,We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes missiles ships equipment building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia,23583,23735
57,The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense and if not the U.S,24018,24105
58,must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves,24437,24494
59,We have no choice,24865,24882
60, Applause The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security,25220,25329
61,A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded and funded beautifully,25660,25762
62,Thirdly our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us,26108,26174
63,We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country,26497,26636
64,He negotiated disastrous deal with Iran and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry,26919,27028
65,Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon cannot be allowed,27348,27413
66,Remember that cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon,27773,27829
67, Applause And under a Trump administration will never ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon,28188,28284
68, Applause All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day,28586,28750
69,In negotiation you must be willing to walk,29059,29101
70,The Iran deal like so many of our worst agreements is the result of not being willing to leave the table,29416,29520
71,When the other side knows you’re not going to walk it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win,29796,29907
72,At the same time your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them,30194,30298
73,You’ve made that agreement you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place,30586,30673
74,President Obama gutted our missile defense program then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic,30990,31116
75,He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place,31419,31588
76,Israel our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity,31860,32007
77,Just a few days ago Vice President Biden again criticized Israel a force for justice and peace for acting as an impatient peace area in the region,32285,32431
78,President Obama has not been a friend to Israel,32742,32789
79,He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power,33122,33193
80,Iran has indeed become a great great power in just a very short period of time because of what we’ve done,33476,33581
81,All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel our allies in the region and very importantly the United States itself,33862,33984
82, Applause We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help,34296,34400
83,Remember that,34763,34776
84,Not good,35181,35189
85,Fourth our rivals no longer respect us,35587,35625
86,In fact they’re just as confused as our allies but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore,35961,36077
87,The truth is they don’t respect us,36398,36432
88,When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One no leader was there nobody to greet him,36771,36863
89,Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One,37193,37283
90,Then amazingly the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia,37648,37702
91,It’s called no respect,38101,38123
92,Absolutely no respect,38541,38562
93,Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen Denmark to get the Olympics for our country and after this unprecedented effort it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place,38829,39151
94,He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment,39387,39464
95,We were laughed at all over the world as we have been many many times,39808,39877
96,The list of humiliations go on and on and on,40229,40273
97,President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach,40628,40757
98,Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea,41069,41254
99,We have the leverage,41589,41609
100,We have the power over China economic power and people don’t understand it,41962,42036
101,And with that economic power we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea which is totally out of control,42299,42438
102,He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies,42689,42841
103,We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything and they do,43155,43241
104,They do at will,43609,43624
105,It always happens,44032,44049
106,If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America he could not have done a better job,44402,44490
107,Finally America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals,44808,44887
108,Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy,45199,45303
109,One day we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians,45620,45711
110,The next day we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart,46053,46158
111,Lives lost massive moneys lost,46554,46584
112,The world is a different place,47006,47036
113,We’re a humanitarian nation but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness confusion and disarray a mess,47419,47543
114,We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before,47908,47977
115,We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide,48363,48430
116, Applause We have done nothing to help the Christians nothing and we should always be ashamed for that for that lack of action,48763,48888
117,Our actions in Iraq Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS and we’re in a war against radical Islam but President Obama won’t even name the enemy and unless you name the enemy you will never ever solve the problem,49124,49339
118, Applause Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country,49574,49720
119,After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans,50051,50212
120,Then instead of taking charge that night Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep,50565,50650
121,Incredible,51053,51063
122,Clinton blames it all on a video an excuse that was a total lie proven to be absolutely a total lie,51420,51519
123,Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation,51819,51891
124,And by the way she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning,52190,52268
125,And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil,52565,52645
126,And you know what? We don’t blockade we don’t bomb we don’t do anything about it,52952,53032
127,It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening which could be a fact and could be true,53332,53436
128,This will all change when I become president,53746,53790
129,To our friends and allies I say America is going to be strong again,54116,54183
130,America is going to be reliable again,54508,54545
131,It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again,54901,54949
132,It’s going to be a friend again,55309,55340
133,We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies,55701,55823
134, Applause We’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world,56166,56280
135,Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge,56658,56735
136,We need a new rational American foreign policy informed by the best minds and supported by both parties and it will be by both parties — Democrats Republicans independents everybody as well as by our close allies,57034,57246
137,This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles which may be many which may be complex but we will win if I become president,57452,57610
138, Applause First we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam,57862,57947
139,Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world,58249,58365
140,Events may require the use of military force but it’s also a philosophical struggle like our long struggle in the Cold War,58656,58778
141,In this we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence attacks and everything else,59040,59205
142,It is a dangerous world more dangerous now than it has ever been,59487,59551
143,We should work — thank you,59893,59919
144, Applause We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam,60243,60353
145,But this has to be a two-way street,60648,60683
146,They must also be good to us,61012,61040
147,Remember that,61393,61406
148,They have to be good to us no longer one way,61739,61783
149,It’s now two-way,62120,62136
150,And remember us and all we’re doing they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them,62466,62549
151,We’re going to help but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them,62857,62929
152,The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland,63280,63347
153,There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism,63721,63798
154,For every case known to the public there are dozens and dozens more,64175,64242
155,We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,64635,64706
156,We have no idea where these people are coming from,65101,65151
157,There’s no documentation,65555,65579
158,There’s no paperwork,65997,66017
159,There’s nothing,66426,66441
160,We have to be smart,66843,66862
161,We have to be vigilant,67259,67281
162,A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly much worse,67625,67719
163,All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th one of the great catastrophes in my opinion the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened and citizens were attacked as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes,67913,68273
164,And then there’s ISIS,68499,68520
165,I have a simple message for them,68886,68918
166,Their days are numbered,69283,69306
167,I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how,69671,69720
168,We must …  Applause … we must as a nation be more unpredictable,70061,70123
169,We are totally predictable,70472,70498
170,We tell everything,70889,70907
171,We’re sending troops,71297,71317
172,We tell them,71702,71714
173,We’re sending something else,72100,72128
174,We have a news conference,72509,72534
175,We have to be unpredictable,72919,72946
176,And we have to be unpredictable starting now,73334,73378
177,But they’re going to be gone,73761,73789
178,ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president,74165,74207
179,And they’ll be gone quickly,74605,74632
180,They will be gone very very quickly,75031,75066
181, Applause Secondly we have to rebuild our military and our economy,75455,75520
182,The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability but look at what’s happened to us,75889,75995
183,Our nuclear weapons arsenal our ultimate deterrent has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal,76339,76473
184,And it has to happen immediately,76835,76867
185,Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today,77218,77308
186,The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time,77626,77710
187,The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991,78053,78103
188,Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today,78479,78523
189,These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room,78896,78956
190,And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011,79274,79437
191,Our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming,79726,79831
192,We will spend what we need to rebuild our military,80177,80227
193,It is the cheapest single investment we can make,80606,80654
194,We will develop build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind,81029,81099
195,Our military dominance must be unquestioned and I mean unquestioned by anybody and everybody,81447,81539
196,But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely,81890,81945
197,In this time of mounting debt right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem,82255,82365
198,But I do,82684,82692
199,No one dollar can be wasted,83058,83085
200,Not one single dollar can we waste,83441,83475
201,We’re also going to have to change our trade immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again,83805,83916
202,And to put Americans first again,84241,84273
203,This will ensure that our own workers right here in America get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues increase our economic might as a nation make us strong financially again,84581,84773
204,So so important,85094,85109
205,We need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority and nobody comes close gives us an edge,85487,85599
206,This includes 3D printing artificial intelligence and cyber warfare,85964,86031
207, A great country also takes care of its warriors,86439,86486
208,Our commitment to them is absolute and I mean absolute,86879,86933
209,A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve,87263,87401
210,And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life,87684,87784
211,Our veterans …  Applause … our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly,88079,88156
212,These are our great people and we must treat them fairly,88500,88556
213,We must even treat them really really well and that will happen under the Trump administration,88913,89007
214, Applause Finally we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests,89364,89441
215,Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries,89795,89890
216,Look at what happened in the 1990s,90250,90284
217,Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible period of time for us — were attacked and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole,90570,90718
218,And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade Organization which has been a total disaster for the United States,90946,91100
219,Frankly we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida,91374,91441
220,We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do it,91742,91816
221,And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,92116,92178
222,Again the worst attack on our country in its history,92516,92568
223,Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests,92899,92983
224,And the following will be my priorities,93346,93385
225,In the Middle East our goals must be and I mean must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability not radical change,93723,93849
226,We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies,94150,94241
227,And believe me we have groups that no matter what you do they will be the enemy,94554,94633
228,We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are who those people are and not help them,94915,95014
229,And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends,95309,95385
230, Applause We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China,95721,95798
231,We have serious differences with these two nations and must regard them with open eyes but we are not bound to be adversaries,96118,96243
232,We should seek common ground based on shared interests,96582,96636
233,Russia for instance has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism,97022,97087
234,I believe an easing of tensions an improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible absolutely possible,97442,97572
235,Common sense says this cycle this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon,97902,97998
236,Good for both countries,98369,98392
237,Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable,98777,98818
238,I intend to find out,99197,99217
239,If we can’t make a deal under my administration a deal that’s great — not good great — for America but also good for Russia then we will quickly walk from the table,99504,99668
240,It’s as simple as that,99954,99976
241,We’re going to find out,100361,100384
242,Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating a even more prosperous period of time,100732,100856
243,China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically which they are doing like never before we have lost all of their respect,101148,101298
244,We have a massive trade deficit with China a deficit that we have to find a way quickly and I mean quickly to balance,101562,101679
245,A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China better than we have right now,101936,102046
246,Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea,102340,102390
247,They’re not supposed to be doing it,102724,102759
248,No respect for this country or this president,103104,103149
249,We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways,103469,103524
250,If need be that’s what’s going to have to happen,103845,103893
251,After I’m elected president I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies,104192,104314
252,In these summits we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges,104574,104746
253,For instance we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges including migration and Islamic terrorism,105002,105189
254, Applause I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative,105502,105584
255,But if America fights it must only fight to win,105948,105995
256, Applause I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary and I mean absolutely necessary and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V,106277,106442
257, Applause Our goal is peace and prosperity not war and destruction,106724,106789
258,The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined deliberate and consistent foreign policy,107146,107247
259,With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless rudderless and aimless foreign policy one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake,107561,107737
260,After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever ever ever before,108001,108138
261,I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton,108458,108540
262,It has been a complete and total disaster,108917,108958
263,I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources,109350,109412
264,Financial leverage and sanctions can be very very persuasive but we need to use them selectively and with total determination,109760,109885
265,Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules,110212,110269
266,In other words if they do not treat us fairly,110586,110631
267,Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand I will enforce that line in the sand,110926,111030
268,Believe me,111356,111366
269, Applause However unlike other candidates for the presidency war and aggression will not be my first instinct,111738,111846
270,You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy,112215,112265
271,A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength,112654,112740
272,Although not in government service I was totally against the war in Iraq very proudly saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East,113071,113220
273,Sadly I was correct and the biggest beneficiary has been Iran who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very very rich oil reserves something it has wanted to do for decades,113473,113671
274,And now to top it off we have ISIS,113956,113990
275,My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations,114332,114413
276,That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war,114676,114957
277,We have to look to new people,115236,115265
278, Applause We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television,115538,115745
279,Finally I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions,116034,116117
280,Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions,116445,116709
281, Applause These are my goals as president,117058,117098
282,I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans whatever their party can support so important and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome,117454,117613
283,The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies that’s what we want,117863,118040
284,We want them to be our allies,118302,118331
285,We want the world to be our — we want to bring peace to the world,118663,118728
286,Too much destruction out there too many destructive weapons,119047,119106
287,The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world,119445,119528
288,To achieve these goals Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership,119887,119976
289,Again many Americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own,120320,120467
290,Americans …  Applause … Americans must know that we’re putting the American people first again on trade,120807,120909
291, Applause So true,121304,121320
292,On trade on immigration on foreign policy,121741,121782
293,The jobs incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority,122158,122243
294, Applause No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first,122587,122668
295,Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we while being fair to them must start doing the same,122983,123104
296,We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism,123415,123500
297,The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony,123851,123921
298,I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter…  Applause And under my administration we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs,124219,124453
299, Applause NAFTA as an example has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states — literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs,124683,124851
300,And I’ve just gotten to see it,125161,125191
301,I’ve toured Pennsylvania,125567,125591
302,I’ve toured New York,125976,125996
303,I’ve toured so many of the states,126372,126405
304,They have been cleaned out,126780,126806
305,Their manufacturing is gone,127177,127204
306,Never again only the reverse — and I have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen,127535,127641
307,We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones,127958,128001
308,There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later,128329,128427
309,They fire the people,128795,128815
310,They take advantage of the United States,129215,129255
311,There will be consequences for those companies,129650,129696
312,Never again,130110,130121
313,Under a Trump administration no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country,130481,130616
314, Applause I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests,130955,131043
315,I will be America’s greatest defender and most loyal champion,131408,131469
316,We will not apologize for becoming successful again but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are,131822,131943
317,The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest,132290,132362
318,America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker,132725,132798
319,We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself but to play that role we must make America strong again,133124,133237
320, Applause And always — always always we must make and we have to look at it from every angle and we have no choice we must make America respected again,133490,133640
321,We must make America truly wealthy again,133925,133965
322,And we must — we have to and we will make America great again,134269,134330
323,And if we do that — and if we do that perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever ever known,134630,134758
324,Thank you very much everybody,135147,135176
325,I appreciate it,135565,135580
326,Thank you,135969,135978
327, Applause Thank you very much,136367,136395
328, Applause Thank you,136784,136802
