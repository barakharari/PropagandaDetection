22,We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families safer communities and an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top,8957,9108
23,And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth this campaign really comes down to two questions,9392,9515
24,"What kind of future we want for ourselves our kids and our grandkids and how do we make it a reality?"" Now as I said it the other night – how many of you saw the debate? Well as I said I now have two grandchildren and no offense to anybody the two most wonderful amazing extraordinary",9691,9975
25,A little girl and a little boy,10187,10217
26,So I think a lot about the future,10558,10591
27,And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about – well nearly everything when it gets right down to it – not just about what makes America great because I think America already is great – but about what we should do to make it even greater and about that basic question about how progress happens at all,10793,11123
28,"""My opponent believes in what I call a strongman approach",11329,11386
29,He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless broken nation,11707,11786
30,I am sorry I am looking at you,12116,12146
31,I dont see that,12488,12503
32,That in no way resembles the strong vibrant America I know,12835,12893

34,He said I alone can fix it,13625,13651
35,"I alone?"" ""Well we have learned that thats his way",13994,14044
36,One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly,14396,14457
37,Thats why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much,14812,14870
38,But thats not how change happens in America,15245,15288
39,Its never just one person not even someone as powerful as the president,15663,15734
40,Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality,16058,16175
41,"Not just the wealthy or the powerful – all of us."" We see that every day across America and I bet many of you have been a part of it",16430,16562
42,Maybe you taught kids to read right? Or cleaned up your local park or the beach maybe you have organized a cancer walk or you have run a food drive,16771,16918
43,Whatever it is chances are you have done something to serve your community,17192,17266
44,And by extension your country,17602,17631
45,"""How many of you – just think back over your lives – how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community for other people",17926,18079
46,The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year,18318,18459
47,Its one of the best things about the American people,18764,18816
48,We are doers,19179,19191
49,We dont just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing we dont get resigned or pathetic or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats,19508,19677
50,"We roll up our sleeves we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood our community our city our state our country."" This has been our story the American story since the beginning of our nation and it is still going strong today",19864,20109
51,Now for many Americans including a lot of you here serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces,20330,20441
52,"People are starting to call out their services! ""There is no greater service or sacrifice and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform to their families and our veterans every single day",20699,20892
53,"But whats so great is that national service can take many different forms and its something that I believe in so deeply that every stage of our lives gives us the chance from grade school through grandparenthood to find a way to give back."" ""Weve got folks here today from AmeriCorps which my husband created back in 1993 and Ill tell you to this day it is one of his proudest achievements",21007,21396
54,Because very day AmeriCorps volunteers are out there,21575,21627
55,Theyre building houses responding to natural disasters helping people with disabilities find jobs find safe places to live and next week on October 7th AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member,21969,22192
56,Ill tell you Bill is really excited about this and so am I,22497,22555
57,And by the way AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard,22878,22961
58,Heres how it starts: I will get things done for America,23276,23331
59,"Isnt that great? I think we should make that a national slogan."" ""Now we also have folks here today from City Year which is part of AmeriCorps",23629,23771
60,And every day theyre working with students who are risk of dropping out of school,24075,24156
61,Theyre tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs – all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school,24444,24617
62,"Im really grateful to them."" We also have people here today from the Peace Corps which represents the best of America to the world",24871,25001
63,Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo staffing health centers in Nicaragua supporting farmers in Nepal distributing malaria nets in Uganda,25312,25466
64,Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State I got to see the results of their work first hand,25769,25863
65,They are making the world a healthier more prosperous and more peaceful place,26172,26249
66,Now maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs but I know you serve in different ways,26542,26647
67,"""Maybe you volunteer through your school or with your church or synagogue",26960,27033
68,Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities as I did when I was a teenager service opportunities,27373,27474
69,Because for many Americans service is part of our faith,27833,27888
70,My running mate Tim Kaine volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man and it changed his life,28238,28339
71,Or maybe your whole family volunteers together Bill and Chelsea and I every holiday season would work at a food bank back in Arkansas,28626,28759
72,However you serve it feels good doesnt it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves,29045,29133
73,"To take our time and labor and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world."" ""And you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier it makes us healthier and there are studies proving that",29396,29627
74,Its not just how we feel theyve actually followed people,29908,29964
75,It can also help us find our next job or our true calling in life,30300,30365
76,Its a smart way to use our greatest asset in life our people,30686,30746
77,And service does something important for us as a society,31072,31128
78,"Too often we Americans can become separated from each other and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election."" ""Its easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us talk like us look like us read the same news as us thats understandable to an extent",31373,31656
79,But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us,31834,31992
80,There arent many places where people of all ages all races all backgrounds all beliefs come together in common cause,32280,32396
81,"But service is one of them and thats one of the reasons I think its so valuable because in addition to the good work it does it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life."" ""I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service to help more Americans answer President Kennedys call",32555,32895
82,"You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country."" ""But sometimes its hard to figure out",33061,33191
83,How do you make a difference especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do,33443,33631
84,But thats not how it should be,33936,33966
85,"Everyone should be able to contribute."" ""So what if we as a country made it easier for everybody to do that for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasnt just something that we did one day a year but it became a regular part of our lives",34126,34594
86,"I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America."" ""I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation",34684,34832
87,Were not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy,35129,35218
88,"Were exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people."" ""Way back nearly 200 years ago a Frenchman came to the United States his name was Alexis de Tocqueville",35507,35683
89,He was travelling around trying to figure out What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution,35968,36077
90,Who are they? And he saw how we had set up our government and we had three branches and everything that our founders really put into place,36362,36500
91,But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible,36761,36909
92,If Im elected president this fall I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service,37181,37306
93,"So heres what I plan to do."" ""First lets triple AmeriCorps",37612,37670
94,That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy,37984,38048
95,It was laid out in a law named in his honor the Edward M,38357,38413
96,Kennedy Serve America Act,38754,38779
97,Its finally time we get it done,39142,39173
98,"Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program so if we grow the program from 75000 annual members to 250000 were going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so."" ""Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because with their student loans they cant afford it",39281,39856
99,So lets lighten that burden,39984,40011
100,If you do national service we will begin a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country,40356,40472
101,"And lets keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to."" ""Now second lets grow the Peace Corps",40726,40882
102,Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago its given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime and its fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations,41112,41337
103,Weve got to do more of that in the world today,41617,41663
104,We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values serving people,42016,42101
105,"So lets make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program."" ""Third lets expand service opportunities for people of all ages",42398,42550
106,Right? Now lets be fair the younger generation is way ahead on this,42867,42934
107,Ive talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world,43265,43374
108,Service isnt just something to do to check a box before graduation it really is woven into your lives,43672,43773
109,"And many who are just getting started in your careers say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes may pay a salary but doesnt give you any meaning or purpose in your lives."" ""Now I also want to get older Americans more involved",43976,44244
110,Service isnt something only students and young people do,44474,44530
111,I know that,44899,44910
112,So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55,45254,45349
113,"Lets give people an encore opportunity after theyve ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community."" ""And finally I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious meaningful ways without a full time commitment",45583,45864
114,AmeriCorps is a full time commitment,46128,46164
115,The Peace Corps is a full time commitment,46541,46582
116,The Armed Forces are a full time commitment,46955,46998
117,But the Armed Forces has another model,47388,47426
118,The Reserves – right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways,47754,47906
119,So lets do something like that in the civilian space,48224,48276
120,"Lets call it the National Service Reserve."" ""And heres the idea",48648,48711
121,If you join the National Service Reserve you will receive some basic training just like you would in the military reserves and then when your city or state needs you youll get the call,49002,49186
122,Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck,49457,49529
123,Or maybe like the crisis in Flint and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families,49818,49920
124,Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health,50206,50310
125,You will then be sent into action,50630,50663
126,Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days a month some might be longer term,50992,51084
127,"But they will directly address a vital need in your own community."" ""And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student having a job taking care of your family",51324,51533
128,You wont have to make service your only priority,51807,51855
129,Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states and we will have an open door to people of all ages but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 whove said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities but they cant leave their jobs understandably,52059,52349
130,"Well work with governors and mayors Republicans and Democrats because I want this to be a true bipartisan public-private partnership."" ""I also want to include businesses colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer",52529,52759
131,And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution their schools and their employers will have their backs,53040,53180
132,I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states,53488,53575
133,Theres so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it,53896,53968
134,"So lets bridge that divide get people working together in ways that can help communities."" ""Now I dont think youll hear anything about this from my opponent",54247,54403
135,And you know what? I think thats a shame because national service has always been a bipartisan goal,54704,54803
136,Of course President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps – but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act,55136,55285
137,President George H.W,55673,55693
138,Bush created the White House Office of National Service,56113,56168
139,And both President George W,56577,56604
140,Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service,57001,57061
141,This should be something that we all can get behind,57427,57478
142,And when you listen to whats being said in this campaign it can be discouraging right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where whenever we can,57738,57946
143,Now I am well aware that candidates dont usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election,58185,58320
144,Some might say Well hey my gosh youve only got 39 days to go,58618,58678
145,Why arent you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well Ill do that but – Ive been thinking about this for a long time and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me,58851,59134
146,"Im trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart – and this is one of them."" Thank you! ""For me service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: Do all the good you can in all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the times you can to all the people you can as long as ever you can",59135,59552
147,Now Ive carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl and its an idea that really got into my head and my heart,59623,59757
148,But you know whats kept me going are the people that Ive met,60013,60073
149,And in a country founded on liberty and equality I cant think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable,60348,60469
150,We all deserve respect,60767,60789
151,We all should listen to each other,61125,61159
152,We all can make our mark on the world,61493,61530
153,"And when we come together in common purpose we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own."" ""Thats why Stronger Together is more than just a slogan",61798,61955
154,Its a course of action,62216,62238
155,So heres what I want to do,62566,62592
156,I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency,62895,62973
157,And I want you to help me bring our nation together – to solve our problems strengthen our communities,63260,63362
158,To join with people across America who care about service because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States,63656,63788
159,America is great because we are good,64116,64152
160,There are lots of examples,64532,64558
161,We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations,64874,64977
162,But I want everybody here to know that it can be done,65275,65328
163,"We can do more and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people."" ""There are so many examples in this community and communities across America – 39 days left",65615,65782
164,"This is the choice: do we lift each other up or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other or do we scapegoat point fingers and insult each other? Well Ill tell you what side Im going to be on and with your help were going to demonstrate on November 8th what kind of country we really are."" Thank you and God bless you!"" ",65914,66255
