3,I am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland,1247,1363
4,"""The Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary and its not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers",1646,1769

14,Some of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania and I am excited about helping in any way that we can for Pittsburgh Allegheny county and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together,5615,5916
15,I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine,6156,6195
16,I asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest toughest most qualified vice presidents we have ever had,6486,6623
17,And I also knew he had never lost an election,6891,6936
18,I kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit,7250,7305
19,Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country,7542,7728
20,He is not just smart tough and qualified Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet,7958,8061
21,I am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign,8340,8399
22,Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country and particularly here in Pennsylvania,8687,8815
23,"""But both of us unlike our opponent do not believe we can do this alone",9100,9171
24,We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you,9480,9546
25,And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about its going to be on the ballot,9784,9961
26,"It may not be listed but it will be on the ballot."" Whether you care about new good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down",10128,10349
27,What ever it is you care about it is literally going to be on that ballot,10564,10637
28,"""Now my name and Tims name may be the ones on the ballot but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country",10885,11033
29,"And were going to need help doing that after the election and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty your next senator."" You know Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer",11230,11448
30,I think she is one of 10 children right? One of 10 children,11699,11758
31,She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families,12095,12163
32,I have known her now for more than 20 years when she was really young and I have seen that same can-do spirit,12472,12581
33,She just gets up every day and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods to keep our kids and healthy to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water to help people make the most out of their own lives,12793,13005
34,Now she is running for the senate because like Tim and I she believes our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top,13209,13341
35,"""Katie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate",13630,13689
36,But more importantly she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate,14011,14127
37,"We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America and Katie will help us break through the gridlock actually make a difference in peoples lives help us create more good jobs with rising incomes guarantee equal pay for women defending planned parenthood."" ""And I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katies opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump."" ""A lot of republicans have",14282,14702
38,"They have had the grit to stand up and say he does not represent me."" ""But Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq",14813,14973
39,He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists he heard him say terrible things about women,15248,15342
40,"He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasnt really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesnt have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests?"" ""So you know when I look at this Im thinking to myself we have work to do in Washington",15493,15878
41,And I know its not easy,16037,16060
42,I understand we have some real challenges,16391,16432
43,I believe we can do it,16760,16782
44,I would not be standing here Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first who get up every day thinking about middle-class families who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life,16913,17368
45,"That is who you should be electing people who care about you your families your children."" Now as Tim said he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday",17429,17590
46,Well I will tell you that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump,17838,17931
47,I mean think about this I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief,18161,18318
48,"""And after every one of those debates people have said how did you do that? And really you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that",18532,18700
49,You are in front of 50 60 70 80 million people,18944,18990
50,So no matter what he would say I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign,19276,19381
51,Just early today Ive met Henry over there,19669,19710
52,"Henry is on top of his dads shoulders and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president and you know I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you."" You know I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me",19886,20202
53,From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015 people have been telling me what is on their minds and it is one of the greatest honors,20334,20483
54,"""You know sometimes it is just fleeting",20759,20798
55,I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line just running into somebody,21088,21206
56,And that person that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop looks into my eyes,21457,21553
57,I can tell they are trying to take my measure and I am grateful that they take their vote their choice so seriously,21824,21939
58,And then they might say something like I have a really terrible problem in my family,22221,22305
59,My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin,22611,22676
60,What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say my brother has schizophrenia and we cant afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs ,22943,23096
61,Or maybe they will say I am a diabetic,23363,23401
62,And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin and I cant afford it,23710,23787
63,"What are you going to do about it?"" That is the right question to ask anybody running for president because at the end of the day this is about you",24035,24182
64,As I said the other night we are going to invest in the middle class,24434,24502
65,We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down,24771,24859
66,And we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you,25089,25306
67,"""Now Ive got to say I believe in hard work",25547,25589
68,That is how I was raised,25907,25931
69,I believe youve got to work for what you get in life,26226,26278
70,But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should,26525,26657
71,"For me that starts by believing in our country."" You know there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many",26878,27039
72,Do we have problems? We have problems,27319,27356
73,Do we have challenges? Of course we do,27709,27747
74,We are human beings,28105,28124
75,But boy there is no more blessed place,28483,28521
76,And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party,28848,28959
77,He refused to say he would respect the results of this election,29284,29347
78,"""Make no mistakes about this my friends",29705,29744
79,He is threatening our democracy,30141,30172
80,Look I have lost elections,30577,30603
81,You dont feel very good the next day believe me,30982,31029
82,"But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship right?"" You know the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart and whether you support me or my opponent together we must show we support American democracy",31291,31554
83,And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us,31784,31892
84,And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote,32205,32290
85,And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now,32619,32699
86,We have just reached a milestone more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election,33019,33123
87,And you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people,33439,33511
88,More than ever before,33872,33893
89,I find that a very hopeful sign,34267,34298
90,And here in Pennsylvania hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012,34630,34724
91,What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there something exciting is happening right now,35023,35151
92,People are coming together -- democrats republicans independents -- all to reject hate and division,35468,35567
93,And in the states where they can people are motivated to vote early to defend core American values and embrace a future where every person counts everyone has a place everyone can contribute,35877,36067
94,You see despite what Donald Trump may think most Americans really believe we can do better,36368,36458
95,Most Americans really believe women should be respected,36847,36902
96,Most Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly,37291,37355
97,Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe,37701,37810
98,The energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election,38107,38206
99,It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children,38484,38574
100,And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters,38857,38932
101,I want you to know if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president we will work with everyone,39203,39322
102,Now I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump,39581,39724
103,And here is what I want you to tell them,40016,40056
104,I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them will listen to them and I want to be their president too,40333,40479
105,Because whether you agree or disagree with me whether you vote for me or vote against me I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable,40723,40864
106,I have seen that,41163,41179
107,I know it can happen,41535,41555
108,And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions,41867,41952
109,They want to know how do we move forward better,42247,42294
110,They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more,42566,42672
111,They are upset what they see around them,42931,42971
112,I get that,43304,43314
113,But anger is not a plan,43655,43678
114,"""And we need -- we need to work together",44000,44040
115,We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania,44348,44460
116,I think that is what our whole country needs right now,44755,44809
117,Thats what I will try to do,45149,45176
118,I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems,45505,45582
119,That does not happen in the real world,45892,45930
120,But I know we can make progress together,46263,46303
121,"The choice we face in this election is stark especially when it comes to the economy."" ""Tim and I believe when the middle class thrives America thrives",46610,46761
122,And when we invest in working families in the middle class in small businesses we can make the economy work again for everybody,47040,47167
123,I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective,47467,47559
124,They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires billionaires corporations it will all trickle down to everybody else,47793,48001
125,It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right,48197,48358
126,Married to one thats right,48625,48651
127,"Worked for one."" And here is what I know",48986,49026
128,That when you focus on helping the middle class you end up lifting everybody,49348,49424
129,When you focus on helping the top you help the top,49733,49783
130,That is not good enough,50122,50145
131,Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story,50479,50575
132,Yes he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects,50903,50983
133,He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs,51352,51429
134,"""I would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania",51773,51944
135,And for all his talk about putting America first he has made many of his products in 12 different countries,52240,52347
136,So if he wants to make America great again why doesnt he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasnt paid a dime in federal income taxes for years,52578,52755
137,He says that makes him smart,53006,53034
138,Well I dont know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place,53314,53410
139,"Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business?"" Never could figure that out",53660,53791
140,But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has,54058,54161
141,That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks,54457,54527
142,"""I will tell you what",54855,54876
143,It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military zero for our vets zero for pell grants to help young people go to college zero for our highways zero for everything,55161,55343
144,And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America,55620,55672
145,Well its unfair and its wrong,56028,56057
146,With your help we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II jobs in infrastructure,56395,56499
147,"Our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our water systems all need help and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done jobs that cant be exported out of Pennsylvania."" I believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States",56720,56968
148,That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses universities and community colleges,57172,57338
149,Some countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries,57672,57740
150,Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing,58119,58177
151,We invented both of those technologies,58571,58609
152,We should take the lead and we should have the jobs,58994,59045
153,"""We are also going to fight climate change with clean renewable energy jobs",59393,59468
154,And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America,59774,59878
155,And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits,60185,60289
156,Dont let anybody fool you my friends,60626,60662
157,"assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class."" It is time to say loudly and clearly right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America",60960,61125
158,"""So I have set some big goals",61394,61423
159,I am excited about what we are going to do,61735,61777
160,And its all going to put people to work right here,62083,62133
161,And sometimes folks say to me how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress —well first of all I hope we will elect some or democrats,62386,62532
162,That will be job number one,62809,62836
163,Number two I think it will be a very simple question,63152,63204
164,Our members of congress members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich the powerful and the wealthy or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question,63452,63645
165,Because if they stay beholden to the special interest if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate,63841,64027
166,I have seen it,64298,64312
167,I know it,64671,64680
168,"If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America then I want to make sure that they dont come back to Washington after the next election."" We are in a great great high school here and I am so proud to be here",64910,65161
169,And so we are going to be a good partner with education especially with educators,65353,65434
170,We are going to start with universal pre-k,65755,65797
171,We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education,66117,66216
172,And I want us to bring technical education back to high school,66529,66591
173,I think it was a mistake when we took it out,66910,66954
174,"""There are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in todays economy -- coming out of high school maybe going to community college going into an apprenticeship program and I want to lift up that work",67216,67423
175,"A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life."" We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125000 a year",67581,67827
176,And we are going to help you pay down your college debt,68069,68124
177,"""Its going to be great",68454,68476
178,To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford,68750,68874
179,"I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders and its going to help save -- its going to help save people thousands of dollars."" In fact after a year maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com/calculator to see how much your family can save",69051,69309
180,We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you,69544,69603
181,"""I mean ultimately its pretty simple",69948,69984

185,We are as Tim said going to guarantee equal pay for women,71422,71479
186,You know look its not just a womans issue,71780,71821
187,If you have a mother which all of us do -- if you have a mother a wife a daughter or a sister whos working its your issue,72079,72200
188,"Its good for the entire family its good for our economy."" ""So my friends there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days",72413,72533

191,And thats where all of you come in,73519,73553
192,"If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent.""  Nope!  Well you may",73864,73953
193,You know I hope you will stage an intervention,74274,74320

200,And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did as our parents and grandparents did because maybe they came from somewhere else where they werent treated right,76861,77035
201,"Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law."" ""You know every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent meaning me I think to myself you know we dont do that in America",77250,77458
