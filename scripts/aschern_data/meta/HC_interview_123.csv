0, Well have my interview this morning with Donald Trump in just a few minutes,0,75
1,But were going to begin with the Democrats and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton,468,556
2,"You liked that ""graveyard of pollsters"" line didnt you? "" Well Ive lived through this twice —"" "" Youve lived through this."" "" — in 92 and 2008",913,1055
3,And look I know Im behind,1354,1379
4,"And Im going to keep fighting until the very last vote is counted because I care about this primary.""  Why do you think you started with such a big deficit this time considering — look this has been a big state to both your husband and yourself very important",1611,1869
5, Yes,2132,2135
6,""" Theyve always helped you."" "" Well look I cant sit here and analyze all the reasons",2480,2564
7,Obviously one is that the senator has been in public life next door for 25 years,2863,2943
8,So theres a familiarity with him,3273,3305
9,I totally respect that,3671,3693
10,And I just think that whats great about this primary is New Hampshire voters take a first second third fourth fifth look,4019,4139
11,I mean yesterday as I was crisscrossing from one side of the state to the other talking to voters I literally had people come up say you changed my mind you know who knows,4388,4559
12,I mean this is whats so exciting about the primary Chuck,4817,4873
13,I came in in 2008 as I recall like 16 points behind,5194,5245
14,I remember the night before the primary in 92 Bills pollster saying you know youre in single digits,5543,5642
15,Its over,5967,5975
16,Who knows,6325,6334
17,I love this excitement,6675,6697
18,And you know Im going to fight as hard as I can,7028,7075
19,"But Im having a great time whatever happens.""  All right",7387,7442
20,Lets — I want to go to the debate a little bit because I would say the foreign policy section is one that you guys wanted to highlight because you felt as if he didnt do so well,7686,7863
21,You brought up Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to talk about it,8117,8186
22,But some of the things that you said about Senator Obamas readiness on foreign policy they are very similar to what youve said about Bernie Sanders,8479,8626
23,"In 08 you said ""I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House",8897,8981
24,"I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House."" Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002; it sounds very similar to what you said when youre like OK you had one vote on the Iraq war —  Well you know what — "" Whats the difference between what you said about then- Senator Obama and what youre saying about Senator Sanders?"" "" Theres a very big difference",9125,9522
25,In 2008 Senator Obama had really done his homework in the Senate,9683,9747
26,Hed been there by that time a few years,10110,10149
27,He had developed a network of advisors on national security and foreign policy issues,10487,10572
28,They were very diligent and focused on making sure he was ready that he had as broad a set of views as possible,10866,10977
29,And they really went toe-to-toe with all the people supporting me,11305,11370
30,Thats not happening in this campaign,11736,11772
31,There really isnt any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Senator Sanders,12121,12221
32,Ill let him speak for himself,12573,12602
33,I think that whats important is this job requires you to be ready on all aspects of it on the first day,12927,13030
34,And we know we got a particularly complex world right now,13338,13395
35,And the presidents not going to have the time,13733,13778
36,Maybe previous presidents in past years could have a little more leeway because of you know the way the world functioned,14105,14225
37,But now its North Korea with its missile tests its Russian aggression its enforcing the Iran agreement,14531,14633
38,"You have to do it all at once.""  Do you think the Iraq vote should still matter to voters? "" Look I think that voters are perfectly free to take into account anything they want to take",14893,15076
39,But I also hope theyll take the rest of the record,15333,15383
40,You know I was involved in the biggest counterterrorism decision in the Obama administration to determine whether or not to go after bin Laden,15692,15834
41,I did put the sanctions on Iran to get them to the negotiating table,16128,16196
42,"I think that this is a debate that the voters really have to pay attention to because it is choosing both a president and a commander in chief."" "" Im curious do you believe if it wasnt for the Iraq War we wouldnt have ISIS today?"" "" Well I think thats a hard conclusion to draw because remember we had Al Qaeda before we had ISIS",16372,16701
43,Al Qaeda attacked us in New York,16892,16924
44,"Al Qaeda attacked our embassies in Africa —""   "" The argument is that the instability in Iraq is what has created this and that if we — that if Saddam Hussein were still there we wouldnt have ISIS."" "" Well I think thats a lot of jumps in logic that to me doesnt really add up",17141,17414
45,The Iraq War theres no doubt contributed to instability,17624,17679
46,Im not going to in any way deny that,18003,18039
47,But you cannot draw a direct line,18381,18414
48,"What you can do is to say that jihadist terrorism starting with Al Qaeda —""  Right",18742,18823
49,""" — and moving onto its latest incarnations most particularly ISIS is in response to a number of forces and factors that are roiling up the Middle East",19096,19247
50,"And certainly fighting for what Islam means and how its going to be presented and what people are going to mean when they talk about it — so yes weve got a much bigger set of problems."" "" All right",19455,19652
51,Another thing I wanted to follow up on the debate,19902,19951
52,Senator Sanders called the entire business model of Wall Street a fraud,20260,20331
53,We didnt get a chance to ask you to respond directly to that critique,20636,20705
54,"Id like to ask you to respond to it now."" "" Well I think its the kind of extreme statement that once you really take a hard look at it its hard to understand",20940,21097
55,You know when you talk about Wall Street are we talking about every bank? Or are we talking about a particular part of New York? Thats never really clarified,21312,21469
56,What I believe is that there are good actors and bad actors in every part of our economy,21738,21826
57,The job of the president is to weed out and prevent the bad actors from disrupting economic activity from amassing too much power and influence,22114,22257
58,But we live in a complex global economy where weve got to have a good banking system that is able to service the American economy,22532,22661
59,And it needs to be more than just looking at the five banks that are the big banks,22923,23005
60,We have to have a much more robust community banking system regional banking system other forms of credit access,23303,23415
61,And thats what I am advocating for,23746,23780
62,"And I still do not understand why Im having this problem getting Senator Sanders to join me in going after what are the potential problems that are out there the shadow banking sector and the investment and hedge fund sector."" "" Do you — can you have a Treasury Secretary who isnt familiar with how Wall Street works? And I say this because I think theres so much distrust right now.""  Yes",23973,24361
63,There is,24554,24562
64,There is,24943,24951
65,""" On Wall Street",25326,25342
66,Six of the last Treasury Secretaries either came from Wall Street or went to Wall Street after,25682,25776
67,I think there certainly right now isnt an appetite for somebody from Wall Street to be the next Treasury Secretary,26077,26191
68,"And yet can you have a Treasury Secretary if they dont understand Wall Street?""  Well you have to have a Treasury Secretary who understands the economy the American economy and the global economy",26468,26662
69,"I think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury Secretary —    Do you think you can pick one without having them have a Wall Street background? "" You know I want somebody who can make a good commitment to work with me to get the economy moving to get more good jobs created to get incomes rising to look out over the horizon at some of the economic problems that are out there",26746,27157
70,Weve got to figure out what were going to do with China,27298,27353
71,China is finally having to come to grips with the fact that a lot of its growth may not have been as on a firm foundation as we would hope,27604,27742
72,So we need people in government who have that kind of commitment and understanding,27998,28080
73,But weve got to put the needs of the American economy first,28379,28438
74,"And thats going to be my commitment."" "" Before I let you go I want to ask you about a comment Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said — a comment that Ive heard her say before",28702,28887
75,But it sort of rang differently to a lot of people,29143,29193
76,She said theres a special place in hell for women who dont help women,29528,29597
77,"But the implication is that somehow if youre a Democratic woman and youre not supporting you whats wrong with you? Do you want the vote to be decided on gender lines like that?""  Oh look you know as you remember Madeleine has been saying this for many many years",29824,30085
78, Starbucks cups I think centers on that,30324,30362
79,I get that,30713,30723
80,""" She believes it firmly and",31077,31105
81,in part because she knows what a struggle it has been,31438,31491
82,And she understands the struggle is not over,31819,31863
83,"So I dont want people to be offended by what she is expressing as her very —""  You can understand why some might have been offended by it? "" Well good grief were getting offended about everything these days",32121,32326
84,Honest to goodness I mean people cant say anything without offending somebody,32605,32682
85,She has a life experience that I respect,33036,33076
86,I admire her greatly,33449,33469
87,And I think what she was trying to do which shes done in every setting Ive ever seen her in going back 20-plus years was to remind young women particularly that this struggle which many of us have been part of is not over,33745,33966
88,And dont be in any way lulled by the progress weve made,34200,34255
89,"And I think it was a light-hearted but very pointed remark which people can take however they choose.""  All right",34548,34660
90,"What do you got in the Super Bowl? "" I dont have anybody right now."" "" You dont have anybody?"" "" Im going to Flint Michigan Im worrying about the kids in Flint Michigan trying to figure out what were going to do to make sure theyre not damaged irreparably by this —"" "" So youre going today you could have gone Wednesday",34825,35144
91,"That says something about how you feel about New Hampshire?"" "" I love New Hampshire",35339,35422
92,And you know the mayor asked me to come,35744,35783
93,This was as early as we could get it done,36110,36151
94,I want to lend my support,36481,36506
95,Im very hopeful the Congress which is trying to work in a bipartisan way will come up with some funding to deal with these problems that have afflicted the community,36784,36949
96,"And Im going to keep doing everything I can to help them.""  Secretary Clinton I know you got a plane to catch",37298,37406
97, Thanks,37783,37789
98,Great to talk to you,38166,38186
