1,"""And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular I want to thank all of the elected officials",486,592

5,Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami,2279,2326
6,Thanks to all the others who were part of the program,2670,2723
7,As we were coming in we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd and I was told as I was coming out theres an overflow but they can hear us in the overflow and were so happy youre here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd,2936,3164
8,"But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the worlds most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore."" ""About a decade ago Al made a movie called An Inconvenient Truth",3315,3500
9,Now maybe some of you have seen it but if you havent I hope youll watch it tonight,3737,3819
10,"It doesnt have a lot of special effects – but it does have a lot of drama."" ""And heres the main message: climate change is real its urgent and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it",4038,4236
11,Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions,4493,4557
12,We can transform our economy,4927,4955
13,We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution,5322,5368
14,"And above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren."" ""Now let me just say – so so lets remember lets remember whats at stake",5663,5847
15,Im running against a guy who denies science denies climate change claims its a hoax created by the Chinese,6114,6220
16,So this is something that Al Gores been working on for a really long time,6508,6581
17,And I want you to know how far back he goes,6897,6940
18,It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen,7229,7380
19,And then when Al became a senator he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions and as vice president he led Americas efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions,7637,7835
20,"You take all this together those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007."" I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent and in the face of a lot of people – in public life in business in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science – he never wavered",7972,8302
21,And in the years since the climate challenge has only grown more stark,8480,8550
22,And I will tell you this it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election,8858,8947
23,Look at it this way,9274,9293
24,Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change to protect our planet to protect our health and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy,9583,9789
25,Or in the alternative we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk,10050,10141
26,"""So weve really got to get this right",10481,10518
27,And if you need additional convincing just remember what happened this week,10866,10941
28,Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti,11254,11370
29,North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week if not longer,11636,11749
30,"We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster."" ""Thats why Ive encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew or to UNICEF helping children and families on the ground in Haiti."" ""Now some will say Weve always had hurricanes",11900,12322
31,Theyve always been destructive,12543,12573
32,And thats true,13015,13029
33,But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change,13442,13517
34,Right now the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures – and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas,13856,14016
35,"Sea levels have already risen about a foot – one foot – in much of the Southeast which means that Matthews storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe."" ""Plus as you know the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes",14215,14469
36,Its become a daily reality here in Miami,14739,14779
37,You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide,15138,15218
38,The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system,15577,15626
39,"Sometimes people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them."" ""So if you need proof that climate change is real and that its costly there you go",15905,16112
40,So at this rate at this rate my friends my friends please,16368,16425
41,Lets focus on whats really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country because this is what I want you to hear and understand,16693,16850
42,"At the rate we are going one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century and when kids – like that adorable young boy over there on his dads shoulders – are grandparents we believe thats more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk and nationwide its as much as $882 billion in property at risk."" ""But theres also health consequences",16971,17347
43,Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges,17526,17637
44,And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse which is especially bad for our children,17977,18100
45,And look at what is happening in California a brutal five-year drought,18447,18517
46,"Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year."" ""And its also about national security",18874,18986
47,The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our Americas national security,19343,19431
48,The U.S,19832,19839
49,Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk Virginia,20244,20287
50,Its the largest naval installation in the world,20681,20728
51,And because of rising sea level the base is frequently flooded even when its sunny,21102,21184
52,"So thats why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations not just in Norfolk but at all of our military bases around the world."" ""So you would think if you look at the facts if you listen to the science that even the most committed climate skeptic would say Ok I agree somethings happening here",21395,21728
53,"We need to take it seriously."" ""But unfortunately there are still plenty of people – in Washington on the campaign trail – who wont face whats happening right in front of us."" ""Donald Trump is quote not a big believer in climate change",21865,22100
54,As I said he said its a hoax created by the Chinese,22333,22384
55,And in our first debate two weeks ago he tried to deny saying that,22691,22757
56,"But that tweet is still there for everyone to see."" ""And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida like Miami Beachs Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these Sunny Day Floods",23005,23247
57,Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemán,23525,23599
58,Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemán,23988,24062
59,John Elizabeth is a Republican but shes supporting our campaign—because she knows America cant afford a candidate who doesnt accept climate science,24425,24572
60,"Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security or what about the ranchers in Colorado or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say Our lives and jobs and families are being affected – please lets come together as a country and do something about it."" We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House",24743,25136
61,At all that is absolutely unacceptable,25327,25365
62,We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat creating good jobs and yes saving our planet,25671,25816
63,"""So heres what I want to do."" First we need to do a lot more on clean energy",26071,26147
64,The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany China or us—and I want it to be us,26398,26519
65,And I want you to be part of making it us,26795,26836
66,And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines,27143,27297
67,Modernizing our electric grid,27647,27676
68,Retrofitting buildings,28098,28120
69,Building resilient 21st century infrastructure and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind—not our cities or our small towns or our remote rural areas,28477,28648
70,"""Now you wouldnt know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is",28915,29013
71,He has such a dark divisive view of America but that doesnt tell the story about whats really going on,29308,29410
72,Its actually pretty exciting,29758,29786
73,In red states and blue states local leaders are stepping up,30176,30235
74,Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America – union workers in Michigan union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy,30534,30758
75,Iowa Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind,31031,31096
76,Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie,31443,31501
77,Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America,31847,31924
78,"I think that is so exciting – there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency."" And in Spartanburg South Carolina a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm",32213,32435
79,That landfill was a blight and a health threat just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood,32714,32811
80,Now that same land will generate enough clean renewable electricity to power 500 homes,33135,33221
81,"""So this is what we can do",33565,33591
82,And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that,33949,34017
83,As president I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term,34332,34440
84,And lets generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade,34759,34849
85,"Lets make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third."" And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing putting big partnerships together between states cities and rural communities",35087,35458
86,"""We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do",35737,35808
87,So Im hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future,36120,36261
88,The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America,36582,36650
89,"We want them manufactured in America installed in America and putting people to work in America."" ""And while we do that lets make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us",36932,37154
90,We need to invest in resilient infrastructure,37448,37493
91,Now sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times lets be more creative – like in New York Harbor where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge,37807,37991
92,Sometimes well overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours,38302,38393
93,"In Philadelphia theyre trying something else: green roofs porous pavements curbside gardens to help absorb storm water."" ""And heres something we dont talk enough about",38750,38917
94,Lets make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster,39257,39339
95,Because sadly I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital because the electricity went off,39611,39822
96,Nurses I love nurses – heroic courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing,40085,40217
97,Now here in Miami you know how important this is,40572,40620
98,You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Childrens Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason,41003,41112
99,"And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience."" ""And then finally we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge",41431,41601
100,If we dont do it nobody will do it,41901,41935
101,We must confront the climate challenge,42291,42329
102,Theres no doubt about that,42696,42722
103,"And so lets move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves."" ""When I was Secretary of State I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority",43001,43207
104,We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution,43442,43566
105,In fact we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen Denmark – slip past the guards – it was all very cloak and dagger,43813,43933
106,But for a really important purpose and because of that breakthrough and a lot of patient persistent work and because of American leadership 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December,44192,44389
107,Its called the Paris Agreement,44703,44733
108,"And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last best chance to solve the global climate crisis."" ""And what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement",45038,45217
109,He doesnt care what it would do to the planet,45497,45542
110,He doesnt care how much that would damage American leadership in the world,45873,45947
111,"He doesnt care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids."" ""Well he may not care – but we do",46225,46342
112,And thats why this election is so critically important because on the ballot it is not just my name,46595,46694
113,"Its every issue we care about its our values as a country."" Climate change needs to be a voting issue",46961,47062
114,We need to elect people up and down the ballot at every level of government who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done,47312,47473
115,Please we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses—and certainly not to the White House,47753,47881
116,"""And if you care about climate your Senate race is also really important and Ill tell you why",48199,48292
117,It is unacceptable it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio when asked about climate change to say Im not a scientist,48586,48709
118,"Well why doesnt he ask a scientist and then maybe then hed understand why it is so important that he representing Florida be committed to climate change? Thats why I hope that youll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate."" ""Look we need leaders who can get results",48926,49200
119,Its easy to stonewall,49473,49494
120,Its not enough to protest: we need creativity we need hard work,49855,49918
121,"And when it comes to climate change we dont have a minute to waste."" ""So I know its easy to get cynical—especially about our politics",50219,50352
122,I get that,50664,50674
123,But this election matters more than any has in a really long time and I believe that as strongly as I can weve got to address this issue for our sakes our children our grandchildren,50967,51148
124,"And its so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference."" And just look if you will – look at the difference between your state the Sunshine State which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now",51347,51585
125,And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words climate change,51810,51933
126,So my friends this is a big deal in the election and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world,52174,52285
127,And there isnt anybody – there isnt anybody who knows more has done more has worked harder,52538,52628
128,I know he was in Miami just last year training and educating people to be climate change activists,52913,53011
129,I cant wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States,53352,53432
130,"So please join me in welcoming our former vice president a climate change leader and an all-around great guy Al Gore."" ",53833,53951
