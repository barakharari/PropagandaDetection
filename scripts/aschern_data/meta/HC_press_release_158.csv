0,The stories behind the votes Tens of millions of votes will be cast during the 2016 presidential election,0,105
1,"""And behind the vote totals the margins of victory and the delegate counts are the individual votes themselves",525,635
2,Each one of those votes tells a story,1036,1073
3,"A vote represents a persons beliefs concerns hopes and dreams for the future—and every person has his or her own journey to the ballot box."" n n I taught in Harlem",1375,1538
4,That job showed me the horrifying reality of the school-to-prison pipeline,1833,1907
5,We are on the verge of entering a world where we have the most unequal generation ever—and I am not talking about income inequality,2216,2347
6,I am talking about unequal in terms of opportunity for kids,2678,2737
7,And this inequality is sickening when you look at it from a racial perspective because it appears to me that black kids are being automatically set up to be fed through this pipeline—which sets them up for lifelong inequality,3013,3238
8,"""Before I started teaching I never understood what the school-to-prison pipeline even meant",3532,3623
9,But I had one student who was incredibly intelligent and I sort of saw it through him,3977,4062
10,A lot of what happened to him has to do with the structural inequalities that are in place in our laws policies and communities in general,4357,4495
11,But part of it is that black boys are not being educated in the same way that their peers are,4749,4842
12,I felt like the structures that were in place were resistant to African American male success,5159,5252
13,Everything was designed to prevent success even in the educational system,5599,5672
14,And community programs are doing great work—but its not enough with an issue like this,6032,6118
15,"In order to successfully address this issue you need a leader in the White House who is familiar with the issue and is willing to tackle these sorts of issues with policy."" ""Its absolutely a big part of why",6388,6594
16,I know that this is an issue that she cares about,6843,6892
17,She has worked on these issues and shes demonstrated that she has a familiarity with these issues that no other candidate has—on the Republican side or the Democratic side,7192,7363
18,I care about these issues because I have seen it first hand,7659,7718
19,I have seen what it does to communities,8072,8111
20,And so has she,8485,8499
21,She has that knowledge,8888,8910
22,When you have a generation of black men that are being incarcerated and are barely making it through school because they are going through the prison system first that is affecting the black families and that is in turn affecting the productivity of this country,9191,9453
23,That is something we need to address immediately,9725,9773
24,"I think she is the best to do it."" n n ? ""I am a first-generation American",10103,10177
25,I am a first-generation college student,10521,10560
26,I am the first person in my family to go to law school,10909,10963
27,Im particularly very interested in voting rights and campaign finance reform,11290,11366
28,These two issues have really framed both why I have wanted to go to law school and why I want to help people after,11660,11774
29,I believe law school is a place where I can impact a lot of change in these areas,12030,12111
30,I dont have to look a certain way to do it,12379,12421
31,I dont have to come from a certain background to do it,12729,12783
32,"I can really achieve my dreams.?"" ""When she acknowledged white privilege towards the end of the speech I was very surprised by that",13077,13208
33,I dont think people would expect something like that from a major presidential candidate,13527,13615
34,I was very satisfied to come out of that speech knowing thats where she was in terms of fully acknowledging both her privilege and white privilege,13915,14061
35,"And not just as something that might exist but something that we have to talk about in our society if we hope to make progress at achieving racial justice.?"" It demonstrated that this is not something she started caring about yesterday",14286,14521
36,This is something that she has been fighting for for years,14804,14862
37,Seeing her here in Harlem talking about white privilege really reiterated for me that this has been part of a decades-long commitment to fighting for racial justice,15209,15373
38,Specifically she speaks with the community and actually listens to find out what the issues are that we care about and hope our president will solve,15661,15809
39,I think that this speech in particular and that moment in acknowledging white privilege was the product of years of listening to the black community hearing our concerns and hopes for America and the visions that we have of a more equal society,16031,16275
40,For me I respect that a lot,16538,16565
41,It shows that she is not just a doer but also a listener,16893,16949
42,Well Ive always supported her but something I love about her which I just recently found out is that when she was very young she worked with Marian Wright Edelman founder of the Childrens Defense Fund,17202,17402
43,So I did some research and I found out that even as a fresh college graduate she was very much involved in doing things for children,17627,17759
44,"When she was just out of undergrad ""separate but equal"" had been outlawed but ""segregation academies"" were still around in the South",18032,18164
45,So in order to investigate these kinds of schools she went to the South and pretended to be a mother who was interested in enrolling her children in a school that didnt allow black children,18426,18615
46,I love that so much,18899,18918
47,That takes a lot of chutzpah to do especially at that age,19265,19322
48,And that shows you her mindset,19677,19707
49,Shes always been like this,20080,20106
50,Shes always wanted to help people,20482,20515
51,"""The inequity that we experience as black Americans especially when it comes to being arrested",20863,20957
52,Iowa has a really high rate of black young men incarcerated,21299,21358
53,We need to do something about that,21725,21759
54,I believe that Hillary will,22135,22162
55,And I believe that she has the right approach to fixing this because it is a complicated issue,22484,22578
56,You cant right this wrong in a year,22889,22924
57,It didnt take a year for this to happen and its going to take some time for us to straighten it out correctly,23214,23323
58,These are complex issues and I like that she is a person who sees all parts of the problem and tries to work on each one,23560,23680
59,"That means a lot to me."" ""So Ive never understood the impulse that makes some people want to be president",23937,24042
60,You couldnt pay me enough,24338,24363
61,It seems like such a thankless job,24694,24728
62,But with her I get it,25058,25079
63,I see her and I see that she wants to get in there and help as many people as humanly possible and she knows that as president she will,25354,25489
64,That selflessness to me it what makes her the most qualified especially when you put it on top of all of her experience,25736,25855
65,"Shes not only ready but she wants the job for the right reasons."" I have! I got to meet her about a week before the caucuses and it was amazing",26096,26239
66,When I met her I told her that she gave a speech that inspired me to run for school board in my district,26460,26564
67,"And she lit up! She squeezed my hand and she asked me ""How did it go?"" I told her ""I won!"" She said ""Im so proud of you thats incredible!"" This woman who is so accomplished and has done so much told me that shes proud of me",26743,26966
68,Thats insane,27210,27222
69,And it was genuine! I know its not the popular opinion—that shes a real person with feelings and emotions—but when I was talking to her I felt like we were the only people in that room,27501,27685
70,During that speech she talked about the importance of electing Democrats on every single level—city state federal all of it—and she was so passionate about democracy and politics really being local and being something that you have to involve yourself in,27882,28136
71,"And she used that John Wesley quote: ""Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can."" That really spoke to me",28352,28490
72,I had been considering doing something for a while and that was the push I needed,28739,28820
73,"""We have made so much progress as a nation recently",29144,29195
74,And its not abstract progress—its progress that helps everyday families in a very tangible way,29526,29620
75,But that progress is not secure,29968,29999
76,Its very tenuous and it could all be undone in an instant,30375,30432
77,I believe that Hillary can truly protect our progress,30797,30850
78,Not just because shes a strong smart woman—which she is obviously—but because after meeting her I know that shes the kind of person who can get things done,31160,31315
79,Shes so genuine—and she cares so much about people—that I know she will do everything she can to help everyone she can,31584,31702
80,"I believe in her."" ""Porter is my youngest—I also have a son whos 13",31988,32055
81,She is as my wife would say the most thoughtful caring and sweet little girl; but actually she absolutely has a streak of independence and decisiveness in her,32340,32498
82,"She loves superheroes over Barbies—she puts her Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in her backpack right along with her Barbies and the Ninja Turtles all live in her Barbie house."" ""I worry about children",32774,32972
83,I worry about mine of course—but I worry about all the other children who dont have the access or the opportunity that my children do,33230,33363
84,Fifty percent of the households in my community make less than $30000 a year,33654,33730
85,When I go into the high school and I offer the students an opportunity for employment at one of the major employers in Des Moines and they dont even know where that employers located that scares me,33994,34191
86,"If we dont open these doors theyll never even know that the doors exist for them to walk through."" ""Ive been in Des Moines for the last 16 years so I was here to witness what Iowa did for Barack Obama",34389,34589
87,And having a son who is a black male I can now look him in the eyes and tell him that honestly with hard work and dedication he can become president of the United States,34750,34919
88,And with Secretary Clinton when she wins I will be able to look my daughter in the eyes and tell her the same thing,35148,35263
89,"Thats why Im doing this—for her."" ""I was born and raised a Republican",35542,35611
90,I dont know that I ever put a lot of thought into it,35894,35946
91,In 2008 I lost my job,36253,36274
92,And I know that didnt happen because of George W,36583,36631
93,Bush,36949,36953
94,It wasnt a political issue it was just economics and I paid the price for it,37252,37328
95,I wasnt able to get another job for 19 months and in those 19 months I applied to 412 jobs,37589,37679
96,At that time I was a devoted Fox News follower and heres Steve King our great congressman from northwest Iowa and Jon Kyl who was a senator from Arizona telling people that the long-term unemployed were lazy and we were a drain on the economy,37891,38133
97,I knew that was a lie,38395,38416
98,I wasnt lazy,38805,38817
99,But those lawmakers didnt want to understand this issue,39184,39239
100,They wanted to cast doubt and divide people because that was politically expedient for them,39566,39657
101,And that was when I realized that the party I grew up with had left me,39966,40036
102,"So in 2008 I became a Democrat because from what I saw the Republican Party just completely walked away from their social responsibility—but Democrats were there and they were ready to actually help people."" Oh Ill never forget it",40293,40523
103,It was 2008 and she was at a town hall,40810,40848
104,"Someone asked her a very simple question: ""How do you do it?"" Before this my wife had always been an avid Hillary Clinton supporter and I was not",41121,41266
105,But her answer to that question which was very real and genuine—that got my attention,41553,41638
106,And I started looking at Hillary Clinton in a much different light,41966,42032
107,You could tell that this person had put everything she had into this race,42356,42429
108,And it was very meaningful to her,42772,42805
109,She was giving it everything she had,43169,43205
110,"She could have easily said ""Ive had enough",43550,43592
111,"I cant do this anymore."" But she didnt",43932,43970
112,She stuck it out,44312,44328
113,Which should have proved to anybody: This is a very tough human being,44666,44735
114,"""We met her at the Iowa fairgrounds",45060,45095
115,And it was awesome,45443,45461
116,The minute she hit the room the room changed,45809,45853
117,She had a big smile,46191,46210
118,She was happy to see everybody,46548,46578
119,She doesnt overtake the room she works right into the room,46908,46966
120,Her presence is with you,47294,47318
121,Not above you not at you but with you,47647,47684
122,It was a fantastic opportunity,48012,48042
123,And you know whats great? When you get to talk to her even for a minute she will stop and she will look you dead square in the eye and talk to you,48303,48449
124,There can be three five hundred people around you and that conversation is one-on-one,48714,48799
125,"Thats an amazing thing."" ""The injustice and inequalities that refugees have to deal with in our society",49138,49241
126,Ive worked very closely with refugees in the past,49595,49644
127,The refugee resettlement system has been around a very long time but it hasnt changed for the better in a while,49996,50107
128,I feel—and every refugee feels—grateful for the fact that weve received a second chance at life by getting to come here,50407,50526
129,But its kind of an assembly-line system where its in and out in and out,50826,50897
130,"I think when youre dealing with human life thats not fair."" And I want to add: Being a first-generation immigrant I feel like I deal with different kinds of biases and discriminations every day in many ways",51155,51361
131,I worry about my kids being able to integrate well in the community and that they will be accepted equally,51615,51721
132,"""I am a great supporter of President Obama and I feel like she is the only person who will continue the great work that he has started and build on his legacy",51969,52127
133,And Hillarys and my values are similar,52430,52468
134,"Being a diverse community member from a diverse background I feel like she understands me and people like me and shes supportive of our issues."" ""She sees injustice",52784,52948
135,She sees a system that she can help make better,53248,53295
136,I relate to that,53652,53668
137,I appreciate her fighting for us for the right things,54017,54070
138,Im from Nepal,54427,54440
139,Nepal is in a very dire situation right now and the U.S,54818,54873
140,government is not taking any stance on helping,55230,55276
141,I think someone like her—who is more aware about the different countries and has experience internationally—can really do something to help us,55618,55760
142,"Its very lofty thinking but Im hopeful."" ""Im opening a business this summer and I think about that pretty much 24/7",56074,56189
143,Its a big undertaking,56544,56565
144,Im 35 years old and my business partners and I are taking on a lot to do a 5300-square-foot restaurant,56893,56995
145,Any time you do something creative you wonder how people will react to it and you hope everyone will like it,57277,57385
146,The build-up was very fun but its all just on paper until it opens,57678,57744
147,And then its real,58088,58105
148,"I worry about how well do."" ""Yes: When Barack Obama chose Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state",58436,58534
149,She handled that so brilliantly,58879,58910
150,She worked harder than anybody I can remember in that position,59279,59341
151,She really truly was the ultimate ambassador for our country,59705,59765
152,"And the truth is that shes been fighting for our country for her whole career—but I dont think that has ever shined brighter than it did during her time as secretary of state."" ""Well obviously experience is very important in a presidential candidate",60028,60277
153,You have to have experience to be president,60558,60601
154,And she does,60981,60993
155,But for me thats just the baseline,61379,61413
156,A president also needs to inspire passion,61789,61830
157,And in my mind shes done that,62205,62234
158,Over the course of her career she has inspired such a vast group of people from all sorts of backgrounds,62544,62648
159,I believe that we should always dream big but we also need to exist within the political realities of our time and work to get things done where we can,62923,63074
160,And she does that too,63465,63486
161,"So for me its not just about experience and electability—its the total package."" ",63877,63957
