17,We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women,6767,6840
18,And last night he doubled down on his excuse saying that well its just locker room banter,7145,7234
19,You know whats happened today which is so interesting is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA from Major League Baseball from the NFL and more have been coming forward tweeting theyve been saying no thats not what happens in our locker rooms,7464,7716
20,"And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does."" ""But it wasnt just this one video that was so disturbing even shocking",7889,8096
21,We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign and its not just about women,8356,8451
22,Yes hes insulted and demeaned women; weve seen it over and over again,8801,8870
23,But he has targeted others as well,9269,9303
24,Hes disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos Muslims and POWs people with disabilities and immigrants,9674,9792

28,We are bigger than that,11210,11233
29,And I want to send a message to every boy and girl every man and woman in our country indeed to the entire world that that is not who America is,11495,11639
30,And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever,11886,11964
31,Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than weve had in a really long time,12260,12366
32,"And the main reason is because your generation the young people of America are the most tolerant open and generous generation in American history."" ""You know whats at stake but you also know what you believe",12641,12848
33,And you dont want someone who says that hes going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will – who will keep Citizens United one of the worst decisions ever made that allowed dark unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a womans right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood,12990,13357
34,You know better than that,13602,13627
35,You are helping us move toward a more perfect union,14011,14062
36,That has been the story of America at our best,14411,14457

39,"Weve got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity."" ""And please never forget America is great because America is good and if we deviate if we deviate from our fundamental values – and thats indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run",15463,15784
40,He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes,15973,16049
41,He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country – a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty,16327,16458
42,This is turning the clock back not just a few years but centuries,16743,16808
43,The only way to rebuke this is to vote,17143,17181
44,"Use the single most important fundamental right you have as citizens of America."" ""And when you do I want you to know what youre voting for because I dont want you just to vote against something",17443,17637

47,So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund,18622,18749
48,As soon as I got out of law school I said I dont want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families,18978,19107
49,So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change helping to get the law that enabled people kids with disabilities to go to school,19314,19484
50,Now most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you werent born but – there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability if you lived in a school district there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you,19645,19905
51,And literally millions of kids were denied an education,20137,20192
52,I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say this is wrong – in America were better than this,20458,20681
53,"Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities."" And then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place",20842,21052
54,"""So when Donald Trump talks about what Ive been doing for the last 30 years I welcome that",21269,21359
55,I welcome it because in the 1970s I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments,21632,21808
56,And in the 1980s I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business,22011,22263
57,And in the 1990s I went to the UN Conference on Women and said womens rights are human rights – while he was insulting Miss Universe Alicia Machado,22439,22586
58,And on the day – on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice,22819,22973
59,"So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years bring it on."" ""So weve got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want",23192,23345
60,And Im pretty clear about that,23593,23623
61,I think we want new jobs with rising incomes,23939,23983
62,And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II,24266,24345
63,And I have some specific ideas in mind,24655,24693
64,We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems,25000,25131
65,They need to be upgraded and maintained and built,25456,25505
66,That is a question of competitiveness,25869,25906
67,We have to have a competitive economy,26283,26320
68,Our airports are so rundown we dont even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because were not using the newest technology,26635,26786
69,"Were not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs."" ""I do want to bring advanced manufacturing",27017,27154
70,I heard Ted Strickland talking about that,27470,27511
71,I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance,27869,27916
72,There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing,28279,28334
73,Im not interested in a race to the bottom in competing for low-wage jobs,28698,28770
74,I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs,29129,29180
75,"So lets lead in precision machining 3D printing."" ""And lets be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century",29518,29628
76,Some nations going to have that title,29963,30000
77,I think its either going to be Germany or China or us,30346,30399
78,It should be us,30759,30774
79,No question it should be,31163,31187
80,Were going to fight climate change,31564,31598
81,"And were going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement."" ""Im running against somebody who doesnt believe in climate change or at least he says he doesnt  who has even said he thinks its a hoax created by the Chinese",31868,32114
82,Well right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do,32348,32419
83,So maybe they think its a hoax but theyre investing,32732,32783
84,And theyre creating,33135,33154
85,And theyre going to want to export,33511,33545
86,And what a shame it would be,33894,33922
87,We have innovated,34271,34288
88,We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this,34641,34715
89,"And were going to do it."" ""When I am president I want all of you who care about science technology engineering mathematics I want you to be part of it",34980,35130
90,And while we are growing the economy we are going to make it fairer,35393,35460
91,We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty,35766,35874
92,"And dont you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for womens work?"" ""You know back in the spring I was at a town hall in Las Vegas",36123,36264
93,And the little girl raised her hand,36533,36568
94,And I called on her,36904,36923
95,"And she said to me If youre elected president does a girl president make the same as a boy president?"" I said ""Well thats one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make."" So were going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly",37141,37439
96,"""And Ill tell you something else",37672,37704
97,I want to do more to promote profit-sharing,38068,38111
98,If you help to make the profits it shouldnt all just go to the executives and the shareholders,38439,38533
99,"You should be able to share in that."" ""Now theres a lot we can do",38821,38886
100,And people say Well how are you going to pay for it? Well Im going to go where the money is,39161,39252
101,And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country,39507,39566
102,I have made a pledge and you can hold me to it,39848,39894
103,I will not raise taxes on the middle class,40189,40231
104,"Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share."" ""Now Donald Trump is the poster child for this",40458,40669
105,Last night he finally admitted he hasnt paid a dime in federal income tax for years,40898,40981
106,Now he claims thats because back in the early 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos,41303,41407
107,Who loses money running casinos? Really,41745,41784
108,Now one of his supporters said Well the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didnt have to pay taxes made him a genius,42087,42222
109,Well I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year,42457,42532
110,But Ill tell you what,42822,42843
111,"What that meant was he paid zero zero for the military zero for our vets zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college."" ""And then he did something that in retrospect seemed both odd and not very smart",43082,43318
112,He brought in Warren Buffett,43583,43611
113,He said Well everybody does this,43978,44010
114,"Warren Buffett does this."" ""So Warren Buffett who by the way is a real billionaire Warren Buffett heard that pretty hard to miss",44334,44462
115,And so he put out a statement today,44776,44811
116,And heres what he said,45150,45172
117,He said I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944 when I was 13,45478,45552
118,He said I have copies of all 72 of my returns,45842,45887
119,And none uses a carryforward,46220,46248
120,That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share,46585,46647
121,And then Warren Buffett ends by saying Finally I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited,46955,47078
122,I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit,47397,47461
123,Neither would Mr,47829,47845
124,Trump,48249,48254
125,At least he would have no legal problem in doing so,48636,48687
126,"Well if you take a shot at Warren Buffett youd better be prepared."" ""And in fact Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more",48987,49144
127,He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him,49406,49520
128,"And he has proposed whats called the Buffett rule and I am absolutely behind that and Ive said thats one of the changes I want – so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share."" ""Now there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe",49713,49955
129,And so dont,50189,50200
130,But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer,50536,50601
131,You know hes not usually tongue-tied but he had no answer when confronted about the report that hes been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs,50878,51103
132,Now I know youve seen reports and youve probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies,51375,51475
133,Hes had a lot of them across Ohio,51803,51836
134,He claims to be on the side of workers,52172,52210
135,He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers,52529,52600
136,He even had the nerve – this is what kills me about him – he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring,52879,53025
137,And the whole time he was hiding the truth,53326,53368
138,"Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel."" ""You know when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price and people like Trump buy it that kills jobs",53676,53891
139,It kills jobs in this state including right here in Columbus,54207,54267
140,This May Columbus Castings the biggest single-site foundry in America just seven miles from where we are tonight filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off,54581,54763
141,Now when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people it really – it really gets me upset,55016,55129
142,Theres no justification for it,55428,55458
143,But it fits him to a T,55795,55817
144,For all his talk about putting America first hes made his products in at least 12 other countries,56131,56228
145,Trumps suits and ties were made in Mexico and China,56529,56580
146,They could have been made right here in Ohio,56902,56946
147,"In fact he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York."" ""So weve got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing",57196,57406
148,"And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country investment in workers investment in plant and equipment investment in research and development and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others."" ""We are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms",57501,57889
149,Were going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed the Dodd-Frank rules,58052,58160
150,Trump wants to do away with those,58509,58542
151,He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers,58875,59044
152,He wants to do away with that,59362,59391
153,"And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class."" ""Well were going to crack down on corporate fraud like weve seen at Wells Fargo",59692,59848
154,Were going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again,60108,60196
155,And were going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America,60477,60586
156,"If they try to leave were going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America."" ""Were also going to end the carried interest loophole",60795,61006
157,Ive been trying to get that done for years,61262,61304
158,Were going to get it done,61644,61669
159,Weve got a couple of different ways of doing it,61995,62042
160,I hope that Congress along with us but if they dont were going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate not for investing but just for moving money around,62231,62503
161,Thats going to end,62719,62737
162,I want to reward the productive economy,63107,63146
163,I dont want to keep rewarding the financial economy,63518,63569
164,"That is not the way were going to grow new businesses and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans."" ""Now people in Ohio often ask about Well what are we going to do about trade? Well were going to have smart and fair trade",63835,64070
165,Thats what I love about your Senator Sherrod Brown,64322,64372
166,He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have,64673,64747
167,Look,65072,65076
168,Weve got to trade with the rest of the world,65417,65461
169,Were only 5 percent of the population of the world,65777,65827
170,Weve got to trade with the other 95 percent,66159,66202
171,When I was Secretary of State we really bore down on this and we increased American exports 30 percent and in particular 50 percent to China because we stood behind every American business,66497,66685
172,"We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell."" ""And Ive gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade",66948,67093
173,They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal,67362,67517
174,So were going to stand up,67825,67850
175,"Im going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal were already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us."" ""And Ive always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership the TPP it fails my tests",68035,68444
176,Once it was finally negotiated I dont think it will do what I want it to do so I oppose it,68598,68688
177,I oppose TPP now,68991,69007
178,Ill oppose it after the election,69358,69390
179,Ill oppose it as president,69731,69757
180,"But Im going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world."" ""I also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security",70015,70251
181,And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about but Ill tell you what,70473,70584
182,I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security,70892,70949
183,"That is off the table forever."" ""So lets say yes to good jobs but heres what else we need to say yes to",71250,71353
184,Lets say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university,71643,71731
185,I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well,72031,72101
186,And for a lot of kids theyre not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade,72419,72506
187,Theres an achievement gap already,72855,72888
188,Theres also a digital gap; we have five million homes mostly poor homes without access to the internet so theyre behind,73226,73345

192,I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education,74817,74926
193,And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school,75219,75324
194,We need technical education for more young people,75656,75705
195,Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful,76000,76172
196,I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses,76430,76519
197,We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers for coders for all kinds of skills,76804,76908
198,"""And then when it comes to college I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself",77150,77335
199,We both remember that college was affordable,77616,77660
200,And it isnt for a lot of people now and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities,77996,78116
201,"So here is our proposal."" ""We want anyone from a family that makes less than $125000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free",78393,78528

203,So yes you pay what you can afford but you dont have to go into debt to go to Ohio State,79167,79255
204,And Ill tell you the other big problem – how many of you already have student debt? Oh wow,79519,79609
205,Practically every hand,79924,79946

212,So he saved the money for me to go to college,82474,82519
213,I had to work if I wanted to buy a book but that was okay,82800,82857
214,That was the arrangement,83142,83166
215,And then I told him I wanted to go to law school,83451,83499
216,He said Youre on your own,83782,83807
217,I dont have any money for that,84113,84143
218,So I worked I got a small scholarship and I took out loans,84450,84508
219,But boy was I lucky because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs,84787,84871
220,"In other words when I got out of law school I could go to work for the Childrens Defense Fund and make I dont know $14000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income not on an interest rate of 8 10 12 percent like I see from young people across America.""

223,You get the training and youre kind of on call and you practice and train,86295,86368
224,And then if youre needed youre called up,86681,86721
225,I want a civilian national reserve and I want people of all ages in it,87038,87108
226,And we would train you so that if theres a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with we could call you up to go do that,87355,87497
227,And its a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because thats how we build solidarity,87722,87845
228,"Thats how we get to know each other better."" ""So Im pretty excited about what were going to do together",88103,88206
