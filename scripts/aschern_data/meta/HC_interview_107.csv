0, Madam Secretary thank you for joining us,0,40
1,It was quite a night last night and I was taken with your moment of candor there before the cameras when you said you had a sigh of relief,395,533
2,Tell us about that sigh of relief and what it meant to you,858,916
3,""" Right",1232,1239
4,Oh Chris it meant the world to me,1577,1610
5,As we all remember I was not successful in Iowa last time and I know how hard that caucus process is,1907,2007
6,So proud of our organization our volunteers all my supporters,2313,2374
7,Everybody said if there were a big turnout that would advantage Senator Sanders,2712,2791
8,There was a big turnout and we won,3139,3173
9,"And now Im in New Hampshire looking forward to the primary next Tuesday and continuing to make my case in this contest of ideas between me and the senator.""  Well you know ""The New York Times"" ran this story this morning that you were disappointed and I think its possible to be both disappointed and relieved",3393,3701
10,You could have been disappointed at 9:00 but very relieved at 11:00,3925,3992
11,I mean the times change during the course as the results come in,4344,4408
12,"Are both those possible? You thought you could have done better with your field operation but youre also glad you came out ahead? "" Look Chris I really believe that during the last few weeks leading up to the caucus I could feel the energy building",4652,4900
13,Its a tough process and what I was seeing on the ground as people were telling me they were changing their minds that they were supporting me what my organizers were reporting was all consistent that it was going to be close but if we did our work and we did we would win,5017,5288
14,So I was thrilled by winning and getting that boost out of Iowa here in New Hampshire where I am in Senator Sanders backyard as you know as a political expert of your many years that New Hampshire votes for neighbors,5410,5626
15,"And so I have to really get out there make my case which I intend to do this week."" "" I just love the way you snuck that in",5824,5947
16,Its his backyard therefore he has an advantage geographically and we shouldnt put too much stock into it,6192,6296
17,But let me ask you about this because Im looking at these polls,6599,6662
18,Theres a range in the polling over the last couple weeks in New Hampshire and it is his back yard,6960,7057
19,Look at the map its Vermont and New Hampshire right next to each other twin there,7333,7414
20,"Between 6 and 33 points hes got a lead on you up there and I wonder how much ground you can make in a week because we only have a week now."" "" I feel really good about my campaign in New Hampshire and I remember getting off the plane in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses last time where I did not win and I was way behind going into what was then just five days before the primary",7529,7913
21,And the work that was done on my behalf the people who came out to support me the incredible excitement — I saw that today in Nashua,8014,8146
22,I got here it was amazing Chris,8446,8477
23,The level of enthusiasm people who were with me before people who were with President Obama in 08 everybody working so hard to support me to get to that primary to do everything we possibly can,8757,8950
24,Were not leaving anything on the ground,9240,9279
25,Were moving forward,9660,9679
26,"And I think well do well.""  I think everybody should have been impressed",10045,10116
27,Maybe I wasnt as impressed as I should have been but everybody should have been about the way you handled New Hampshire last time around,10424,10560
28,You came off the loss in Iowa,10875,10904
29,You went out there and you would stand there — it was like Bill Clinton staying there until the last dog died,11212,11321
30,You were out there on that arena I remember you standing in a I think it was a field house and you went on and on and on,11551,11671
31,It went on for five hours,11945,11970
32,It was incredible,12310,12327
33,It was a marathon answering every single question of everyone in that room,12652,12726
34,It really was a physical — a marathon,13035,13072
35,"Are you going to try to match that performance this time that kind of ""I can do this"" thing? "" Im going to do everything I can to get out there to meet with folks here to answer their questions",13320,13513
36,Im really happy weve got a forum on CNN tomorrow night,13758,13812
37,Weve got your MSNBC debate on Thursday night which will give us a chance to reach a larger audience,14118,14217
38,But Im going to be there day after day between now and Tuesday,14524,14586
39,I respect this primary process,14928,14958
40,I know how seriously people take it,15316,15351
41,And I just want them to understand what Im offering what I believe we can do,15677,15753
42,You know ideas that sound good on paper but cant create results for people are just that good ideas on paper,16048,16156
43,I have a track record of producing results,16452,16494
44,I know how to do all parts of this job,16814,16852
45,Because were going to be voting for both a president and a commander in chief,17179,17256
46,And in New Hampshire those two sides of this incredibly difficult job are really joined together,17567,17663
47,"And I feel good about the opportunity Ill have to get out meet with granite staters make my case and Im going to do everything possible to get them to support me next Tuesday."" "" I know youve been saying nice things about your only opponent now",17902,18146
48,Its really a battle since Martin OMalley Governor OMalley has withdrawn,18405,18476
49,Its a two-person race,18866,18887
50,The only person and Im going to say this bluntly — the only person between a confirmed socialist whos calling for political revolution in this country winning the nomination of the Democratic party which has always been more moderate than that is you,19194,19444
51,So when you saw that rally last night the young people all around Senator Sanders when he yelled revolution out there and they all applauded like mad do you think thats something that is going to help in a general election or are we looking at what we used to call in the 60s an NDC campaign — November doesnt count,19568,19883
52,We just want to win the party we dont care about the general,20067,20127
53,You seem to be focused on the general,20436,20473
54,How do you beat a person whos coming along in the primaries however whos saying Im going to give you all the things you want free tuition more social security benefits without an increase in your taxes healthcare from birth to death all government paid,20728,20980
55,"How do you compete with a revolution of promises really?"" "" Well first let me say I am thrilled too that weve got young people getting active in the campaign on the Democratic side",21187,21367
56,I was very proud of the many many young people working for me volunteering for me voting caucusing for me in Iowa and the ones I have here in New Hampshire Im just so impressed with,21577,21758
57,So thats a net good no matter what,22018,22052
58,I do think that we have an obligation to keep people focused on whats at stake in this election and you got close to saying it Chris,22329,22461
59,We cant let the Republicans rip away the progress weve made,22757,22816
60,We cant let them go back to trickle-down economics repeal the affordable care act we cant let them stack the supreme court for another generation against common sense kind of changes that we need,23111,23306
61,Weve got to get back to the middle weve got to get back to the big center weve got to get back to solving problems,23538,23652
62,Thats how we make progress in America,23941,23978
63,I am proud to be in a line of Democratic presidents who just got in there and fought it out who got civil rights who got an economy producing high incomes who got finally the affordable care act something weve been fighting for since Harry Truman,24224,24470
64,I know how hard this is and I totally appreciate how exciting it can be to be involved in a campaign that really just puts out these great big ideas,24674,24822
65,But I want folks to stop and think no matter what age you are OK we agree on getting the economy going,25059,25161
66,We agree on raising incomes we agree on combating climate change we agree on universal coverage,25452,25547
67,Who has the track record? Whos gotten the results? Who can actually produce the kind of change you want for yourself and your family and for our country? So Im very energized about this because I like a contest of ideas,25807,26026
68,Thats what politics should be about,26304,26339
69,Were going to be talking about and arguing about issues on our side theyre going to keep insulting each other on the Republican side but the goal for any sensible American has to be do not turn the white house over to the Republicans in November,26597,26842
70,Do not turn the supreme court further over to their nominees,27087,27147
71,"We cant let that happen."" "" Well of course I think youre offering a lesson in civics and I wonder if we can do that in a couple weeks now",27417,27554
72,Look the history of the Democratic party your party not Bernie Sanders hes not a Democratic party member — your party has produced The New Deal,27787,27930
73,It produced the progressive income tax came from the Democrats from Wilson,28257,28331
74,Social security the greatest anti-poverty program ever came from Roosevelt,28700,28774
75,And Harry Truman started to fight for health care and civil rights and all these good things that led to the affordable care act,29103,29231
76,But in every case you had to battle Republicans who voted against it to the last person,29520,29607
77,And its always been a tough fight,29914,29947
78,You need 60 votes in the senate you need what is it 218 in the house and if you dont have it nothing gets done,30229,30339
79,The Bernie people need to be taught not him he wont be taught — the kids behind him need to be told this is how it works in our system,30551,30685
80,You can call for revolution but it aint going to happen,30942,30997
81,There isnt going to be a revolution,31322,31357
82,Theres going to be an election an inauguration and then theres going to be a congress sitting with you youve got to do business with no matter who gets elected,31647,31806
83,"You dont have to worry about logic anymore just Im going to have a revolution and pay for everything."" "" Well where I come out on this is I dont think our country or the American people can wait",32014,32208
84,I dont think they can wait for better jobs with rising incomes getting prescription drug costs down,32455,32554
85,I think people want to vote for somebody who is going to get in there on the first day knows how to do the job is prepared to do the job and gets to work,32800,32953
86,And I will give everything Ive got to make sure that we preserve the progress weve made because youre right it is hard fought,33168,33293
87,Our system is set up to make it difficult,33588,33629
88,Checks and balances separation of powers — our founders knew that if we were going to survive as a great democracy that they were creating we had to have a system that kept the passions at bay,33902,34094
89,We had to have people who were willing to roll up their sleeves and compromise,34351,34429
90,We couldnt have idealogues who were just hurling their rhetoric back and forth,34772,34850
91,We had to actually produce results,35225,35259
92,That hasnt changed since George Washington,35647,35689
93,Weve got to produce results now because a democracy is a fragile organism Chris,36062,36141
94,People have to believe they have a stake in it that their voices count that their votes count,36468,36561
95,But then theyve got to see results from their investment in our democracy,36886,36959
96,Our democracy has to work better our economy has to work better our politics has to work better,37263,37358
97,"Thats what I know how to do and thats what we have to get done in this election."" "" Madame secretary unofficially not on behalf of MSNBC or NBC congratulations on last night and your much deserved relief and break a leg on Thursday night even if youre the only one in the chair",37550,37827
98,"Thank you for joining us today."" "" Im going to be there.""  You said it I believe you",38128,38211
99,Thank you,38594,38603
100,""" Ill be there",38986,39000
101,"Bye-bye.""  Thank you",39383,39402
