28,And part of the challenge is youve got to intervene early,11173,11230
29,We need comprehensive health screenings,11574,11613
30,Then we need to figure out how do we get the right nutrition and vitamins,11967,12040
31,Youve got to begin to work to counteract the lead,12376,12425
32,Then weve got to get the educational additional help that kids need,12770,12837

42,"But do you also think its a failing by the EPA?"" "" Well I think it has to be absolutely investigated to figure out what happened",16502,16630
43,Why wasnt this sounding alarms everywhere? And I dont want to prejudge it,16912,16985
44,I dont know what the answer to that question is,17306,17353
45,Im focused on OK what do we do now? The damage has been done,17702,17762
46,How do we mitigate that damage? How do we help alleviate both intellectual and the physical lasting consequences that children face when theyve been poisoned by lead? So Im trying to look at the future,18035,18236
47,I know there will be a lot of people focusing on what happened and thats really important because we do have to you know open this inquiry more broadly,18481,18632
48,You know Ive said that weve got places in our country where we have asthma rates at 500 times higher killing you know young children of color than anybody else because of where they live and what theyre exposed to,18849,19062

58,Im just going to work as hard as I can,22621,22659
59,I love the New Hampshire primary,22980,23012
60,I love it because the interactions you have with voters in every setting is so rewarding and voters in this state take a first second third fourth look at you,23299,23457
61,Theyre constantly evaluating,23780,23808
62,I have been telling voters across the state this is the biggest job interview in the world,24165,24255
63,Youve got to really think hard about what the job is who can be president who can be commander in chief and then you have to really judge us,24529,24669
64,And I dont know whats going to happen,24941,24978
65,I know Im behind,25298,25314
66,"I am in very good spirits about that because I love the process.""  So you said the other night at the — I forget if it was the debate or the town hall they all run together in my mind but you said one of them that nobody can point to an example where you took money from a group..",25507,25786
67, Right,25997,26002
68, ..,26391,26393
69,and changed your vote,26779,26800
70,The Sanders campaign afterwards sent out an excerpt from a book from Elizabeth Warren in which she suggests that you took $140000.00 from the banking interests and as a result according to Warren not me changed your vote on the bankruptcy bill,27085,27328
71, Right,27604,27609
72,Right,28008,28013
73,""" Now I want — I would love it if you would address the substance of the allegation",28365,28448
74,"And also the fact that Sanders campaign sent it out but Sanders himself backed off from making the charge himself."" "" Well",28735,28857
75,thats their — thats their typical you know artistic smear,29179,29236
76,You know the campaign sends out something gets people riled up and then they say oh no were running a positive campaign,29558,29677
77,Enough,30017,30023
78,OK Im glad you raised this because I really do want to get this record straight once and for all,30355,30451
79,I worked with Senator Warren with whom I have the highest regard in 2000 to stop a very bad bankruptcy bill,30723,30830
80,And then when I got to the Senate in 2001 early on there was going to be a vote on another bankruptcy bill,31088,31194
81,I was deluged — now as a senator not as a first lady lobbying and working against this bill I was deluged by womens groups and childrens groups because the version of the bill that was going to be voted on did not protect child support did not protect vulnerable women and their children from what would happen to them if their partner their spouse went into bankruptcy and was able to discharge those obligations,31322,31735
82,And you know literally people I had worked with for 30 years came and said nobody else will do this,31906,32005
83,Youve got to help us,32331,32351
84,Weve got to change that provision,32709,32742
85,I took that on,33096,33110
86,And I went to the floor,33456,33479
87,And I buttonholed the Democrats and the Republicans who were leading that bill,33797,33875
88,I said you cant do this,34195,34218
89,Youve got to change that provision,34556,34590
90,And they did,34941,34953
91,But they also put it to me,35299,35325
92,They said if we change this provision you have to vote for the bill,35640,35707
93,Now thats what happens sometimes,36023,36055
94,I didnt like the bill any more than I had liked it before,36374,36431
95,It still had very bad provision,36738,36769
96,But I also pushed hard for a deal to protect women and children,37071,37134
97,So OK I held my nose,37443,37463
98,I voted for it,37790,37804
99,It never became law,38139,38158
100,When it came back in 2005 I was against it,38482,38524
101,I didnt actually get to vote against it because Bill was in the hospital with another heart procedure but I put out a statement on the floor,38786,38926
102,You can look at what I said in 2001,39187,39222
103,You can look at what I said in 2005,39545,39580
104,And so Im glad to set this record straight,39910,39952
105,You know but this kind of attack by innuendo insinuation is really getting old,40255,40333
106,You know hey cant point to anything,40660,40695
107,They are grabbing at straws to make this case,41057,41102
108,But lets ask Senator Sanders campaign why did he vote to deregulate swaps and derivatives? One of the key reasons for the Lehman brothers being over leveraged collapsing and helping to bring down the economy,41403,41610
109,You know this is a debate that we should be having about what our public records are and where we stand,41871,41974
110,I have the toughest most effective campaign plan to take on the entire financial industry,42286,42375
111,I dont understand why he doesnt join me,42719,42758
112,Because it goes a lot further than anything he is proposing,43106,43165
113,We have to look at the shadow banking industry,43518,43564
114,Everybody knows where I stand on this,43923,43960
115,"So I think we should end with the smear and the insinuation and talk about our respective plans."" "" A lot of your supporters were very upset this last week when some older male pundits suggested that you are a shouter",44233,44450
116,Now I would observe — I would observe that Bernie Sanders doesnt exactly talk in a whisper,44700,44790
117,"But that said do you think that — do you think that the coverage of you is sexist? Do you think that when male pundits say things like that they have a different standard for you?"" "" And I dont want to single anybody out Jake",45010,45235
118,Look we are still living with a double standard and I know it,45462,45523
119,Every woman I know knows it,45848,45875
120,Whether youre in the media as a woman or youre in the professions or business or politics,46184,46273
121,And I dont know anything other to do than to just keep forging through it and just taking the slings and arrows that come with being a woman in the arena,46530,46683
122,You know sometimes I talk soft,46968,46998
123,Sometimes I get passionate and I get a little bit excited,47321,47378
124,I dont know any man who doesnt do the same thing,47693,47741
125,And I find it sort of interesting that all of a sudden this is a big discussion about me once again,48022,48121
126,Im so used to this,48412,48430
127,Im going to keep making my case,48763,48794
128,Im going to keep talking about what I will do as president,49119,49177
129,Im going to keep laying out my record,49495,49532
130,"Because I think its really important that this election be actually about who can do the job that needs to be done starting in January of 2017.""  Last question madam secretary",49821,49995
131,"How has this experience of running for president changed you if it has? "" You know I think the most amazing learning experience",50261,50388
132,And having gone through this now twice I think I am a different person than I was back in 08,50670,50762
133,I think that the experience I had as secretary of state has given me a perspective and an understanding of a lot of the issues that is deep and gives me the confidence to know that I can do every part of the job,50962,51173
134,But you run at different points in a countrys you know thinking,51398,51461
135,And right now were at a time when people are on both sides Republicans Democrats right left people are really worried that our economy isnt working for them that our government isnt working for them,51734,51932
136,And thats causing a lot of the anger and the frustration,52213,52269
137,I totally get that,52664,52682
138,I feel it,53090,53099
139,You know things have been going on that are just wrong,53484,53538
140,These Supreme Court decisions against voting rights Citizens United — those are dramatically altering the balance of power in our country,53868,54005
141,The great recession for which there were a number of causes but you have to look at the failure of the Bush administration to regulate what was going on in the financial and mortgage markets,54282,54472
142,People deserve to be upset,54764,54790
143,But what Im saying — and maybe its not the most popular theme these days,55124,55196
144,You know get angry vent but then realize anger is not a plan and venting is not a strategy and we have work to do,55470,55583
145,And Im confident we can do that work,55851,55887
146,But were going to have to roll up our sleeves and say OK weve got to make sure the economy works for everybody not just those at the top,56144,56280
147,Heres my plan for jobs and raising incomes,56552,56594
148,Weve got to make sure the Affordable Care Act gets the cost down but gets coverage to 100 percent,56904,57001
149,Heres what I can do about that,57320,57350
150,Lets have a discussion about what you would be thinking if you were conducting a job interview,57676,57770
151,OK Ive got the experience Ive got the passion,58088,58133
152,And heres what Im going to do with it,58468,58505
153,And thats what I think the country needs because people are just whipping them up,58835,58916
154,I mean on the Republican side all of this rhetoric this demagoguery which plays to the fears and the insecurities that people feel,59211,59341
155,And I just think thats not who we are,59668,59705
156,We are the premier problem-solvers of human history,60062,60113
157,"Weve got to get back to doing that together."" "" All right Madam Secretary",60453,60526
158,Well see you on the campaign trail,60930,60964
159,"Good luck on Tuesday."" "" Ill be there",61368,61405
