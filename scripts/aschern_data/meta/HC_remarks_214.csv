26,Indeed at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region America needs an Israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace,11314,11577
27,"""Thats why I believe we must take our alliance to the next level",11818,11882

52,"Some things arent negotiable and anyone who doesnt understand that has no business being our president."" ""The second choice we face is whether we will have the strength and commitment to confront the adversaries that threaten us especially Iran",22830,23074
53,For many years weve all been rightly focused on the existential danger of Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon,23355,23460

63,This is a serious danger and it demands a serious response,27830,27888

67,If the Arab League can designate all of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization surely it is time for our friends in Europe and the rest of the international community to do so as well and to do that now,29562,29763
68,At the same time America should always stand with those voices inside Iran calling for more openness,30018,30118

76,This is a threat that knows no borders,33343,33381
77,Thats why Ive laid out a plan to take the fight to ISIS from the air on the ground with local forces and online where they recruit and inspire,33663,33805
78,"Our goal cannot be to contain ISIS; we must defeat ISIS."" ""And here is a third choice will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israels long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state."" It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists but inaction cannot be an option",33859,34414
79,Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people,34542,34598

82,Israelis and Palestinians could contribute to our greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs,35918,36012
83,I know how hard all of this is,36422,36452
84,I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face peace talks in 2010 that I presided over but Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace,36749,36986
85,That will only make it harder later,37280,37315
86,All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust,37674,37812
87,Like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority,38143,38374
88,But at the same time all of us must condemn actions that setback the cause of peace,38719,38802
89,Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated and children should not be taught to hate in schools,39150,39253
90,That poisons the future,39629,39652
91,Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions including with respect to settlements,40047,40143
92,Now America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts and as president I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations,40465,40603
93,And let me be clear I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution including by the U.N,40911,41029
94,Security Council,41371,41387
95,There is one more choice that we face together and in some ways it may be the most important of all will we as Americans and as Israelis stay true to the shared democratic values that have always been at the heart of our relationship? We are both nations built by immigrants and exiles seeking to live and worship in freedom nations built on principles of equality tolerance and pluralism,41589,41977
96,"""At our best both Israel and America are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values",42161,42258
97,This is the real foundation of our alliance and I think its why so many Americans feel such a deep emotional connection with Israel,42550,42681
98,"I know that I do and its why we cannot be neutral about Israel and Israels future because in Israels story we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and self-determination."" ""Theres so many examples",42901,43125
99,You know we look at the pride parade in Tel Aviv one of the biggest and most prominent in the world and we marvel that such a bastion of liberty exists in a region so plagued by intolerance,43314,43503
100,"We see the vigorous even raucous debate in Israeli politics and feel right at home."" ""And of course some of us remember a woman Golda Meir leading Israels government decades ago and wonder whats taking us so long here in America."" ""But we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished",43670,43967
101,Every generation has to renew our values and yes even fight for them,44222,44290
102,Today Americans and Israelis face currents of intolerance and extremism that threaten the moral foundations of our societies,44651,44775
103,"Now in a democracy were going to have differences but what Americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely encouraging violence playing coy with white supremacists calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States."" ""Now weve had dark chapters in our history before we remember the nearly 1000 Jews aboard the St",44940,45419
104,Louis who were refused entry in 1939 and sent back to Europe but America should be better than this and I believe its our responsibility as citizens to say so,45532,45690
105,If you see bigotry oppose it,45970,45998
106,If you see violence condemn it,46360,46390
107,"If you see a bully stand up to him."" ""On Wednesday evening Jews around the world will celebrate the Festival of Purim and children will learn the story of Esther who refused to stay silent in the face of evil",46655,46863
108,"It wasnt easy she had a good life and by speaking out she risked everything but as Mordecai reminded her we all have an obligation to do our part when danger gathers and those of us with power or influence have a special responsibility to do whats right."" As Elie Wiesel said when accepting the Nobel Peace Prize ""Neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim",46967,47328
109,"Silence encourages the tormentor never the tormented."" So my friends let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry",47534,47659
110,Together lets defend the shared values that already make America and Israel great,47999,48080
111,Let us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of Americans and Israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger,48368,48559
112,We are stronger together and if we face the future side by side I know for both Israel and America our best days are still ahead,48919,49047
113,Thank you so much,49455,49472
