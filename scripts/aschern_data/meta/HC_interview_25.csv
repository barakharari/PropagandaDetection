0, Secretary Clinton thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa,0,70
1, Thank you Alisyn,453,469
2, We are in Ames Iowa --  Yes,852,878
3,—where the temperature as we speak is one degree,1261,1309
4, Uh-hm,1692,1697
5,""" And I know that you have been going to countless campaign events here and Im wondering when you get up in the morning in Iowa if there are ever times you question your life choices?"" "" Absolutely no",1999,2199
6,You know I grew up in Chicago,2465,2494
7,Im used to cold weather,2852,2875
8,It doesnt bother me,3231,3250
9,In fact Im somewhat reassured that there is a real winter that we are actually seeing snow and lower temperatures,3573,3686
10,"But I get up every day whether Im in Iowa in New Hampshire wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people hear their stories give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very you know reinvigorating all the time.""  So lets talk about the tightening race between you and Bernie Sanders",3808,4214
11,Bernie Sanders is speaking to reporters on Monday night here in Iowa,4389,4457
12,"And he said that your campaign is in quote ""serious trouble."" Is that how you feel? "" Not at all",4759,4855
13,In fact I have always known that if you are going to run to be president particularly in the Democratic Party its a long hard challenging road,5115,5257
14,And so Ive been in these elections before,5544,5585
15,They always tighten up as people begin to make up their minds as they look at the candidates totally predictable,5920,6032
16,I feel really really good about the campaign organization that I have,6353,6422
17,A caucus is different from a primary,6774,6810
18,It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate but Im asking Iowans if theyll stand up for me on caucus night,7062,7275
19,"I will be standing up for them all through my presidency."" "" There is a new Quinnipiac poll out just about one hour ago in which Bernie Sanders is now beating you in Iowa",7448,7618
20,It is 49 percent to 44 percent,7887,7917
21,It is the first time that this has happened that hes been beating you in Iowa since September,8221,8314
22,We are 20 days out,8626,8644
23,"Does he have more momentum than you?"" "" Well the funny thing Alisyn is after that poll came out about an hour later there was a PPP poll where I was leading him by the same margin about six points up",8900,9099
24,I dont pay any attention to this,9344,9376
25,I dont feel that its a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night,9699,9786
26,I can only tell you that the energy the enthusiasm the excitement of my volunteers my organizers the voters who come who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building,10052,10223
27,Thats my experience,10516,10535
28,So Ill let people poll and try to figure out who is going to show up,10874,10942
29,"Im looking at people who are showing up making up their minds and trying to you know convince them to come out and caucus for me."" "" Why dont you feel that the polls are good reflection of whats going to happen in the caucus?"" "" Because they are so unpredictable",11136,11398
30,And its gotten increasingly difficult to poll,11645,11690
31,And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus,12027,12107
32,So thats been my experience,12439,12466
33,Ive watched this a long time,12825,12853
34,Ive had a prior election where I campaigned in Iowa,13185,13236
35,So I just put that aside,13564,13588
36,Ill let pundits and others worry about whos up and whos down,13916,13976
37,I just get up every day like we were saying going out there making my case drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents but there are real differences,14232,14413
38,And we need a spirited debate,14703,14732
39,Because after the first of the year a lot more people start paying attention,15076,15152
40,"And now I know its you know the make or break time people make up their minds.""  Bernie Sanders is also winning in New Hampshire",15445,15572
41,Not surprising,15896,15910
42,He is from a neighboring state,16274,16304
43,"Have you considered what would happen if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire what your plan is? "" I dont think about that",16609,16728
44,Im going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary,16985,17093
45,But this is a national campaign,17400,17431
46,Weve been organizing in South Carolina in Nevada a lot of the March 1st states the March 15th states,17751,17851
47,Remember I campaigned all the way into June last time,18182,18235
48,And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the you know changes in peoples concerns going into this election that we wouldnt know exactly how the outcome would be for you know a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses,18509,18754
49,So Im going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me,18988,19067
50,"And even though as you say Senator Sanders as a neighbor and a neighbor never lost in New Hampshire Im going to take that challenge on and do the best I can to get people in New Hampshire to support me as well.""  Vice President Joe Biden offered his thoughts to CNN on why he thinks Bernie Sanders is resonating",19240,19550
51,He said that he thinks its about Senator Sanders positions on income inequality,19749,19828
52,"And the Vice President said quote ""Its relatively new for Hillary to talk about that",20196,20280
53,Thats been Bernies,20666,20684
54,"No one questions Bernies authenticity on those issues."" Whats your reaction? "" Well the Vice President who I deeply respect and regard as a friend went on to say as I recall",21005,21178
55,But you know Hillary Clinton has a lot of very good economic policies that are thoughtful and on and on,21424,21527
56,Look I have been working toward closing the gaps between people poor people and well-off people primarily all my adult life,21806,21929
57,I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund,22269,22314
58,I helped to reform the education system in Arkansas,22661,22712
59,I was a legal services lawyer defending poor people,23075,23126
60,"I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husbands administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured."" ""I have been on this issue in many different ways",23393,23613
61,How do we make education more equal? How do we make health care more equal? Of course thats tied to income equality but there is also a broader range of issues that I have a long record of addressing,23789,23988
62,And when I was in the Senate I took on corporate executive pay,24231,24293
63,A lot of the abuses that I thought were there,24628,24673
64,I took on these derivatives and credit default swaps that contributed to the collapse of the economy and the great recession,24981,25105
65,I stood up to Wall Street,25421,25446
66,I called them out,25802,25819
67,So I have a very long record,26178,26206
68,I have a broader agenda,26565,26588
69,"Its not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and thats what I tried to do."" "" And since you have been devoting much of your career to talking about this why do you think the Vice President would say its more in Bernies wheelhouse and its about his authenticity?"" "" Oh I dont know",26771,27174
70,But you know I have a lot of regard for the vice president,27334,27392
71,And I think today he clarified what he said and said he was talking about me when I was Secretary of State,27676,27782
72,Well when I was Secretary of State I couldnt talk about domestic policy,28075,28146
73,There is an unwritten rule you do not meddle in domestic policy when you are secretary of state or for that matter secretary of defense,28444,28579
74,So yes for four years despite a long career both in and out of public service where I have been relentless in talking about these issues there were four years when I did not,28819,28992
75,I talked about how we were going to get Iran to the negotiating table and try to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon how were going to you know deal with a rising China what were going to do about womens rights something that goes to the heart of inequality,29156,29420
76,"So I had a different agenda because I had a different job."" "" So you didnt take Bidens comments as a slight?""  No",29618,29730
77,Not at all,30052,30062
78, OK,30449,30451
79,You are introducing your tax plan,30818,30851
80,One of the headlines is that you would impose a four percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million,31173,31270
81,And I believe that that would raise about $150 billion over ten years,31584,31653
82,"Does that go far enough in addressing income inequality? "" Well weve got a variety of proposals",31989,32084
83,Not only the four percent surcharge which I call the fair share surcharge,32423,32496
84,The so-called Buffet Rule which would have a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million limiting deductions to 28 percent with a charitable exception,32821,32983
85,Going after a lot of the subsidies that for example still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future,33235,33412
86,"So I have put forth plans paid family leave tuition debt-free tuition for public colleges."" ""Capping prescription drug costs and much more",33690,33828
87,And it would cost about $100 billion a year all of which I pay for,34141,34207
88,In contrast Senator Sanders has some very big ideas but he hasnt yet told anybody how he would pay for them,34513,34620
89,And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st,34891,34986
90,Well if you wait too long nobody will have a chance to see them or analyze them,35257,35336
91,"And so I am very clear about what I would do and how I would pay for it.""  Another point of conflict between you and Senator Sanders is on gun policy",35583,35731
92, Uh-hm,36028,36033
93, We just watched this very emotional event this morning,36394,36448
94, Yes,36814,36817
95, That you were involved in where this mom who lost two children --  Right -- —to gun violence got up and spoke,37157,37265
96,And it was really heartbreaking to hear her,37573,37616
97,It sounds like she lost her children to criminals,37952,38001
98, Yes,38370,38373
99," So how would you stop that? "" This is a very big difference in this campaign",38725,38801
100,Because as you saw I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members,39062,39251
101,It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence,39488,39635
102,And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now,39922,39998
103,We lose on an average 90 people a day,40350,40387
104,It has to stop Alisyn,40793,40814
105,"Ive been in this campaign advocating for comprehensive background checks closing the gun show loophole closing the online loophole closing whats called the Charleston loophole."" ""You know there was a loophole my opponent voted for it Senator Sanders that at the end of three days business days you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not",41074,41439
106,The killer in Charleston who bought that gun if there had just been a little more time it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record,41581,41773
107,We have saved a lot of lives,42019,42047
108,I cant put an exact number on it,42398,42430
109,"But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times more than two million people the Brady campaign says 2.4 million purchasers have been stopped from buying guns."" ""So we are talking about violent criminals",42707,42939
110,We are talking about domestic abusers,43262,43299
111,We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill,43694,43743
112,We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans wont close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns,44089,44220
113,I feel passionately about this,44562,44592
114,"And the cumulation from Sandy Hook to the community college in Oregon the fact that we have so many mass killings in the last few years I think it certainly motivated the President and I am so proud to support him and I want to make this a voting issue in this campaign.""   "" I want to talk about an issue Donald Trump wanted to make an issue in this campaign that is—are allegations from your husbands past",44772,45177
115,He is going further actually than that,45345,45383
116,He is making it about you,45745,45770
117,"He is saying that you are an enabler of bad behavior and of sexual assault."" ""Whats your response to Donald Trump?"" "" I have no response",46080,46216
118,Im going to let him say whatever he wants to say,46496,46544
119,He can run his campaign however he wishes,46892,46933
120,"Im going to keep talking about what the next president will have to do starting January 20th 2017."" ""I have deep disagreements with what hes proposing",47234,47384
121,His tax plans would cut trillions of dollars of taxes from the wealthy and corporations,47697,47784
122,He doesnt believe in equal pay,48150,48180
123,"He thinks that American workers are already making too much."" ""So Im going to draw the contrast with him that I think the American people are interested in seeing."" "" But when someone accuses you of being an enabler of sexual assault dont you need to respond to it? I mean particularly since this is an issue you wanted to talk about on the campaign trail",48394,48749
124,"Cant this sexual assault—you say survivors need to be believed and they need to be heard."" ""So when hes accusing you of doing something that is the antithesis of what you want to talk about dont you need to address it?"" "" Im going to let the American voters decide whats relevant and whats not relevant in their decision as to who theyre going to support.""  I have a few more questions",48785,49169
125,"Donald Trump was on ""The Tonight Show"" and asked about the possibility of you two running against each other if thats how this all plays out in November",49304,49456
126,"He said that would be quote ""an amazing thing.""    Yes it would be amazing",49738,49809
127,I would look forward to it,50164,50190
128,"""Look I think this is serious business",50567,50605
129,Campaigns always have some great stories and great characters,50976,51037
130,Thats part of the political process,51405,51440
131,This is really serious business who the next president is,51799,51856
132,We are either going to build on the progress that weve made or were going to see it ripped away,52190,52285
133,"We are either going to defend human rights and civil rights and womens rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers rights and all the rest that is at stake or we are going to turn the clock back."" ""And thats why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high",52455,52779
134,And if Im fortunate enough to get the nomination I will run hard against whomever the Republicans nominee because they represent a brand of politics and policies that I think would hurt our country,52910,53107
135,"I dont want to see that happen."" "" Lets say you get the nomination",53387,53453
136,"Lets say you win the presidency."" "" Yes lets say that."" "" Lets say it."" ""And on day one you walk into the Oval Office whats the first phone call you make?"" "" Well I think the very first phone call would be to whoever Ive asked to be the chief of staff of the White House",53647,53917
137,Lets get a meeting together lets get our agenda together,54119,54175
138,Theres a lot we have to get going,54497,54530
139,"The earlier we start the better well be off and well get more accomplished."" ""Because I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination right then and there how we organize the White House how we organize the cabinet",54782,55003
140,"Whats the legislative agenda?"" ""You know the time between an election and inauguration is short",55269,55364
141,You cant wait,55722,55735
142,I mean you cant take anything for granted,56113,56154
143,You have to keep working as hard as you possibly can but I think its important to start planning because we know what happens if you get behind in getting your agenda out and getting your appointments made,56428,56633
144,You lose time,56926,56939
145,"And youre not doing the work that the American people elected you to do.""  Before I let you go I definitely want to ask you about your granddaughter",57261,57408
146,You talk about her on the campaign trail,57716,57756
147,Today is I believe or recently Chelsea is making her first appearance on the campaign trail,58102,58193
148, Yes,58550,58553
149, She said she believes that you becoming a grandmother is a driving force behind your campaign,58916,59009
150,"How so? "" Well shes right because I feel very fortunate",59339,59394
151,I like to point out Im the granddaughter of a factory worker who came to this country as a young immigrant,59714,59820
152,"Went to work in the lace mills in Scranton Pennsylvania."" ""So here I am three generations later asking people to vote for me to become their president",60099,60249
153,And we have this amazing 15-month-old grandchild with another on the way next summer,60546,60630
154,"And so I think a lot about the future but I think not just about her future because were going to do everything we can to make sure she has the best opportunities life can offer but I think about what kind of country shell become an adult in and what kind of world is going to be waiting for her."" ""I want to make sure—its not just our grandchild but every child who has the opportunity to go as far to fulfill their God-given potential as possible",60744,61192
155,And a lot of that depends on the kinds of decisions that our presidents make,61313,61389
156,"Its not you know you have to have family support you have to have community support."" I wrote a book called ""It Takes A Village."" I understand that",61675,61822
157,Do you kids have health care? Thats why I created the childrens health care insurance program because too many didnt,62099,62215
158,Your kids have good education thats why Im for early childhood because too many kids come to school unprepared,62542,62652
159,How about college affordability? Too many kids are weeded out because they cant afford to start or stay,62981,63084
160,I go through the list of what is really dampening the opportunities that young people in our country have right now,63394,63509
161,And I want to be the president who unleashes that potential again,63830,63895
162,""" And when you think about your grandchildrens future are you worried or hopeful?"" "" Im always hopeful Alisyn",64231,64340
163,Im always hopeful,64707,64724
164,"I think this is the greatest country."" ""When I listen to the negative comments made about our country on the campaign stage predominantly by the Republicans I mean look at what weve come back from",65047,65243
165,It was a Republican administration under which we had the Great Recession,65548,65621
166,"That is just a fact."" ""President Obama inherited an economy that was losing 800000 jobs a month",65954,66049
167,I dont think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out and getting us standing again,66365,66457
168,"So I know that choices really matter in politics but I am absolutely committed to the belief the conviction that I have that our country is resilient were strong were smart."" ""Given the right leadership we can do anything",66706,66927
169,"Thats why I actually am quite optimistic and confident about the future.""  Secretary Clinton thank you so much",67286,67395
170, Thank you Alisyn,67817,67833
171, Great to talk to you,68255,68275
172,""" Its great to see you."" ",68697,68721
