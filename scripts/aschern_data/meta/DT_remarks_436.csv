0,"""Thank you",0,10
1,"Its great to be here today."" In particular I want to thank Mr",423,484
2,Ron Packard and Ms,897,915
3,Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school,1328,1371
4,Today we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice,1784,1878
5,But before we do I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clintons emails,2221,2309
6,"According to the FBI report: ""The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact and in doing so obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account."" Remember Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program – among many other extremely sensitive matters",2544,2917
7,This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief,3151,3231
8,By the way the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism and made us less safe than ever before,3475,3765
9,Throughout it all she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State,3992,4113
10,These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia doing favors for UBS bank and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti,4412,4550
11,"""Its all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation."" ""As part of her criminal cover-up Hillary Clintons staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena",4851,5052
12,"Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer."" Then when she was interviewed by the FBI she claimed she couldnt remember important events 39 times",5335,5507
13,She couldnt even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information,5824,5908
14,"She even said she didnt know that the letter ""C"" stood for confidential classified information",6289,6383
15,"""All the while as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests the world fell apart",6746,6853
16,Hillary Clintons policies produced ruin in Libya Iraq and Syria,7217,7280
17,"She failed in Russia in China in North Korea."" Her policies unleashed ISIS spread terrorism and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons – not to mention the ransom payments",7595,7767
18,"""On top of it all Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy",8082,8132
19,Shes raced to invade intervene and topple regimes,8522,8571
20,"She believes in globalism not Americanism."" ""Last night she even falsely said no American died in Libya",8926,9029
21,"Then she also falsely said theres no ground troops in Iraq even though we have 5000 military personnel there right now."" Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race",9333,9505
22,I opposed going in and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out – letting ISIS fill the void,9768,9874
23,But I was opposed to the war from the beginning,10180,10227
24,"Long after Howard Stern but three months before the Iraq war started I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto that ""perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet"" and that ""the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned."" Then On March 25th of 2003 just days after the war started I was quoted as saying the war is ""a mess"" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start",10391,10796
25,"In July of 2003 I said that ""I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places because you know they really need and it they need it badly."" I had a number of quotes to this effect",10824,11098
26,Then in August of 2004 very early in the conflict I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine,11280,11377
27,"""Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that were in",11674,11724
28,I would never have handled it that way,12052,12090
29,Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? Cmon,12335,12562
30,Two minutes after we leave theres going to be a revolution and the meanest toughest smartest most vicious guy will take over,12774,12898
31,"""What was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed",13203,13289
32,And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side,13605,13698
33,All those Iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces,14019,14066
34,And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong,14397,14470
35,"All this for nothing!"" I would have been tougher on terrorism",14790,14851
36,"Bin Laden would have been caught long ago."" ""Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion I would have cast a vote in opposition",15138,15272
37,"For years I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clintons failed career."" Here is the bottom line: I was a private citizen",15503,15706
38,I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had,15991,16048
39,But in Iraq my judgement was right and hers was wrong,16407,16460
40,"""Hillary Clinton is always complaining about whats wrong but shes been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it – all you have to do is look at New York State when she was a Senator",16720,16926
41,"All talk but nothing happened."" ""Were on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."" Meanwhile massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair",17114,17300
42,"""Its time to rebuild America."" Too many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream",17578,17699
43,We are one nation and when any part of our country hurts – our whole country hurts,17995,18077
44,My goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation – African-American Hispanic-American all Americans – will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education and a great job,18347,18545
45,That ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety,18850,18903
46,In order to help our children succeed our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community,19222,19345
47,"""You cant have prosperity without security."" This is the new civil rights agenda of our time",19646,19738
48,The right to a safe community a quality education and a secure job,20068,20134
49,Our campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a New American Future,20453,20583
50,There is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly,20926,21024
51,The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success,21353,21533
52,It is time to break-up that monopoly,21898,21934
53,I want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom – the civil right – to attend the school of their choice,22232,22397
54,This includes private schools traditional public schools magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice,22670,22819
55,"""Our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative – with billions left over",23156,23261
56,"Its simply a matter of putting students first not the education bureaucracy."" ""Lets run through the numbers."" ""At the state and federal level the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year",23547,23764
57,"Thats an average of about $12296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools."" The federal government pays for about 10 percent—$64 billion to be precise—of the K-12 costs",24008,24209
58,That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S,24520,24589
59,Department of Education,24978,25001
60,The other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states,25385,25461
61,We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world,25808,25882
62,Yet our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries,26231,26318
63,Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools,26674,26753
64,New York City spends $20226 dollars per pupil,27123,27168
65,Baltimore spends $15287 dollars per student,27565,27608
66,Chicago spends $11976 dollars per student and in Los Angeles it is $10602,27996,28069
67,Just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money – allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice,28368,28557
68,Not only would this empower families but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes,28834,28966
69,"""These schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family – not the needs of the Teachers Union",29278,29397
70,"There is no more important job than a teacher and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms."" The current government monopoly while great for the bureaucrats has utterly failed too many students",29676,29877
71,According to the National Assessment of Education Progress only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading,30187,30349
72,Failing schools then contribute to failing economies,30736,30788
73,In Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent,31191,31284
74,In Baltimore it is 16.2 percent 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City,31645,31734
75,In Los Angeles 26 percent of African American women live in poverty,32081,32148
76,In Baltimore the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent,32517,32582
77,In New York over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty,32944,33008
78,Nationwide nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty – including 45% of children under the age of six,33351,33466
79,Our public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success,33796,33870
80,"""Meanwhile we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities – which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for Americas children."" Violent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015",34145,34380
81,Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%,34688,34727
82,There have been nearly 3000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year,35100,35176
83,Government is failing our citizens at every level,35545,35594
84,That is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America,35944,36044
85,That means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public private or religious school of their choice,36349,36465
86,Here is how it will work,36832,36856
87,Right now about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide,37252,37340
88,These are opportunity scholarships tax credits and education savings accounts,37739,37816
89,This covers about 400000 students in our country,38249,38297
90,Altogether school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide,38748,38825
91,Charter schools in particular have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration,39191,39391
92,They also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone,39761,39831
93,My first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice,40237,40343
94,This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars,40739,40799
95,Specifically my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty,41149,41298
96,We will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend,41583,41700
97,Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws encouraging them to participate,42025,42150
98,This $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students,42508,42579
99,A state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds,42965,43024
100,Ohio is a leader in school choice,43421,43454
101,Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30000 students and 384 charter schools serving 123844 students,43822,43942
102,But the $20 billion is only the beginning,44304,44345
103,As President I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty,44708,44824
104,That means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public private charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family,45117,45276
105,Each state will develop its own formula but we want the dollars to follow the student,45553,45638
106,9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level,45941,46018
107,To achieve this long-term goal we will have to make this a shared national mission – to bring hope to every child in every city in this land,46279,46419
108,I will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city state and federal level who support school choice,46621,46820
109,My Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America – Chicago Baltimore Detroit – that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community,47042,47248
110,In Baltimore for instance that would mean more than $15000 funds available per student,47527,47613
111,I am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore,47919,48014
112,If we can put a man on the moon dig out the Panama Canal and win two World Wars then I have no doubt that we as a nation can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America,48225,48411
113,If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars that could provide $12000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty,48622,48875
114,The money will follow the student,49155,49188
115,That means the student will be able to attend the public private charter or magnet school of their choice – and each state will develop its own system that works best for them,49490,49665
116,"""As your President I will be the nations biggest cheerleader for school choice",49962,50040
117,I understand many stale old politicians will resist,50399,50450
118,But its time for our country to start thinking big once again,50820,50881
119,"We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead."" I will also support merit-pay for teachers so that we reward great teachers – instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones",51123,51425
120,At the same time we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college,51631,51749
121,My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities,52066,52183
122,My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year,52481,52649
123,By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities,52962,53079
124,"""Crucially my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America",53455,53529
125,We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world – thats money coming straight out of states like Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan Maine and so many others,53858,54031
126,"By ending foreign currency manipulation product dumping and other predatory trading practices we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America."" The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation and exciting opportunities for our children",54273,54554
127,"""All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past",54812,54883
128,Weve had a failed foreign policy,55259,55291
129,A failed education policy,55688,55713
130,A failed economic policy,56103,56127
131,"And underneath it all a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have – or how many journalists they know – not how many Americans they help to live better lives."" But the failures of the past are about to end",56414,56656
132,Those failures end beginning on November 8th,56913,56957
133,We will have One American Nation,57323,57355
134,We will be One American People,57717,57747
135,We are fighting to give every child in every forgotten stretch of this country the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace,58073,58207
136,That means a safe neighborhood a quality education and a secure high-paying job,58557,58636
137,This is how we will rebuild our future,59041,59079
138,This is how We Will Make America Great Again – For Everyone,59484,59543
139,Thank you,59948,59957
