0,""" Were going to get right to our lead guest former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is in Chappaqua New York this morning."" Good morning Secretary Clinton",0,160
1,I want to start with politics,575,604
2,Were going to talk about a lot today but lets start with politics,1006,1071
3,"A new NBC/""Wall Street Journal""/Marist poll says in Iowa its 48-45 you over Sanders",1407,1490
4,You were once way ahead,1832,1855
5,So whats happening?  Oh John you know these polls go up they go down,2182,2249
6,"""I stay pretty focused as I think we all should on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration but go even further",2512,2654
7,"And thats why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can."" And those are some of the differences that I have with my primary opponents and certainly very deep differences with all the Republicans running",2822,3122
8, This week another batch of your e-mails were released by the State Department,3353,3430
9,One of them is a back-and-forth between you and a staffer about a secure fax that wont come through,3771,3870
10,"And you directed him to -- quote -- ""turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure."" ""Arent you ordering him to violate the laws on handling classified material there?""  No not at all",4144,4347
11,"""And as the State Department said just this week that did not happen",4641,4709
12,And it never would have happened because thats just not the way I treated classified information,5065,5161
13,Headings are not classification notices,5534,5573
14,"And so oftentimes were trying to get the best information we can."" ""And obviously what Im asking for is whatever can be transmitted if it doesnt come through secure to be transmitted on the unclassified system",5907,6116
15,"So no there is nothing to that like so much else that has been talked about in the last year.""  So in no instance -- what is striking about that particular e-mail is it suggests you were very facile with how to do this this process",6295,6525
16,You knew the instructions about how to get around the restrictions for sending classified information,6771,6872
17,"""So youre saying there was never an instance any other instance in which you did that?"" "" No",7194,7286
18,And it wasnt sent,7637,7654
19,So I think this is another instance where what is common practice -- namely look I need information,7990,8089
20,I had some points I had to make,8400,8431
21,"And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture."" ""But oftentimes theres a lot of information that isnt at all classified",8759,8904
22,So whatever information can appropriately transmitted unclassified often was,9241,9317
23,"Thats true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government."" ""But the important point here is I had great confidence because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years",9658,9863
24,He is the most meticulous careful person you could possibly do business with,10159,10235
25,"And he knew exactly what was and wasnt appropriate."" ""And in fact as the State Department has said there was no transmission of any classified information",10560,10714
26,So its another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall as you said in the beginning of the program to see what sticks,10990,11132
27,"But theres no there there.""  Well this one is a little different since the FBI is investigating this specific question of whether a classification was meddled with",11407,11569
28,Let me ask you about another e-mail in this batch which was one in which you seemed to express surprise that somebody e-mailed on their non-State Department personal e-mail which is what you were doing,11825,12026
29,Why was that a surprise to you?  Well I e-mailed two people on their government accounts because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system,12273,12431
30,"""And indeed the vast majority of all my e-mails are in the government system",12708,12784
31,So thats how I conducted the business,13146,13183
32,"I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts.""  On gun control this week you have been pretty tough on Bernie Sanders specifically on the question of legal protection to gun manufacturers",13478,13727
33,"""He has now said that he would be interested in looking to changing the law to allow -- to go after gun manufacturers who act irresponsibly",13964,14103
34,"So isnt that what you want?"" "" No thats not what I want",14394,14449
35,And thats not what the country wants,14789,14825
36,And thats not what President Obama called for,15189,15234
37,"And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability."" ""Its the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences",15485,15786
38,You know President Obama and I and Senator Sanders were all in the Senate at the same time,15988,16078
39,Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby,16359,16474
40,Senator Sanders voted with them and through this morning has been unwilling to join the president and me in saying that this should be repealed,16750,16893
41,That has to be the effort that we all are behind,17187,17235
42,And he often says well look Im from Vermont and its different,17566,17627
43,"Its not like being in New York City."" Well in fact the other senator from Vermont Senator Leahy voted with President Obama and myself",17917,18050
44,So I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years points up a clear difference,18312,18492
45,"""And its a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account",18777,18858
46,Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 peoples lives a day? Im pretty clear on what I will do,19121,19283
47,"And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating."" "" On Senator Sanders response this idea that he represents a state which there are lot of gun owners you were a senator",19486,19692
48,You -- arent you sympathetic to that? You said you represented Wall Street and thats what shaped your views on certain Wall Street policy,19933,20070
49,"And you have suggested that as president you would be different than you did as senator when you were representing a state with a constituency.""  Well..",20354,20505
50,""" So why isnt it fair for Bernie Sanders to say as president I would be different than I would as a senator representing a state with a lot of gun owners?""  Well you know I think you have really mixed up two important issues here",20710,20938
51,I have been consistent on gun lobby restrictions,21186,21234
52,In fact I supported the Brady Bill,21594,21628
53,Senator Sanders voted against it five times,21978,22021
54,So there is a very clear difference,22369,22404
55,"""And when it comes to Wall Street yes I represented New York",22743,22803
56,And I was proud to do so,23146,23170
57,And I took on Wall Street,23527,23552
58,Im the person who came out against derivatives,23893,23939
59,"Im the person who came out calling for restrictions on CEO pay which thankfully got into the Dodd- Frank bill."" ""Im the person who went to Wall Street and actually confronted them in 2007",24217,24404
60,I called them out on the role they were playing in the mortgage market,24669,24739
61,"So I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry including Wall Street."" And I will continue to do so as president",25002,25164
62,And the proposal that I have put forth about how we rein in the excesses of Wall Street so we never again face what we did in 2008 has been judged as being more comprehensive tougher more effective by Barney Frank by Sherrod Brown my friend from Ohio who leads the banking efforts in the Senate and by Paul Krugman,25301,25615
63,So I have plan that will go after not just the big banks because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry,25751,25923
64, Right,26205,26210
65,""" And I think Im well-prepared",26570,26600
66,I know what needs to be done,26946,26974
67,"Its kind of like Nixon going to China John.""  All right Senator let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face",27276,27400
68,That is Donald Trump,27704,27724
69,You got into a pretty ugly exchange,28083,28118
70,You charged that he -- you charged him with sexism and then he put out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky,28423,28548
71,"Your reaction to that? "" Well if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past thats his prerogative",28824,28931
72,"You know so be it."" ""Im going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women raising the minimum wage which affects two-thirds of the women who are the ones receiving the minimum wage protecting a womans right to make the most personal health care decisions."" ""Thats why Im so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire because Im going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood something that he supports."" ""So there are very clear distinctions",28985,29584
73,He can say whatever he wants to about me,29670,29710
74,Let the voters judge that,30070,30095
75,But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made,30420,30524
76,Its been too hard-fought-for,30836,30864
77,"And Im going to stand up and make it clear theres a huge difference between us."" "" Secretary Clinton what do you say though to those even in your own party who say that -- a discussion of that portion of your husbands career is fair game to talk about in an election?"" "" Well its been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years",31066,31405
78,They can do it again if they want to,31592,31628
79,That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign,31936,31994
80,Didnt work before,32310,32327
81,"It wont work again because it is what people are focused on not for the past but for the future."" ""What are we going to do to get wages rising? What are we going to do to create more good jobs? What are we going to do keep rights? What are we going to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it who will defend womens rights who will defend marriage equality who will defend voter rights?"" ""So I cant run anybody elses campaign",32463,32903
82,They can say whatever they want,33055,33086
83,More power to them,33458,33476
84,I think its a dead end blind alley for them but let them go,33832,33891
85,Im going to talk about the differences between us because I think thats what Americans care about,34198,34295
86,""" "" Secretary Clinton Im afraid were at a dead end ourselves and out of time",34639,34715
87,"""   Thanks so much for being with us",35097,35131
88,""" Thanks",35513,35521
89,"Lets continue the conversation John.""  See you out there",35903,35958
