14,"""Brian Williams career was destroyed for saying far less."" Yesterday she even tried to attack me and my many businesses",5644,5763
15,But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York not so long ago with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars,6031,6179
16,I have always had a talent for building businesses and importantly creating jobs,6470,6550
17,That is a talent our country desperately needs,6900,6946

22,The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests,8900,9035

27,They totally own her and that will never change,11082,11129
28,The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control,11459,11643
29,Those are the stakes,11982,12002
30,"""Hillary Clinton wants to be President",12412,12450

32,"Her campaign slogan is ""Im with her."" ""You know what my response to that is? Im with you: the American people."" ""She thinks its all about her.""

33,"""We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on whats good for Americas middle class – to a policy of globalism focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.""

40,"Our first Republican President Abraham Lincoln warned us by saying: ""The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."" I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton",16627,16942
41,"""Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clintons disastrous NAFTA just like she supported Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization."" ""Weve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed."" ""Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clintons time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated but rather scorned."" Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day",16991,17546
42,Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs and effectively let China completely rebuild itself,17691,17795

64,Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians,27069,27137
65,Thanks to Hillary Clinton Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons,27490,27608

""She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood",27813,28123
67,"The Egyptian military has retaken control but Clinton has opened the Pandoras box of radical Islam."" Then there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers",28300,28538
68,ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made,28842,28915
69,ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East and peaceful Muslims across the world who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety,29215,29428
70,"""In short Hillary Clintons tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another."" It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place",29665,29867
71,Though I was not in government service I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war and yes even before the war ever started,30106,30239
72,"""But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq because when she got into power she couldnt wait to rush us off to war in Libya."" She lacks the temperament the judgment and the competence to lead",30472,30666
73,"In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office: ""She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasnt changed a bit."" ""Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clintons foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam."" ""In fact Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States and thats an increase over President Obamas already very high number.""

77,Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death,32728,32827
78,Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department,33149,33274
79,Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency,33603,33677
80,Here is some more of what we learned from the book Clinton Cash: To cover-up her corrupt dealings Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server,33994,34173
81,Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger,34461,34606
82,Then there are the 33000 emails she deleted,34931,34974
83,While we may not know what is in those deleted emails our enemies probably do,35324,35401
84,So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States,35719,35821
85,This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency,36162,36214

109,This is our last chance to do it,46318,46350
110,Americans are the people that tamed the West that dug out the Panama Canal that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams and so much more,46625,46787
111,Then we started thinking small,47104,47134
112,We stopped believing in what America could do and became reliant on other countries other people and other institutions,47487,47606
113,We lost our sense of purpose and daring,47947,47986
