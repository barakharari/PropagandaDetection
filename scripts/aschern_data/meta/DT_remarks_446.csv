2,She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today,958,1126
3,I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children who has been such a leader on these issues,1359,1563
4,We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn Lummis Black and Ellmers,1866,1994
5,"""Our campaign is about ideas",2357,2385
6,Were about solutions,2823,2843
7,"Ive travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family."" ""Ive outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice reforming our tax and regulatory code lifting restrictions on American energy rebuilding our military changing our foreign policy fixing our immigration policy and keeping our country safe."" ""Right now our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things",3082,3554
8,"Im asking the nation to lift our sights and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together trust each other and put the needs of our own citizens first."" We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected",3615,3912
9,"""We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C",4143,4193
10,that looks down on everyday hardworking people,4579,4625
11,"Too often those who have power have disdain for the views beliefs and attitudes of those who dont have political power."" Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford childcare",4913,5193
12,That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work and to have access to affordable quality child care for their kids,5427,5568
13,We want higher pay better wages and a growing economy for everyone,5891,5957
14,These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force,6270,6388
15,Today nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs,6709,6766
16,For many families in our country childcare is now the single largest expense – even more than housing,7085,7186
17,Yet very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area – and my opponent has no childcare plan,7485,7590
18,Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster – a sick kid a lost job a damaged home,7883,7975
19,There is no financial security,8325,8355
20,But that will all change under our pro-family pro-child pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight,8719,8814
21,Before going any further I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan,9135,9248
22,The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America – including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians – to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes,9525,9719
23,They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state from birth through the age of 13,9992,10105
24,Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families,10394,10513
25,The deduction also applies to elder care capped at a $5000-dollar deduction per year,10840,10924
26,Importantly our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions to their families and to our society,11265,11430
27,Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes,11746,11858
28,For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate,12147,12302
29,Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax – a major relief for low-income parents,12575,12713
30,This translates to as much as an extra $1200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families,13015,13105
31,"""Next our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account",13439,13528
32,Families can contribute up to $2000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free,13884,13972
33,"Crucially unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today these accounts will be available to all Americans – you wont have to depend on your employer to provide them."" Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account each of which is designated for a specific child including an unborn child",14224,14548
34,"""The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care but also child enrichment activities",14768,14888
35,Additionally the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year – they dont revert to employers or to the Treasury,15163,15291
36,"Instead the funds rollover – so while only $2000 dollars can be contributed each year unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings."" These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms I outlined last week",15513,15814
37,The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18,16056,16112
38,Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education,16465,16557
39,For low-income individuals the federal government will provide matching funds – if parents contribute $1000 dollars the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match,16887,17059
40,To help low-income families reach these targets and save money we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts,17318,17556
41,These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents,17849,17944
42,Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions,18339,18431
43,The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions,18821,18914
44,But to make sure these solutions are available especially in low-income and rural communities we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities,19272,19439
45,We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them,19779,19849
46,In this era of the sharing economy we want parents to be able to access lower-cost competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button – including services like nanny-sharing,20158,20342
47,Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents,20678,20747
48,Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well,21126,21208
49,This can often be a good solution for many working parents and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time,21549,21658
50,Currently only 7% of employers provide these services,22018,22071
51,Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit,22421,22626
52,Finally our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave,22960,23076
53,This solution will receive strong bipartisan support and will be completely self-financing,23474,23564
54,By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit,23911,24117
55,This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and again this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program,24389,24559
56,There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan and you can review them all on the website,24868,24969
57,On Thursday I will outline my full economic plan which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings,25303,25440
58,Together our tax trade regulatory and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth,25775,25878
59,"""These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President",26236,26322
60,"Its time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in and instead to work together – not as Republicans or Democrats – but as Americans to achieve real positive results for the American people."" While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable I call you hard-working American Patriots who love your country love your families and want a better future for all Americans",26491,26897
61,"""Its time to end the rule of special interests and to begin the rule of the American people."" ""Its time to stop fighting over the smallest words and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead."" It is time to Believe In America",26995,27238
62,Together We Will Make Our Country Strong Again,27606,27652
63,We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again,28071,28112
64,And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone,28531,28581
