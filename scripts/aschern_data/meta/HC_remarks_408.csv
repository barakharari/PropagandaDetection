11,One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign,4386,4467
12,I know – Ive gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half,4745,4826
13,Im grateful for each and every one of them,5131,5173
14,But I got to say theres something special about this one,5494,5550
15,And its a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me,5855,5921
16,Now not everyone knows this,6232,6259
17,I mean you all know what an amazing athlete he his – MVP winner of championships – but hes also – LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children,6546,6692
18,"And this afternoon Ill be in Akron where hes done so much for the kids in that community."" ""Its a deep personal commitment that he has that I share with him",6935,7091
19,We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential,7345,7447
20,"I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch."" ""Now one thing I know – Ill just say it because I know its for sure – I hope to be elected president but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King."" I was listening to Kenyetta introduce me and I really appreciated what she said because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard look after one another and yes pay their taxes right? You recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together and it matters",7510,8046
21,We believe honest work deserves honest pay,8146,8188
22,We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back,8530,8626
23,"""Its personal for me",8968,8988
24,Im the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton Pennsylvania,9345,9412
25,He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years,9725,9785
26,He believed he passed it down to my dad who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do hed have a good life and his kids would have an even better life,10009,10180
27,That is the American dream,10419,10445
28,That is what we believe in,10790,10816
29,"Thats what weve got to keep going generation after generation."" ""And because of my grandfathers hard work my dad made it to college",11126,11257
30,"And then after serving in the Navy during World War II he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies."" ""As a young girl Id sometimes go to his print plant",11520,11692
31,It was a long building no natural light no windows but he had these long tables where hed roll out the fabric and then Id watch him work with silkscreens if youve ever seen that,11911,12088
32,He would take the silkscreen hed put it down hed pour the paint in hed take the squeegee go across all the way down to the end of one table then over to the next table all the way back,12276,12460
33,And then if there was a second color to be added he would do that,12676,12741
34,He sometimes let me help with the squeegee,13040,13082
35,"That was my favorite part."" And I know he worked really hard",13396,13456
36,He worked really hard,13782,13803
37,He believed in hard work,14157,14181
38,He passed that on to me,14538,14561
39,He provided a good middle-class life for us,14902,14945
40,So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo Ohio and America who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream which should be big enough for everybody,15211,15407
41,"""Fighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life as Kenyetta said when I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund all those years ago",15625,15774
42,"And it will be the mission of my presidency because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues the ones that keep you up at night – like the cost of child care and college and prescription drugs and so much else."" ""And that means weve got to create more good jobs with rising incomes",15939,16235
43,That means weve got to have good schools in every zip code,16440,16498
44,That means everybody willing to work – and I say that very clearly; youve got to be willing to work – and if youre willing to work you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead,16750,16927
45,"That is the basic bargain."" ""Now I dont know about you but you wouldnt think that the theme of my campaign getting an economy to work for everyone not just those at the top would be controversial – and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time."" Now I will say most American companies – most – are run by honorable patriotic people who care about their employees and communities",17015,17433
46,But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else,17565,17697
47,Applause,18068,18076
48,And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers workers small businesses and taxpayers,18431,18615
49,"""That makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road",18922,18992
50,"And it gets even harder when we dont aggressively enforce the rules when we dont enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up when we dont enforce rules on Wall Street which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value investing in workers plant and equipment over the longer term."" ""And lets be honest the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States",19107,19683
51,And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse,19786,19890
52,"It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that cant afford lawyers and lobbyists."" ""So with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction its even more important that we have an election about these very issues",20167,20400
53,"Because what I know will happen – if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field we will rebuild the middle class we will make work pay we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans."" Now I know how hard this but I think we are on the cusp if we win this election to be able to get these things done right?""  ""Yeah.""  ""That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector",20447,20948
54,Weve got unmatched talent innovation entrepreneurial spirit,21083,21142
55,So when we work together we can all benefit,21573,21616
56,"""Now I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders – but to their workers to their customers to their communities and yes to our country to the United States of America",21915,22190
57,We have been moving off track for decades,22448,22489
58,I dont need to tell you that,22830,22858
59,You know it youve lived it youve seen it,23189,23229
60,"But it is time to get back on track."" ""And you can ask anybody whos ever worked for me or worked with me whos ever served with me when I tell you Im going to try to do something I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you."" ""So lets begin by making it clear that for most businesses America is the most important asset on their balance sheet",23379,23737
61,This country of ours this system of ours the rule of law the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you,23862,24013
62,And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world the American middle class,24277,24368
63,So when we middle class thrives the country thrives,24685,24736
64,"And when it doesnt we dont right?"" ""And Im going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable",25038,25204
65,"Standing up for America investing in America will pay off."" Now we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value",25460,25619
66,But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else,25919,26006
67,So today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers exploit your employees pollute our environment or rip off taxpayers we will find ways to hold you accountable,26269,26502
68,"""But on the other side – on the other side if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our countrys future we will stand with you",26701,26868
69,That is the choice,27149,27167
70,"Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better."" ""Now to understand why this is so important consider the recent examples weve seen of egregious corporate behavior."" ""Look at Wells Fargo",27481,27676
71,Really shocking isnt it? One of the nations biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent even their knowledge misusing personal information and then sticking customers with hidden fees,27924,28236
72,"It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law."" ""And then in a category by himself theres Donald Trump",28450,28671
73,Well you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades,28900,29038
74,You can look at 40 years of my tax returns,29322,29364
75,"I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties you have to release your tax returns."" ""Now a lot of us were wondering what is he hiding? It must be really terrible",29606,29801
76,Well The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer,30048,30114
77,Back in the 1990s Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos,30421,30534
78,Now how anybody can lose a dollar let alone a billion dollars in the casino industry is kind of beyond me,30822,30927
79,Its just hard to figure,31246,31269
80,"But as a result it doesnt look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades."" ""Now while millions of American families including mine and yours were working hard paying our fair share it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation",31531,31785
81,Imagine that,32070,32082
82,Not fair,32494,32502
83,Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college,32890,32940
84,Nothing for veterans,33333,33353
85,Nothing for our military,33752,33776
86,And you know he has been dissing America in this whole campaign,34142,34205
87,Right? He talks us down,34570,34593
88,He makes disparaging comments about our country,34967,35014
89,He calls our military a disaster,35379,35411
90,"Well its not but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform."" ""I saw a newspaper article",35717,35869
91,A gentleman named Steve Crouse who owns the Glass City Café here in Toledo summed it up pretty well in this article,36122,36237
92,He said I would feel guilty if I didnt pay anything,36554,36605
93,Its flat-out cheating the government,36983,37019
94,"Now my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about."" ""Trump represents the same rigged system that he claims hes going to change",37320,37549
95,The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business,37814,37895
96,After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money he didnt lift a finger to help and protect his employees or all the small businesses and contractors hed hired or the people of Atlantic City,38152,38350
97,They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire,38588,38713
98,And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies,38998,39160
99,"In other words Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill."" ""Now he says that hes the one who can fix things but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse",39389,39593
100,Right? And heres what I really am just stunned by,39831,39880
101,I get stunned every day in this campaign,40193,40233
102,But heres one of the many things that Im stunned by,40550,40601
103,He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more,40901,40967
104,It would be like youre paying zero,41273,41307
105,You expect us to pay you to stay in business all the rest of us in America? Hed open the loopholes even wider,41600,41709
106,And according to a new independent study he would actually – listen to this people because this is a real shocker – his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families,41946,42135
107,"And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents whose lives and challenges he doesnt care about certainly doesnt understand."" ""Now many have likely already spent years paying more than he did and he now would make that even worse",42336,42586
108,And what does he say about it? Well did you all see the debate last Monday? Well in the debate – in the debate – well then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes,42737,42934
109,Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius,43175,43232
110,"Heres my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?"" ""This is Trump to a T",43536,43639
111,Hes taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it,43948,44011
112,He abuses his power games the system puts his own interests ahead of the countrys,44344,44425
113,Its Trump first and everyone else last,44764,44802
114,And there are lots of principled law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this,45138,45242
115,Not a single – not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trumps campaign,45559,45640
116,Think about it,45997,46011
117,Ive been endorsed by very successful people – Warren Buffett Mike Bloomberg Mark Cuban,46372,46458
118,I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me,46800,46848
119,He said Look Ive been successful,47225,47257
120,He actually is a real billionaire,47641,47674
121,And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees not bankruptcy to fire people,48020,48113
122,And when he sold his first company he shared the profits with his employees and 300 of them became millionaires,48431,48542
123,"Thats the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country."" ""But heres what weve got to do",48824,48930
124,Even if Trump is like one of a kind weve got to reverse the broader trends he represents,49202,49290
125,Its time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone,49596,49665
126,And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers consumers small businesses and workers,49993,50107
127,"Were going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs in higher wages and in stronger communities."" ""First lets start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system",50354,50626
128,It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules,50882,50966
129,A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse,51276,51372
130,And Ill tell you something else,51695,51726
131,Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all,52058,52145
132,It is insulting when they engage in these games like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country – on paper not in reality – just to take advantage of lower tax rates,52418,52592
133,"And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand."" ""So heres what were going to do",52814,52964
134,Were going to close those loopholes,53255,53290
135,Ive got a list of them were going after,53658,53697
136,Were going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes,54054,54155
137,Were going to pass something called the Buffett rule which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them,54474,54632
138,Were going to put in place a new exit tax,54963,55004
139,If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share if they try to outsource jobs theyre going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country,55280,55464
140,"And then were going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America."" ""Second were going to protect consumers",55726,55852
141,No American should ever be taken advantage of like thousands were by Wells Fargo,56166,56246
142,And this isnt a new fight for me,56612,56644
143,As a Senator I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages,57042,57098
144,I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids,57461,57568
145,I introduced legislation to protect Americans personal data and combat identity theft,57941,58026
146,"So as president I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government."" ""And that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau which was created after the financial crisis",58369,58594
147,And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren,58925,58997
148,And under the leadership of Ohios Rich Cordray the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders credit card companies and others,59307,59515
149,"And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back."" ""Now I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done",59746,59904
150,Sometimes people say well what does the government really do? Well theres a lot of examples but this is a primary one standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off,60103,60297
151,And because of its success Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down,60565,60643
152,And Donald Trump agrees with them,60978,61011
153,In fact he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis,61335,61424
154,Well not on my watch Donald,61764,61791
155,"Were never going to let that happen."" Now instead of gutting consumer protection we should be expanding it",62136,62242
156,And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again,62540,62693
157,And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address,62998,63092
158,When the scams victims people like you and me who had accounts there tried to sue they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated,63322,63563
159,Instead they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law,63805,63932
160,"We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print ""gotchas"" to escape accountability",64253,64362
161,"""And in fact this is now common practice across a lot of industries – from nursing homes nursing homes that mistreat seniors to for-profit colleges that defraud students",64661,64830
162,Who reads all that fine print? I dont,65154,65191
163,And you get defrauded or you get mistreated and then all of a sudden they say Well you cant sue us,65515,65613
164,"So were going to rein in that abuse across everybody."" ""We also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership",65900,66059
165,It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else,66384,66472
166,Its one of the reasons Im against it,66844,66880
167,"Ive warned about this for years Ive written about it and I oppose TPP now I will oppose it after the election I will oppose it as president – because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers."" ""And what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? Were going to have to protect ourselves against that too",67076,67417
168,"And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding life-saving drugs we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs."" ""And lets finally import safe alternatives from other countries like Canada and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market",67522,67828
169,And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients,68042,68171
170,And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine,68455,68553
171,"No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions."" ""So lets stand up for taxpayers",68866,68989
172,Lets stand up for consumers,69342,69369
173,And lets stand up for small businesses which create most of the jobs in America,69728,69807
174,I take this personally be-cause of my dads very small business,70159,70221
175,"We need fair rules of the road so big corporations cant use their power to gain unfair advantages."" ""Now when it comes to bullying small businesses Donald Trump is the poster boy",70522,70700
176,I have heard so many stories of contractors and Ive met some too who worked for him produced the goods and services and never got paid for what they were owed,70936,71094
177,Im talking about painters and plumbers piano sellers architects glass installers – he stiffed them all,71382,71484
178,Not because he couldnt pay them but he wouldnt pay them,71808,71863
179,And he told them You want to get your money? Sue me,72200,72251
180,My dad could never have done that,72590,72623

183,So as president I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field,73743,73863
184,Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy,74192,74275
185,Sometimes its called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes as well as consumers,74620,74767
186,"With less competition corporations can use their power to raise prices limit choice for consumers cut wages for workers crowd out startups and small businesses."" ""I mean look whats happening right now",75071,75271

189,"As president I will appoint tough independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions so the big dont keep getting bigger and bigger."" ""I want every business to compete and thrive and then I also want to do something else",76396,76673
190,Lets protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy,76952,77015
