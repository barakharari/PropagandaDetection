45,But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the Constitution,18429,18582

77,If your family makes more than that youre not going to have to go into debt – pay what you can afford and then were going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt because that drags people down,31404,31607

89,"And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250000 a year.n"" ""So when you go to the polls vote to grow the economy more jobs with rising incomes vote to make the economy fairer",36055,36242
90,And compare that with what my opponent has proposed,36527,36578
91,He really believes if you give trillions – thats trillions with a t – trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires billionaires big corporations everything will trickle down,36906,37084
92,Now we know that doesnt work; weve seen it,37395,37437

94,He says not making taxes makes him smart,38129,38169

105,He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world,42438,42494
106,So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself,42823,42876
107,And at some point you got to say wait a minute were better than that,43200,43268
108,We are stronger than that,43607,43632

140,I want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good high-paying jobs and in new industries like clean energy and advanced manufacturing,55922,56076
141,I want us to be a country where hard-working immigrants who pay taxes – and by the way one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump paid,56323,56544
142,And a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare where were respected in the world working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons,56764,56965
