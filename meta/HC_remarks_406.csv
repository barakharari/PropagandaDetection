and so honored to be here, 20, 26
Thank you so much Reverend Dr, 26, 32
Walker, 32, 33

and it has .., 166, 170
the world outside challenged the faith that comes from belief, 170, 180
In here in this magnificent house of worship we pray for peace when there is too much violence outside of these walls, 180, 202
In here we are called to confront injustice even when the world out there fails to see it, 202, 220
In here we see the world as it is but we pray for the strength and wisdom to build the world as it should be, 220, 245
"It has been 12 days since Mr, 245, 252
Scott was shot and killed, 252, 257
Twelve days since his wife Rakeiya Scott watched her husband die and seven children lost their father, 257, 274
Now we dont yet know all the details about the shooting but we do know this family and this community is in pain, 274, 297
And therefore we pray for them and we pray for all families who have suffered similar losses, 297, 314
But we do more than pray, 314, 320
As Ms, 320, 322
Bradford said We do what each of us can do, 322, 332
Not everyone can march but everyone can talk and everyone can reach out and everyone can vote." Too many African American families have been in the same tragic situation that the Scott family has found themselves, 332, 368
In fact the day before Mr, 368, 374
Scott died another father Terence Crutcher was killed in a police encounter in Tulsa Oklahoma, 374, 389
And there have been many others, 389, 395
So many fathers and sons and even mothers and daughters who have died either after encounters with the police or at the hands of civilians with guns while they were doing things that were ordinary everyday activities, 395, 432
Walking home from the store with iced tea and Skittles listening to music in their car with friends, 432, 450
And we also know -- and we must not forget -- that violence has touched the families of police officers, 450, 470
Men and women who put on the uniform and put their lives on the line to protect others, 470, 488
From Dallas to Baton Rouge to Philadelphia the families of fallen officers have also been dealt a great blow and they deserve our prayers as well, 488, 514
"Its been a hard year hasnt it? Think about how many times President Obama has had to console our nation about another senseless tragedy another shattered family another distressed community, 514, 544
And our children are watching and they feel it too, 544, 554
Youve seen that right here in Charlotte, 554, 561
Last Monday at the city council meeting 10-year-old Taje Gaddy said I wake up every morning scared that I wont get to grow up because I am black." "A nine-year-old Zianna Oliphant whos here with us today along with her brother Marquis and her family also spoke at that city council meeting with tears pouring down her face, 561, 619
And when I read what she had said I had tears in my eyes too, 619, 634
She said We are black people and we shouldnt have to feel like this, 634, 648
Its a shame that our fathers and mothers are killed and we cant even see them anymore, 648, 665
Its a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them, 665, 679
We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side, 679, 690
What courage and clarity that young lady showed to the world." "But can you imagine nine years old, 690, 708
She should be thinking about happy adventures dreaming about all the wonderful things her future holds for her, 708, 726
Instead shes talking about graveyards, 726, 731
Our entire country should take a moment to really look at whats going on here and across America to imagine what we see on the news and what we hear about imagine through our childrens eyes." "Im a grandmother and like every grandmother I worry about the safety and security of my grandchildren but my worries are not the same as black grandmothers, 731, 794
They have different and deeper fears about the world that their grandchildren face, 794, 807
It makes my heart ache when kids like Zianna are going through this and trying to make sense of the absolutely senseless, 807, 829
I know how I would feel, 829, 835
I wouldnt be able to stand it if my grandchildren had to be scared and worried the way too many children across our country feel right now, 835, 862
But because my grandchildren are white because they are the grandchildren of a former president and secretary of state lets be honest here – they wont face the kind of fear that we heard from the young children testifying before the city council." "You know every child deserves the same sense of security every child deserves the same hope, 862, 921
They should not be facing fear they should be learning and growing imagining who they can be and what their contributions to our country could be as well, 921, 949
Weve got to take action weve got to start now not tomorrow not next year now, 949, 965
We know we cant solve all these problems over night which means we dont have a moment to lose." "Proverbs tells us Where there is no vision the people perish, 965, 995
So lets hold on to a common vision, 995, 1003
Lets come together to make America a place where every child no matter who they are where theyre born or what they look like has the chance to live up to their God-given potential." Being stronger together with this common vision means rejecting those forces that try to pit us against each other, 1003, 1056
We can acknowledge that implicit bias still exists not just in police departments but throughout our country without vilifying police officers, 1056, 1077
We can call for reforms to policing while still appreciating the many courageous and admirable officers out there who are doing their jobs with honor and integrity, 1077, 1104
"I think about an officer named Montrell Jackson, 1104, 1112
You might not have heard of him but I want you to, 1112, 1124
He was one of the officers murdered in Baton Rouge, 1124, 1134
A few days before he died he wrote on Facebook he was black but he wore blue, 1134, 1151
In uniform he wrote I get nasty hateful looks, 1151, 1160
Out of uniform some consider me a threat, 1160, 1168
These are trying times, 1168, 1172
Please dont let hate infect your heart, 1172, 1179
And then he closed by saying that if anyone saw him on patrol and wanted a hug I got you." "Montrell Jackson knew that making our communities safer and juster are not conflicting ideas, 1179, 1213
And most officers will tell you they cant do one without the other, 1213, 1226
I believe we need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system not half measures but full measures with real follow-through, 1226, 1246
In America everyone should be respected by the law and have respect for the law." That starts with being honest, 1246, 1266
Being unafraid to face the facts, 1266, 1272
Face the fact that black men are far more likely to be stopped searched by police charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for doing the same thing, 1272, 1305
We need to fix a system where too many black parents are taken from their kids and imprisoned for minor offenses, 1305, 1326
We need to make sure our police officers are trained in de-escalating tense situations, 1326, 1340
We need to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and instead invest in education from early childhood through high school into higher education, 1340, 1362
And yes we have got to fight for common sense reforms to stop the epidemic of gun violence in our communities, 1362, 1383
"Gun violence is by far the leading cause of death for young black men more than the next nine causes combined, 1383, 1404
Weve got to make sure there are good jobs equality affordable housing in every zip code in America, 1404, 1422
We need to make investments in communities that have been left out and left behind, 1422, 1437
I am a strong supporter of Congressman Jim Clyburns plan to put 10 percent of our federal funds into 20 percent of the communities that have generational poverty for 30 years or more." "Now there are some out there who see this as a moment to command the flames of resentment and division, 1437, 1490
Who want to exploit peoples fears even though it means tearing our nation even further apart, 1490, 1506
They say that all of our problems will be solved simply by more law and order, 1506, 1522
As if the systemic racism plaguing our country doesnt exist, 1522, 1532
Now of course we need safe neighborhoods no one is against that, 1532, 1544
Of course we need communities that are free from the epidemic of gun violence of course we need that, 1544, 1563
But we also need justice and dignity and equality and we can have both, 1563, 1577
This is not an either-or question for America." "I want us to commit ourselves to this common vision, 1577, 1595
That is where I will build on the work that President Obama has done, 1595, 1609
And I will be sure that this is not just about a campaign or an election, 1609, 1625
This is much bigger than an election, 1625, 1632
These are issues Ive been fighting for since I was a young lawyer working for the Childrens Defense Fund, 1632, 1651
Going to South Carolina to try to get young teenagers 13 14-year-olds out of jails with adult offenders, 1651, 1669
I care deeply about this because its not just personal to so many of us its about the kind of country you want to be and the future we want for all of our children and grandchildren, 1669, 1706
I think about that every time I see my grandchildren or every time I see a bright energetic impressive young woman like Zianna, 1706, 1729
Come up here a minute would you?" I love your dress, 1729, 1740
You know God loves us all right? We are called to care for and cherish each other, 1740, 1757
Its not easy it is not, 1757, 1763
But that is our mission and that is what we are called to do not only as Christians but as Americans as human beings to understand and respect each other, 1763, 1793
To fight for each others children each others dignity each others opportunity as if they were our own, 1793, 1811
Now make no mistake this is not easy work, 1811, 1820
Youve been doing this since Adam and Eve came here, 1820, 1830
But it is righteous work, 1830, 1835
Protecting all of Gods children is Americas calling, 1835, 1843
Remember what scripture also tells us: Let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up, 1843, 1873
We will not grow weary and we will not lose heart, 1873, 1884
We will get up every single day have faith in one another and in our future and work for that better day for all of Gods people, 1884, 1911
Thank you." , 1911, 1913
