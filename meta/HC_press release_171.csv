"I wanted to talk to her about college affordability specifically in the context of HBCUs." Before she spoke Hillary met with a few students backstage, 0, 25
They discussed the high cost of college the crisis of student debt in America and the unique challenges facing students at historically black colleges and universities, 25, 51
"Heres what the students thought of their conversation." n n "She asked if any of us knew our interest rates for the loans we had taken out to come to school, 51, 82
And I told her that my combined rate is 13 percent because I had to take out $10000 dollars for just one semester, 82, 105
She was genuinely shocked—my interest rate was the highest shes ever heard, 105, 117
She was clearly genuinely upset, 117, 122
And she talked how her plans would fix things like this and better accommodate myself and other students who are dealing with student loans and debt in the future." Well shes had my vote since day one but I will admit that at the beginning of this campaign I was kind of like "Well is she genuine? Does she mean what she says? Is she going to follow through?" But after actually seeing her have a conversation with us and look us in the eyes and be genuine and feel for us I really believe in all of the ideas and everything that shes going to put into place, 122, 231
I feel like having met her one-on-one I want to go out of my way to support her and help get her ideas and messages out there so more people can understand why this woman should be the next president of the United States, 231, 275
"I would tell young voters who feel like their vote doesnt matter in this primary because we live in a red state that your vote absolutely does matter, 275, 303
And we have the power to change the politics of our state by voting for someone who is genuine and who is for us both as young people and as a state." n n I come from a line of HBCU graduates, 303, 345
My family all went to different HBCUs—FAMU Howard and some of the smaller ones like Vorhees and Benedict, 345, 363
And I wanted to continue the tradition, 363, 370
So I decided to come to Morris for my undergraduate education and then after I graduate I will do my masters at another HBCU Howard University, 370, 396
In the meeting when she came in what caught me was how she automatically started talking about student debt which was actually what I was going to ask her about—the student debt HBCU students deal with, 396, 432
I wanted to know what her thoughts were on it and if she was going to have any plans behind those thoughts, 432, 454
And basically she nailed everything about it right when I met her, 454, 466
So that threw me off because I was gonna ask her the question, 466, 479
"Id say Ive gone from supporting her because shes the most qualified to supporting her because I know how much she cares, 479, 501
I stood right in front of her and saw her address important issues genuinely and that she really does care, 501, 521
I feel more comfortable with voting for her yeah, 521, 530
So since Ive now had a personal conversation with her I know for sure how genuine she is." n n "Ive always liked campaigns, 530, 554
I have always been fascinated by the ways in which people get support and votes, 554, 569
But more recently I became interested in the governing side of things—the processes and work that go into that, 569, 588
I think thats actually what pushed me to major in political science because thats so interesting, 588, 604
Now I want to go into politics hopefully, 604, 612
Maybe." "A little surreal, 612, 616
I wanted to talk to her about college affordability specifically in the context of HBCUs—what kind of funding would she provide what kind of programs is she interested in creating, 616, 646
And she answered that question, 646, 651
Thoroughly, 651, 652
And just from being in a room with her and speaking to her .., 652, 666
I was already a fan of her but now Im an even bigger fan, 666, 680
Meeting her showed the true compassion that she has, 680, 689
She cares about us—we could all tell, 689, 696
That makes me feel great because that is my candidate and now I know how much she cares, 696, 714
Also I was surprised at how short she is, 714, 723
That was unexpected." "I would tell them that there is a serious candidate out there and she needs your support, 723, 743
This is a serious election, 743, 748
Too much is at stake for us to not participate, 748, 758
We cant go back, 758, 762
We need to continue to go forward, 762, 769
A vote for Hillary is a vote for forward progress." n n "I actually had every intention of going to The Citadel in Charleston, 769, 793
But my mother and grandmother convinced me to try Morris College, 793, 804
And ever since I came to Morris college I fell in love with the HBCU experience, 804, 820
I am proud to say that I am currently the junior class president and the university chaplain—and Im also running for first vice president next year, 820, 846
I wouldnt trade my experience at Morris for the world." "I like the fact that she is so down to earth, 846, 867
I really wasnt expecting that, 867, 872
You know how some people get so high up they kind of stop being a real person? Thats not her at all, 872, 894
She was very down to earth, 894, 900
I liked how she talked to us as human beings and I really enjoyed her company." "Meeting Hillary has motivated me to promote her even more, 900, 926
And I feel like shes really the candidate for our generation, 926, 937
Its time for us young people to treat ourselves not cheat ourselves, 937, 949
And we can do that by voting for and supporting Secretary Clinton because she understands what our needs are and has plans to address them." n n "I joined the HBCU community because I feel like HBCUs present us with more opportunities than other universities, 949, 994
Schools like Morris I think will do more to give us the tools to succeed in a way that other schools cant." "I actually wanted to speak to her about—its similar to the question my friend Karel was talking about—loan forgiveness, 994, 1035
I wanted to know her thoughts on how loan forgiveness would affect our state and federal economy, 1035, 1052
And she gave a long detailed answer which was really good." "I knew I would support her, 1052, 1069
But after getting to see her face-to-face you know she was courageous had leadership and she was full of energy, 1069, 1089
Im more secure with her being the president and with the ideas she stands for and her viewpoints, 1089, 1107
Out of all the candidates Ive heard speak her arguments werent fake, 1107, 1119
I know she believes them, 1119, 1124
She spoke from the heart, 1124, 1129
She was actually real." , 1129, 1133
