"We endorsed her because she endorsed us." In the middle of a live TV town hall from Columbia South Carolina Hillary Clinton took a moment to acknowledge five women in the audience, 0, 32
 She explained: "These five women have lost children to police actions and to random senseless gun violence and theres no doubt that in each case .., 32, 58
there is a racial component to it." Sybrina Fultons son Trayvon Martin was murdered by a man who viewed him as "dangerous" because of the color of his skin, 58, 87
"Geneva Reed-Veals daughter Sandra Bland was found hanging in a jail cell after she was pulled over for a routine traffic stop." "Maria Hamiltons son Dontre Hamilton was shot 14 times by a Milwaukee police officer." "Gwen Carrs son Eric Garner was choked to death by a police officer on the streets of New York." "Lucy McBaths son Jordan Davis was killed for playing his music too loudly." "Last November Hillary Clinton reached out to families who had lost a loved one and invited them to meet in Chicago, 87, 176
Many of the mothers werent sure what to expect, 176, 185
But what they saw and heard in the meeting stuck with them." "We poured out our hearts, 185, 202
Where no other candidate would listen to us Mrs, 202, 211
Clinton did" said Sybrina, 211, 215
In the months since theyve come together as the "Mothers of the Movement" turning their grief over unthinkable tragedy into a powerful call to action, 215, 240
Most recently they headed together to South Carolina, 240, 248
In between campaign stops Geneva Maria Lucy Sybrina and Gwen sat down to talk about their experiences on the trail, 248, 268
" We have been extremely busy but it was with a purpose, 268, 280
We went to a lot of churches and people showed their support by coming out, 280, 295
They couldve been doing anything but they decided to come listen to what we had to say and why were endorsing Hillary Clinton, 295, 318
We think were making a difference." " You talk about family I feel like were really family, 318, 335
And so this experience has brought us closer, 335, 343
Outside of endorsing Hillary outside of meeting at these functions this has really allowed me to see that we are anchored in our faith, 343, 367
And so its wonderful when youre in like company and you understand what your purpose is and youre able to move in that purpose—even beyond the pain."  Its a different kind of pain when you lose a child, 367, 405
These mothers can say "I know how you feel" and actually know how we feel how were still carrying the hurt and the pain around with us every single day, 405, 435
People dont see that often, 435, 440
Theres a lot of disappointment a lot of sadness a lot of hurt a lot of pain that we carry around on a daily basis and it makes it just that much lighter to know that Im going through this journey—and I got other mothers that are standing with me, 440, 490
I dont wish this on anybody but if I had to pick somebody this would be the group that I would pick to go through it with me, 490, 518
Women that when Im hurting and Im in pain can give me a word, 518, 532
Women that I can give a word to and they understand that, 532, 544
" Were deeply and morally grounded in faith, 544, 552
And that has a lot to do with the reasons why we have been allowed to go through these tragedies—because we understand dynamically that this is just not about our babies and God has a bigger purpose in what hes doing through us, 552, 595
And so were taking this to the streets, 595, 603
We know through faith that this is the way we change the course of whats happening in the country, 603, 622
Through faith well be able to make sure that Secretary Clinton becomes the next president of the United States, 622, 641
We will help usher in just a whole new kind of history, 641, 653
Were going to be a part of that—and our children have been the catalyst for that, 653, 669
For us its not just being here on the campaign trail, 669, 680
Its much deeper than that." " Were still hurting, 680, 689
And we know that our children deserved to have somebody fight for them, 689, 702
So were their voice, 702, 706
They cant fight for themselves, 706, 711
That was stripped away from them, 711, 717
So we want everybody to know ..., 717, 724
that we love our children." "And when we talk to the people we preach, 724, 738
They look at us and they tell us how strong we are—but we dont look like what weve been through, 738, 758
Weve been through a lot, 758, 763
Were going through a lot and we have a lot to go through!" Yes! "We know theres a lot of work to do, 763, 786
And were the ones to do it, 786, 793
And—as I promised my son—I will walk rally, 793, 801
I will stand up and hold up his name and the names of the nameless and the forgotten because we all hurt." "When this journey is over with this campaign we still have to go forward, 801, 837
We have to still continue to fight, 837, 844
And with us getting to know each other us learning each others strengths this will help us to go forward in our personal lives—as well as in a group environment."  We endorsed her because she endorsed us, 844, 881
 She came to us and she was concerned about our pain, 881, 892
 She showed us support and concern about what we were going through, 892, 904
No one stepped out of the political arena to do that, 904, 915
None of the candidates reached out to us, 915, 923
When they had their presidential debates no one spoke about Black Lives Matter, 923, 936
No one spoke about senseless gun violence and how many African Americans were being killed and how no one was being held accountable for it, 936, 961
She supported us before we even supported her, 961, 969
 She reached out to each one of us individually, 969, 978
 Twelve families were in that private meeting in Chicago, 978, 987
 I think we offer a sense of hope for them because in our communities theres a tremendous sense of hopelessness, 987, 1007
Were watching our babies being gunned down in the street our loved ones and family members being gunned down in the street, 1007, 1029
And then theyre like "Where do we turn? What do we do?" The laws arent supporting us, 1029, 1046
The criminal justice system isnt supporting us, 1046, 1053
Theres nobody supporting us, 1053, 1057
So for them to be able to see that we stood through the loss of our babies—and were still standing and moving forward and fighting on their behalf—I think that really gives them a sense of hope, 1057, 1094
" And I think our concern has been that everyone waits for the national election to go out and vote, 1094, 1114
But it starts at the primaries, 1114, 1120
You cant wait until the presidential election comes because then its too late, 1120, 1133
Were aiming to move people that may not have gone to the polls, 1133, 1146
Were trying to be proactive."  I think we were able to make people aware of how important it is to get out there and vote, 1146, 1171
And I think they see that, 1171, 1177
They get it!  If I could tell the world one thing I would tell them to never give up, 1177, 1196
Never give up! " Im hurt but Im not broke." " I would tell them that our children have gone on but were still here—and were still speaking for them!" " I would tell them that I am a mother thats going to fight for justice as long as theres breath in my body." " Id say that weve been a broken people but we still rise!"  Amen! , 1196, 1264
