Thank you all very very much! Thank you for that amazing welcome! "Thank you all for the great convention that weve had." "And Chelsea thank you, 0, 26
I am so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman youve become, 26, 42
Thank you for bringing Mark into our family and Charlotte and Aidan into the world." And Bill that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago .., 42, 71
it is still going strong, 71, 76
"You know that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy and hard times that tested us, 76, 96
And Ive even gotten a few words in along the way." On Tuesday night I was so happy to see that my "explainer in chief" is still on the job, 96, 126
"Im also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime." "To all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week thank you, 126, 166
What a remarkable week its been!" "We heard the man from Hope Bill Clinton and the man of hope Barack Obama, 166, 187
America is stronger because of President Obamas leadership, 187, 195
And Im better because of his friendship." We heard from our terrific vice president the one and only Joe Biden, 195, 215
"He spoke from his big heart about our partys commitment to working people as only he can do." And first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, 215, 245
And the president we elect is going to be their president too, 245, 257
And for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator, 257, 294
And he will make our whole country proud as our vice president, 294, 306
And I want to thank Bernie Sanders, 306, 313
Bernie your campaign inspired millions of Americans particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary, 313, 333
"Youve put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong." "And to all of your supporters here and around the country I want you to know Ive heard you, 333, 365
Your cause is our cause." "Our country needs your ideas energy and passion, 365, 378
That is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America, 378, 394
We wrote it together now lets go out and make it happen together!" "My friends weve come to Philadelphia the birthplace of our nation because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today, 394, 434
We all know the story but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all." When representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king, 434, 492
"The Revolution hung in the balance and somehow they began listening to each other compromising finding common purpose, 492, 510
And by the time they left Philadelphia they had begun to see themselves as one nation, 510, 526
Thats what made it possible to stand up to a king, 526, 537
That took courage they had courage, 537, 543
Our Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together." Now America is once again at a moment of reckoning, 543, 564
Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart, 564, 572
Bonds of trust and respect are fraying, 572, 579
And just as with our Founders there are no guarantees, 579, 589
It truly is up to us, 589, 595
We have to decide whether we will all work together so we can all rise together, 595, 611
"Our countrys motto is E Pluribus Unum out of many we are one, 611, 624
Will we stay true to that motto?" "Well we heard Donald Trumps answer last week at his convention, 624, 642
He wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other, 642, 657
Hes betting that the perils of todays world will blind us to its unlimited promise, 657, 672
Hes taken the Republican Party a long way from morning in America to midnight in America." He wants us to fear the future and fear each other, 672, 699
Well you know a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time: The only thing we have to fear is fear itself! "Now we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against, 699, 749
But we are not afraid, 749, 754
We will rise to the challenge just as we always have, 754, 765
We will not build a wall; instead we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one, 765, 787
And well build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy." We will not ban a religion, 787, 811
We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism, 811, 825
"Yet we know there is a lot to do, 825, 834
Too many people havent had a pay raise since the crash, 834, 845
Theres too much inequality too little social mobility too much paralysis in Washington." Too many threats at home and abroad, 845, 865
But just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges, 865, 882
We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world, 882, 893
"We have the most tolerant and generous young people weve ever had." We have the most powerful military the most innovative entrepreneurs the most enduring values freedom and equality justice and opportunity we should be so proud that those words are associated with us, 893, 937
I have to tell you as your secretary of state I went to 112 countries, 937, 952
When people hear those words they hear America! "So dont let anyone tell you that our country is weak, 952, 971
Were not, 971, 973
Dont let anyone tell you we dont have what it takes, 973, 984
We do, 984, 986
And most of all dont believe anyone who says I alone can fix it." "Yes those were actually Donald Trumps words in Cleveland, 986, 1009
And they should set off alarm bells for all of us, 1009, 1020
Really? I alone can fix it? Isnt he forgetting troops on the front lines police officers and firefighters who run toward danger doctors and nurses who care for us teachers who change lives entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe? Hes forgetting every last one of us." Americans dont say "I alone can fix it." We say "well fix it together!" And remember remember our Founders fought a Revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power, 1020, 1123
240 years later we still put our faith in each other, 1123, 1134
Look at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers, 1134, 1148
Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force maybe even join them, 1148, 1163
And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days, 1163, 1178
"Thats how Americans answer when the call for help goes out." Twenty years ago I wrote a book called "It Takes a Village." And a lot of people looked at the title and asked what the heck do you mean by that? This is what I mean, 1178, 1225
None of us can raise a family build a business heal a community or lift a country totally alone, 1225, 1244
America needs every one of us to lend our energy our talents our ambition to making our nation better and stronger, 1244, 1265
I believe that with all my heart, 1265, 1272
Thats why "stronger together" is not just a lesson from our history its not just a slogan for our campaign its a guiding principle for the country weve always been and the future were going to build a country where the economy works for everyone not just those at the top, 1272, 1323
Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school no matter what ZIP code you live in, 1323, 1346
A country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach where families are strong communities are safe and yes where love trumps hate, 1346, 1373
"Thats the country were fighting for, 1373, 1379
Thats the future were working toward, 1379, 1385
And so my friends it is with humility determination and boundless confidence in Americas promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States!" "Now sometimes—sometimes—the people at this podium are new to the national stage, 1385, 1423
As you know Im not one of those people, 1423, 1432
Ive been your first lady served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York then I represented all of you as secretary of state." "But my job titles only tell you what Ive done, 1432, 1470
They dont tell you why, 1470, 1475
The truth is through all these years of public service the service part has always come easier to me than the public part." "I get it that some people just dont know what to make of me." "So let me tell you, 1475, 1517
The family Im from well no one had their name on big buildings, 1517, 1530
My family were builders of a different kind builders in the way most American families are, 1530, 1546
They used whatever tools they had whatever God gave them and whatever life in America provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids." My grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years, 1546, 1584
Because he believed that if he gave everything he had his children would have a better life than he did, 1584, 1604
And he was right, 1604, 1608
My dad Hugh made it to college he played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor, 1608, 1629
When the war was over he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies, 1629, 1644
I remember watching him stand for hours over silkscreens, 1644, 1653
He wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had and he did, 1653, 1668
My mother Dorothy was abandoned by her parents as a young girl, 1668, 1680
She ended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid, 1680, 1692
She was saved by the kindness of others, 1692, 1700
Her first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year, 1700, 1720
The lessons she passed on to me years later stuck with me, 1720, 1732
No one gets through life alone, 1732, 1738
We have to look out for each other and lift each other up, 1738, 1751
And she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can, 1751, 1787
"So I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund going door-to- door in New Bedford Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school, 1787, 1819
I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house, 1819, 1836
She told me how badly she wanted to go to school, 1836, 1847
It just didnt seem possible in those days, 1847, 1855
And I couldnt stop thinking of my mother and what shed gone through as a child." It became clear to me that simply caring is not enough, 1855, 1882
To drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws, 1882, 1894
You need both understanding and action, 1894, 1900
"So we gathered facts we built a coalition and our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities, 1900, 1924
Its a big idea isnt it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school." But how? How do you make an idea like that real? You do it step by step year by year sometimes even door by door, 1924, 1967
My heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage, 1967, 1984
"Because we changed our law to make sure she got an education, 1984, 1996
So its true, 1996, 1999
I sweat the details of policy whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint Michigan the number of mental health facilities in Iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs." "Because its not just a detail if its your kid if its your family, 1999, 2050
Its a big deal, 2050, 2054
And it should be a big deal to you president too." "After the four days of this convention youve seen some of the people who have inspired me people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine people like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning, 2054, 2102
They told their stories Tuesday night." "I first met Ryan as a 7-year old, 2102, 2116
He was wearing a full-body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because I leaned over to lift him up, 2116, 2136
Children like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Childrens Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country." Lauren Manning who stood here with such grace and power was gravely injured on 9/11, 2136, 2190
It was the thought of her and Debbie St, 2190, 2199
John who you saw in the movie and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero, 2199, 2248
I was thinking of Lauren Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice, 2248, 2282
"And in this campaign Ive met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change, 2282, 2299
And with your help I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House." "And you heard from Republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign, 2299, 2330
Well I will be a president for Democrats Republicans independents for the struggling the striving the successful for all those who vote for me and for those who dont, 2330, 2359
For all Americans together!" "Tonight weve reached a milestone in our nations march toward a more perfect union, 2359, 2377
The first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president!" "Standing here as my mothers daughter and my daughters mother Im so happy this day has come, 2377, 2407
Im happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between, 2407, 2418
Im happy for boys and men, 2418, 2424
Because when any barrier falls in America it clears the way for everyone." "After all when there are no ceilings the skys the limit!" "So lets keep going, 2424, 2452
Lets keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have!" But even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead, 2452, 2495
"Lets begin with what were going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead." "Now I dont think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes." Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office, 2495, 2552
Nearly 15 million new private sector jobs 20 million more Americans with health insurance and an auto industry that just had its best year ever, 2552, 2577
"Now thats real progress but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo not by a long shot, 2577, 2597
Were still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery." "Ive gone around the country talking to working families and Ive heard from many who feel like the economy sure isnt working for them, 2597, 2640
Some of you are frustrated even furious, 2640, 2647
And you know what? Youre right, 2647, 2653
Its not yet working the way it should, 2653, 2661
Americans are willing to work and work hard but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them period." Democrats we are the party of working people, 2661, 2703
"But we havent done a good enough job showing we get what youre going through and were going to do something to help, 2703, 2726
So tonight I want to tell you how we will empower Americans to live better lives." My primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States, 2726, 2766
From my first day in office to my last especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind from our inner cities to our small towns from Indian country to coal country from communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures, 2766, 2815
"And heres what I believe, 2815, 2820
I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives, 2820, 2829
I believe our economy isnt working the way it should because our democracy isnt working the way it should." "Thats why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights not restrict them." And if necessary we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United! "I believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return, 2829, 2903
Many of them are but too many arent, 2903, 2911
Its wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other." And I believe Wall Street can never ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again, 2911, 2943
And I believe in science! I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean-energy jobs, 2943, 2968
I believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out, 2968, 2994
"Comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together, 2994, 3005
And its the right thing to do." So whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign, 3005, 3036
If you believe that companies should share profits not pad executive bonuses join us! If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty join us! If you believe that every man woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care join us! If you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to China that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and home-grown manufacturers then join us! "If you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a womans right to make her own health care decisions then join us!" And yes yes if you believe that your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay join us! "Thats how were going to make sure this economy works for everyone not just those at the top." "Now you didnt hear any of this did you from Donald Trump at his convention? He spoke for 70-odd minutes—and I do mean odd—and he offered zero solutions, 3036, 3218
But we already know he doesnt believe these things, 3218, 3227
No wonder he doesnt like talking about his plans, 3227, 3236
You might have noticed I love talking about mine." "In my first 100 days we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good-paying jobs since World War II, 3236, 3269
Jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small business and infrastructure, 3269, 3281
If we invest in infrastructure now well not only create jobs today but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future, 3281, 3303
And we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs." Bernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all, 3303, 3339
We will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt, 3339, 3351
"Its just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts and students and families cant refinance their debts." "And something we dont say often enough sure college is crucial but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job." We will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it, 3351, 3414
"We will give small businesses like my dads a boost make it easier to get credit, 3414, 3430
Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks, 3430, 3441
In America if you can dream it you should be able to build it." And we will help you balance family and work, 3441, 3464
And you know what? If fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card then deal me in! "Now heres the other thing." "Now were not only going to make all of these investments were going to pay for every single one of them, 3464, 3513
And heres how: Wall Street corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes." "This is not because we resent success, 3513, 3540
But when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent thats where the money is, 3540, 3561
And we are going to follow the money." "And if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas well make them pay us back and well put that money to work where it belongs creating jobs here at home." Now I imagine that some of you are sitting at home thinking well that all sounds pretty good but how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington? "Well look at my record, 3561, 3644
Ive worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people, 3644, 3664
And if you give me the chance thats exactly what Ill do as president." "But then I also imagine people are thinking out there but Trump hes a businessman he must know something about the economy." "Well lets take a closer look shall we? In Atlantic City 60 miles from here you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills." "Now remember what the president said last night: Dont boo; vote!" "But think of this, 3664, 3748
People who did the work and needed the money not because he couldnt pay them but because he wouldnt pay them, 3748, 3769
He just stiffed them, 3769, 3773
And you know that sales pitch hes making to be president put your faith in him and youll win big? Thats the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses, 3773, 3805
Then Trump walked away and left working people holding the bag." He also talks a big game about putting America first, 3805, 3826
Well please explain what part of "America first" leads him to make Trump ties in China not Colorado Trump suits in Mexico not Michigan Trump furniture in Turkey not Ohio Trump picture frames in India not Wisconsin? Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again, 3826, 3873
Well he could start by actually making things in America again, 3873, 3884
Now the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security, 3884, 3903
"You know anyone—anyone—reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face from Baghdad to Kabul to Nice and Paris and Brussels from San Bernardino to Orlando, 3903, 3931
Were dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated." "So its no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance looking for steady leadership wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home." "Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority, 3931, 3998
Im proud that weve put a lid on Irans nuclear program without firing a single shot." "Now we have to enforce it, 3998, 4020
And we must keep supporting Israels security." "Im proud that we shaped a global climate agreement, 4020, 4036
Now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments including ourselves." "And Im proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face including from Russia." "Ive laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS, 4036, 4075
We will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground, 4075, 4093
We will surge our intelligence so we detect and prevent attacks before they happen, 4093, 4107
We will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country." "It wont be easy or quick but make no mistake we will prevail." Now Donald Trump Donald Trump says and this is a quote "I know more about ISIS than the generals do." No Donald you dont, 4107, 4159
He thinks he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster, 4159, 4176
"Well Ive had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee and I know how wrong he is, 4176, 4209
Our military is a national treasure, 4209, 4215
We entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces decisions about war and peace life and death, 4215, 4237
A president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country...including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence both Marines." "So just ask yourself do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign, 4237, 4297
He loses his cool at the slightest provocation when hes gotten a tough question from a reporter when hes challenged in a debate when he sees a protester at a rally, 4297, 4328
Imagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis." A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons! "I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis, 4328, 4376
She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men the ones moved by fear and pride." "Americas strength doesnt come from lashing out, 4376, 4421
It relies on smarts judgment cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power, 4421, 4436
And thats the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be." "And if were serious about keeping our country safe we also cant afford to have a president whos in the pocket of the gun lobby." "Im not here to repeal the Second Amendment, 4436, 4481
Im not here to take away your guns, 4481, 4489
I just dont want you to be shot by someone who shouldnt have a gun in the first place." We will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals terrorists and all others who would do us harm, 4489, 4539
You know for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch, 4539, 4560
But I ask you how can we just stand by and do nothing? You heard you saw family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage, 4560, 4588
You heard you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals, 4588, 4609
"I refuse to believe we cant find common ground here, 4609, 4619
We have to heal the divides in our country not just on guns but on race immigration and more." "And that starts with listening listening to each other trying as best we can to walk in each others shoes, 4619, 4658
So lets put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable!" "Lets put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses good-bye every day heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job, 4658, 4716
We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve." "And we will defend all our rights civil rights human rights and voting rights womens rights and workers rights LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities." "And we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from, 4716, 4780
You know for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trumps comments excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show." "They thought he couldnt possibly mean all the horrible things he says, 4780, 4819
Like when he called women pigs or said that an American judge couldnt be fair because of his Mexican heritage or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war like John McCain a hero and a patriot who deserves our respect." "Now at first at first I admit I couldnt he meant it either, 4819, 4880
It was just too hard to fathom that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things could be like that, 4880, 4903
But heres the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump this is it." "And in the end it comes down to what Donald Trump doesnt get: America is great because America is good!" "So enough with the bigotry and the bombast, 4903, 4945
Donald Trumps not offering real change hes offering empty promises, 4945, 4955
And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country to keep you safe to get you good jobs to get your kids the opportunities they deserve." "The choice is clear my friends, 4955, 4995
Every generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer fairer and stronger, 4995, 5010
None of us ever have or can do it alone, 5010, 5020
I know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart it can be hard to imagine how well ever pull together, 5020, 5046
But Im here to tell you tonight progress is possible, 5046, 5056
I know because Ive seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up." "And I know it from my own life, 5056, 5086
More than a few times Ive had to pick myself up and get back in the game." Like so much else in my life I got this from my mother too, 5086, 5117
She never let me back down from any challenge, 5117, 5126
When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully she literally blocked the door go back out there she said, 5126, 5146
And she was right, 5146, 5150
You have to stand up to bullies, 5150, 5157
You have to keep working to make things better even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce, 5157, 5177
"We lost our mother a few years ago but I miss her every day, 5177, 5191
And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working keep fighting for right no matter what, 5191, 5209
Thats what we need to do together as a nation." And though we may not live to see the glory as the song from the musical "Hamilton" goes let us gladly join the fight let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see, 5209, 5258
Thats why were here not just in this hall but on this earth, 5258, 5271
The Founders showed us that and so have many others since, 5271, 5282
They were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow, 5282, 5302
That is the story of America, 5302, 5308
And we begin a new chapter tonight, 5308, 5315
"Yes the world is watching what we do, 5315, 5323
Yes Americas destiny is ours to choose, 5323, 5330
So lets be stronger together my fellow Americans!" "Lets look to the future with courage and confidence, 5330, 5347
Lets build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country, 5347, 5360
And when we do America will be greater than ever!" Thank you and may God bless you and the United States of America! , 5360, 5383
