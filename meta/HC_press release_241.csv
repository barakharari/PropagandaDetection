Including an extremely astute take on flying, 0, 7
Hillary Clinton recently sat down for a candid conversation about the 2016 election with journalist Glenn Thrush on POLITICOs "Off Message" podcast, 7, 29
You can listen to the whole hourlong conversation  "—but if youre short on time check out these five key takeaways." Thrush shared a memory from the press plane during Hillarys 2008 campaign: "I was not a happy flier and nothing ever seemed to bother you" he said, 29, 76
"I mean we were in some really hairy situations and you would sleep your way through it." "That is the answer to everything" Hillary responded, 76, 101
"When youre facing a difficult issue that you absolutely cannot do anything about—in this case I cant fly the plane I cant change the weather—falling asleep youll either wake up and things will be fine or you wont, 101, 139
.., 139, 140
Its been my observation that so many people worry about things that they are either ruminating over the past which doesnt help you get the focus and energy you need to get up every day and go forward or theyre worrying about stuff that they have absolutely no control over, 140, 190
So I have developed that kind of philosophy in my life over the years." Hillary admits that campaigning is hard—and it didnt come naturally to her, 190, 216
Even something as seemingly simple as using the pronoun "I" was an adjustment, 216, 229
"Im very comfortable saying you know ?he ?she ?we" Hillary said, 229, 240
"But when I had to stand up in front of people and basically say ?Im asking for your vote Im telling you what I want to do that took years, 240, 270
It absolutely took years." But Hillary says while asking for a job is a challenge she thrives on the job when she gets it, 270, 294
"I am someone who loves doing the job that I have, 294, 305
I would love having the job of president because I know how to do it, 305, 320
I know what the country needs, 320, 326
But the campaigning part is hard for me, 326, 334
I think Ive gotten better." "I really believe part of what this campaign has to do is rebuild peoples faith in our national mission" Hillary said, 334, 360
"How do we get the economy to work? How do we get the government to work? How do we get our political system to work? And I feel strongly that I owe people a clear set of ideas and I want to lay those out, 360, 405
"And I know that sometimes I get criticized for ?Oh my gosh there she goes with another plan, 405, 423
You know ?Forget the plan just you know do the rhetorical flourish, 423, 435
I really believe that when this is all over—and I will have won hopefully—in large measure it will be because I came out and told people ?Heres what I want to do heres how I think I can do it here are the results I believe I can get and I want you to hold me accountable for it, 435, 494
I think thats what politics should be about so Im very comfortable doing that." "Hillarys right—she does have a lot of plans, 494, 516
Explore them " Speaking about "mean-spirited" Republican candidates in this election Hillary reflected: "We can have differences, 516, 533
Look Im well-aware that its a contact sport, 533, 541
I understand that, 541, 544
But when it gets right down to it youve got to offer Americans your credentials because its a huge interviewing and hiring process, 544, 567
And people have to decide ?What do I know about this person? Is this the person I want in the Oval Office? Is this the person I want to be both president and Commander-in-Chief? And that requires a level of dialogue and debate that is civil that does have a purpose to it other than just you know making a point." "I dont think any right that we have is less important than any other issue" Hillary said, 567, 645
"You know I have said repeatedly ?I am going to attack income inequality and I think I have a pretty good plan to do so, 645, 670
I dont just tell you what Im against, 670, 678
I tell you what Im for and how I would do it, 678, 690
"But there are other forms of inequality, 690, 697
There is desperate education inequality in America and I think every kid deserves a good teacher and a good school regardless of the ZIP code that he or she lives in, 697, 728
Racial inequality sexual orientation inequality gender inequality, 728, 735
So when somebody says ?Yeah yeah its important but lets talk about the really important issues, 735, 751
Dont let us get distracted from hearing the same thing weve heard now over and over again about income inequality that bothers me and I did speak out about it." , 751, 781
