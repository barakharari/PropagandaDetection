"There is a dynamic going on in the Republican Party that is outside of my radar screen." "Oh gosh, 0, 19
I canvassed for John F, 19, 24
Kennedy before I was old enough to vote for him, 24, 34
That was when the voting age was 21, 34, 42
Then in 1972 I did a concert for McGovern, 42, 51
And in 1984 I got involved with the Gary Hart campaign in New Hampshire, 51, 65
I still have some really good friends from that—Senator Jeanne Shaheen ran his campaign, 65, 79
I was involved in the first President Clinton campaign—may there be a second President Clinton!—and then I got involved in John Kerrys campaign, 79, 102
So Ive been doing this for a while." "I have an issue! Im a New Yorker by birth and by heart, 102, 123
But I live in Idaho which also has my heart, 123, 133
Its the landscape and the people and just everything, 133, 142
And I became involved with an environmental project that would protect the Northern Rockies ecosystem, 142, 157
It has what are called wildlife corridors where birds can migrate and so on, 157, 171
Right now theyre being cut down by the timber industry and these forests are all going away, 171, 188
Its contributing to climate change and that affects people everywhere, 188, 198
Ive been involved in that for the last 25 years." "I support Hillary because she will support the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and make sure it can continue to do the work that it was intended to do, 198, 236
Thats a very big issue." "The other thing is the fact that she understands the big picture, 236, 253
She doesnt just see things as this issue isolated or that issue isolated, 253, 266
For example she sees the intersection between climate change the environment and the economy, 266, 280
She understands that creating jobs in renewable energy in the United States would not only help combat climate change it would create jobs—and those jobs would not be outsourceable, 280, 309
Her understanding of the big picture is the single greatest advantage she has over any candidate running." When she represented New York she represented everyone in New York, 309, 337
If she is fortunate enough to be elected president—if we are fortunate enough to have her be elected—she will represent everyone in America, 337, 360
"I will say that there is a dynamic going on in the Republican Party that is outside of my radar screen, 360, 381
I dont understand how people can be campaigning about things that are so low on the spectrum of intellect of understanding of bringing people together of seeing the big picture of what would really be good for the world." Hillary understands that we are interconnected with the rest of the world so anything you do affects people worldwide, 381, 439
And certainly she would represent the people of the United States first and foremost but she is also thinking about how to integrate us into the rest of the world in a manner that acknowledges our commonality rather than our differences, 439, 480
"Of course there are many countries that are not as easily reasoned with just as there are many Republican candidates for president that are not as easily reasoned with, 480, 509
But I think its so important to have a leader for our country who gets the need for inclusivity and working together, 509, 531
I think people who think about limited issues who dont see the interconnectedness the way she does are missing something crucial." As for the people who support Bernie Sanders: I get them, 531, 563
When I have discussions with friends who are Bernie supporters its always respectful, 563, 576
We really do want the same things, 576, 583
But they say "I think Bernie is the way to get there." And I say "Wheres his plan?" I have no problem with the idea of free college but I dont see how that happens, 583, 618
I do have a problem however with starting all over on universal health care—and I wish we had universal health care! But I think we can get to it by building on Obamacare and I love that thats Hillarys approach, 618, 658
She wrote a book called  , 658, 663
Boy if I were in her position I would find her choices that she had to deal with very hard, 663, 683
I come from an extremely liberal progressive point of view, 683, 693
I was that way when I was young—and I still am that way, 693, 706
I think Hillary is in the same place, 706, 714
We are called upon to make hard choices all the time, 714, 725
We hear from people quote: "I dont know if shes trustworthy." Let me answer that by saying that her opponents and people who are scared of her politically have spent millions of dollars throwing mud at her, 725, 762
They do that because they hope some of it will stick, 762, 773
If you think shes untrustworthy some of it has stuck! And Im here to tell you that I know her and I trust her to lead our country to the best possible place it can be, 773, 809
To help you achieve your dreams, 809, 815
To help us achieve our goals, 815, 821
To make a better world for my children and grandchildren and your grandchildren if youre reading this, 821, 838
