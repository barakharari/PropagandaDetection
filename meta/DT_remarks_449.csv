Thank you Ohio, 0, 3
It is so great to be in the great city of Canton, 3, 15
"We just got new polls from Bloomberg and CNN, 15, 24
Were up five points in Ohio and the LA Times poll has us up 5 points nationwide." "The people of the United States are ready for change, 24, 51
Theyre ready to discard a failed political establishment that disdains disrespects and looks down on hardworking people." This election is about a choice between the control of an arrogant ruling class in Washington D.C, 51, 85
versus the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens, 85, 93
For years our leaders have looked out only for themselves, 93, 103
"There is no greater example of this in our country than Flint Michigan, 103, 116
The city of Flint was once known as Buick City, 116, 126
More than 80000 workers were employed by GM in 1970 – today its less than 8000, 126, 142
Forty percent of the citys residents are living in poverty, 142, 152
Violent crime is among the nations highest." Today I went to Flint Michigan to address the water crisis, 152, 170
The water crisis in Flint demonstrates failure at every single level of government, 170, 183
"Its tragic and its heartbreaking and it should never happen in the United States of America." This is the catastrophe that happens when we build up other countries instead of our own, 183, 215
"It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldnt drink the water in Mexico, 215, 232
Now the cars are made in Mexico and you cant drink the water in Flint." We are going to turn this around, 232, 254
We are going to bring our jobs back and protect our people, 254, 266
Driving through the city you see the shuttered homes and businesses the dilapidated infrastructure, 266, 280
This is what our politicians have done to this city this is what our politicians have done to America, 280, 299
But nowhere has the pain been worse than our inner cities, 299, 310
Democratic politicians have ran our inner cities for 50 60 70 years, 310, 322
Their policies have produced massive poverty joblessness and failing schools, 322, 332
"Theyve trapped Americans in suffering for years and Im running to offer a better future, 332, 347
Lower crime better schools more jobs – safety security opportunity." "Now I understand there are going to be some people in these communities who arent planning on voting for me right now, 347, 379
I will campaign hard for their votes – we cant stay the course our country is on, 379, 396
If you keep voting for the same people youll keep getting the same results." I am willing to campaign anywhere, 396, 416
I am willing to go anywhere visit anywhere even if some voters openly oppose me in a community I will go there and ask them for their support, 416, 444
"Hillary Clinton calls people who arent supporting her deplorable and irredeemable, 444, 455
I call people who arent supporting me American citizens who are entitled to the same respect as anyone else – and I will not stop campaigning for every last American vote in every last American community right up until November 8th." I will take my message to communities that are 99% Democrat or that have voted Democrat for generations, 455, 514
I am running to be President for all Americans to represent all Americans and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and poverty and violence, 514, 539
The economic policies of Hillary Clinton – on trade on the economy on immigration – have devastated the inner cities of America, 539, 561
Her policies are the problem; we are offering the solution, 561, 571
Hillary Clinton believes in globalism – taking jobs from Flint and moving them to other countries, 571, 587
I am not running to be President of the world – I am running to be President of the United States, 587, 608
I am running to bring hope to Flint to Canton and to every party of this country, 608, 625
"If we dont break free from our partisan boxes then nothing will ever change – its time to vote for America and America First." "Hillary Clintons refugee plans will cost $400 billion dollars in the long-term, 625, 661
Thats enough money to rebuild the entire water infrastructure of the United States." President Obama just announced a 30% increase to refugee admissions bringing the total to 110000 refugees in just one single year, 661, 695
Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees we need to rebuild our inner cities and take care of Americans, 695, 718
Our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life, 718, 731
You are cops and soldiers; mechanics and accountants; young and the old; black white and Latino, 731, 747
You are moms and dads children and grandparents you are from cities small and large and in-between, 747, 764
But above everything else you are all Americans, 764, 772
"Hillary Clintons attacks on you display the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State hide and delete her emails destroy her phones with a hammer put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to Congress and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation." Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress, 772, 846
There is no greater threat to Democracy than when a public official puts their office up for sale, 846, 864
Look at what she did with Russian Uranium or with UBS bank or with the contracts in Haiti, 864, 882
"Hillary Clintons record as Secretary of State is one of historic failure, 882, 894
Just look at what she did to the Middle East – in Iraq in Syria in Libya, 894, 911
Not to mention her failures in Russia China and North Korea." One failure after another – all while raising millions and millions from her friends in Wall Street, 911, 939
The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced only destruction overseas and poverty at home, 939, 953
1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force, 953, 968
Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009, 968, 979
And the national debt has doubled, 979, 985
I am running to reverse these policies and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans, 985, 1002
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs jobs jobs, 1002, 1015
That begins with a new America-First trade policy, 1015, 1023
Hillary Clintons bad judgement was seen in her support for Bill Clintons NAFTA her support for Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization and her support for the TPP – she called it the "Gold Standard." Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and 1 in 4 since China entered the WTO, 1023, 1079
Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars, 1079, 1093
I will renegotiate NAFTA I will defend your jobs and I will bring back vehicle production to the United States of America, 1093, 1115
"Americas trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100000 manufacturing jobs last year, 1115, 1136
Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved – which Hillary Clinton 100% would do if she ever got the chance." "We wont let that happen, 1136, 1167
But you have to get out and vote." My first day in office I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years, 1167, 1198
All needless job-killing regulations will be cancelled, 1198, 1205
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in, 1205, 1213
We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy, 1213, 1223
Also on my first day I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, 1223, 1246
I will fight for you against the special interests against the corrupt politicians and against the powerful insiders, 1246, 1264
Let me be your champion, 1264, 1269
"In all things its time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other." Yesterday I rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality childcare for their children, 1269, 1306
On policy after policy we are going to bring opportunity and prosperity to all Americans, 1306, 1321
"I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life; Im going to repeal and replace Obamacare; Im going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; Im going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; Im going to save your 2nd amendment NRA endorsement; Im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall Mexico will pay; and Im going to so importantly renegotiate your horrible trade deals especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world and a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first." And Apple and our other major companies will start making their iPhones computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China and all over the world, 1321, 1496
"We dont make our products anymore in the United States but we will again – like never before." We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1496, 1526
We will rebuild our water infrastructure and our EPA will abandon political agendas and focus on its core mission: clean air and safe water, 1526, 1550
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1550, 1570
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1570, 1579
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy mined from American sources will power this nation, 1579, 1597
American workers will be hired to do the job, 1597, 1606
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 1606, 1618
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People, 1618, 1642
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1642, 1663
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 1663, 1685
Jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores, 1685, 1701
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 1701, 1714
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1714, 1720
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1720, 1726
And Will Make America Great Again, 1726, 1732
Thank you and God Bless! , 1732, 1737
