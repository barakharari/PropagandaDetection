"Hello Kent State! And Happy Halloween everybody! Its great to be back in Ohio – even if even if the World Series is making life very stressful for Cubs fans everywhere.n" I want to thank Bruce Blair for that introduction and for his service to our nation, 0, 47
I think every American should hear your story over the next 8 days before they vote, 47, 63
I also want to thank everyone who was part of the pre-program, 63, 75
In particular let me thank Senator Sherrod Brown such a great senator my dear friend and great congressman Tim Ryan State Representative John Boccieri State Representative Kathleen Clyde and let me thank the Kent Clarks the acapella group that sang during the pre-program!n "My friends we are about to enter the final week of this election so I wanted to come back to Ohio one of the most competitive and consequential battlegrounds in the country to talk about whats at stake in this election, 75, 159
But let me start with this, 159, 165
Im sure a lot of you may be asking what this new email story is about and why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election with no evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go, 165, 206
Thats a good question!n" "And first of all for those of you who are concerned about my using personal email I understand and as Ive said Im not making excuses, 206, 236
I said it was a mistake and I regret it and now they apparently want to look at emails of one of my staffers and by all means they should look at them, 236, 269
And I am sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the last year, 269, 291
There is no case here, 291, 296
And they said it wasnt even a close call and I think most people have decided a long time ago what they think about all of this.n" "Now what people are focused on is choosing the next President and Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America, 296, 342
And did any of you see the debates? Well I think it was important because I had a chance to talk about my 30 years of public service and my plans for our country, 342, 376
And then people could weigh that against what my opponent has done and said, 376, 390
I am running against a man who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons, 390, 407
He actually said Then why are we making them? And he wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, 407, 425
Japan South Korea even Saudi Arabia, 425, 431
Imagine nuclear weapons smack in the middle of the Middle East.n" "And if youre telling yourself hell surround himself with smart people wholl stop these crazy ideas remember this: When he asked who he consults on foreign policy Donald Trump said he didnt need to consult because he said and I quote I have a very good brain, 431, 489
He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do, 489, 500
No he does not, 500, 504
And of course the people Donald Trump has had around him include two men whose activities are reportedly being investigated for their ties to Russia -- Vladimir Putin and Putins allies.n" "So in these last days lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election and the consequences for your future, 504, 557
I started saying last June I believe that Donald Trump has proven himself temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief, 557, 580
And Ive got to tell you I did not take any pleasure in saying that, 580, 595
I have known I have known for years now people who ran for President Republicans and Democrats, 595, 612
And I had my differences with Republicans and even with Democrats but I never doubted their fitness to serve, 612, 631
Donald Trump is different, 631, 635
Thats as serious as it gets.n" So today I want to talk about our national security, 635, 651
Because when the election is over and people wake up on November 9th we will have picked the person who will carry the responsibility for all these weighty decisions, 651, 680
And that should really convince anyone how high the stakes really are in this election, 680, 695
And I just want to focus on three of the most crucial questions facing the next President: Can you be trusted to command our nuclear arsenal and make literally life and death decisions about war and peace? How do you handle a crisis? And do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries?n "Well start with nuclear weapons, 695, 755
Now I know there are some who will say that any discussion of this topic could be fear-mongering but I dont think so and in part of what you just heard from Bruce Blair, 755, 789
When dozens of retired nuclear launch officers publicly state that Donald Trump should and I quote not have his finger on the button then this is a topic that cant be avoided, 789, 821
And as Ive said Donald has repeatedly suggested that more countries should have nuclear weapons, 821, 836
He must not realize or care that the more nuclear material there is in the world the more likely terrorists are to get their hands on it -- or that someone will miscalculate and start a war that cant be stopped, 836, 877
And when a few more countries go nuclear their neighbors will feel pressure to do so as well.n" "One of the reasons I worked so hard to impose sanctions on Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table was so we would not have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East and I am proud that we put a lid on Irans nuclear weapons program, 877, 946
But even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother Donald Trump, 946, 961
Good luck enjoy yourselves folks was what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia.n" I wonder if he knows that a single nuclear warhead can kill millions of people, 961, 994
These are weapons today far more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.n "To talk so casually so cavalierly about mass annihilation is truly appalling, 994, 1025
President Ronald Reagan once said -- and he worked hard for arms control and I admired what he did working with the Soviet Union -- and he once said he feared and this is a quote from President Reagan some fool or some maniac or some accident triggering the kind of war that is the end of the line for all of us, 1025, 1088
That has been the fear and the commitment of Democratic and Republican presidents since the dawn of the Atomic Age.n" "So what would he think about Donald Trump who says he wants to be and I quote unpredictable about using the most powerful weapons ever produced? And heres the thing with nuclear weapons – as Bruce told you when the President gives the order thats it, 1088, 1154
Theres no veto for Congress no veto by the Joint Chiefs, 1154, 1165
The officers in the silos have no choice but to fire, 1165, 1176
And that can take as little as four minutes, 1176, 1185
Thats why all those retired launch officers stepped forward and said Donald Trump should never be put in charge of our nuclear arsenal.n" "Earlier you heard from one of them Bruce Blair and his story is worth remembering, 1185, 1223
In 1973 Bruce was a young military officer working in an underground bunker in Montana, 1223, 1238
His job was to launch as many as 50 nuclear weapons if the President ever gave the order, 1238, 1256
Then one night in October as the United States and the Soviet Union squared off over an escalating conflict in the Middle East the emergency message he had trained for arrived: prepare for nuclear war, 1256, 1291
Like other American officers in bunkers and submarines and bombers around the world Bruce and his colleagues started the process because that was their duty, 1291, 1316
They unlocked the safe took out the launch codes and the keys and then strapped into their chairs to brace for the shockwaves that would come if a Russian warhead detonated above them, 1316, 1349
Then they waited for the final order from the President, 1349, 1359
Thankfully it never came, 1359, 1363
But when Bruce looks at Donald Trump and sees his hair-trigger temper and he thinks about what it felt like inside that bunker that night, 1363, 1388
As Ive said many times a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.n" "And that brings me to the second question I think voters should pose to both candidates: How do you handle a crisis? Weve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation, 1388, 1448
When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter, 1448, 1457
When hes challenged in a debate, 1457, 1463
When he sees a protestor at a rally, 1463, 1471
When hes confronted with his own words, 1471, 1478
So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis, 1478, 1489
Imagine his advisors afraid to tell him what he doesnt want to hear racing against his legendarily short attention span to lay out life-and-death choices too complex to be reduced to a single tweet, 1489, 1523
And then imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin.n" "Now thankfully hes never been in a position where he had to help make life-and-death decisions for our country, 1523, 1559
But there was one national crisis where we did get a good look at how Donald Trump handles himself, 1559, 1578
Donald is a New Yorker and his finest moment in this campaign was when he defended New York against Ted Cruzs attacks in a debate, 1578, 1603
And then he invoked the days after 9/11 when New Yorkers really came together and took care of each other, 1603, 1623
And I couldnt agree more, 1623, 1628
Thats why it was so upsetting to learn what Donald was actually doing on 9/11, 1628, 1643
After the world watched with horror as the Twin Towers fell he called in to a New York TV station, 1643, 1663
And even on that horrible day when thousands of people lost their lives he couldnt stop himself from pointing out that now because the towers had fallen a building he owned was now the tallest in Lower Manhattan, 1663, 1701
What kind of a person brags at a moment like that? Ill tell you: someone who should never set foot in the Oval Office and serve as Commander in Chief.n" "For me I take this very personally my friends, 1701, 1740
Because I was one of New Yorks senators along with Chuck Schumer on 9/11, 1740, 1754
He and I were on the ground the very next day meeting with the Governor the Mayor emergency officials, 1754, 1773
And I will never forget the sight of Ground Zero, 1773, 1783
The thick smoke made it hard to breathe or see, 1783, 1793
Some of the firefighters and other first responders we met had been on duty nonstop since the planes hit the towers, 1793, 1814
They had all lost friends, 1814, 1819
In a makeshift command center we were briefed on the damage and it was clear we were going to need a lot of help to recover New York and we were going to have to really make it our absolute mission to not only rebuild New York but to keep America safe.n" "Thats what I did for eight years as a senator, 1819, 1881
I never stopped fighting to keep our country safer and to ensure that first responders got the medical care they needed, 1881, 1902
And I think its important to reflect on what each of us has done in moments like that, 1902, 1920
Because a lot of the crises that come at a president are not predicted, 1920, 1934
They happen, 1934, 1936
Ill tell you a quick story, 1936, 1942
It was after President-elect Obama asked me to be secretary of state but before the inauguration, 1942, 1958
And I got a call to come to an emergency meeting in the White House in the Situation Room, 1958, 1977
And the new Obama national security team was on one side of table and the outgoing Bush national security team was on the other side, 1977, 2002
And the Bush Administration had gotten credible intelligence that there was going to be an attack at our inauguration.n" So even before we were sworn in to do our jobs we were faced with helping to make such a consequential decision, 2002, 2043
It really matters what your experience has what your values are whether you can be counted on to make that decision, 2043, 2064
You learn a lot about people in moments like that, 2064, 2074
And as I sat there with the pressure on having to think through in my own head how we evaluated this intelligence how we did everything we could to preserve our inauguration of our first African American president on the Mall in Washington.n "We made the decision to go forward obviously, 2074, 2125
Some of you might have been there, 2125, 2132
But we also did everything we could to double our efforts to find out about the intelligence and to secure the hundreds of thousands of people who would be there, 2132, 2162
So you have to ask yourself: in a crisis who would you trust? Who will listen to good advice keep a level head and make the right call? Because thats the person you want as our president and Commander in Chief.n" "Now lets get to the third question for all of the voters to consider about each of us, 2162, 2221
Do you know the difference between our allies and our adversaries? Now this may seem like an easy question, 2221, 2240
If you got it on an exam I think youd be able to answer it, 2240, 2255
But apparently its hard for Donald, 2255, 2261
He has picked fights with our friends, 2261, 2268
I mean the President of Mexico the British prime minister the German chancellor pretty much the entire nation of Japan… and he even picked a fight with the Pope, 2268, 2297
And at the same time he is praising tyrants and dictators like Saddam Hussein and Kim Jong Un in North Korea and Bashar al-Assad for their supposed strong leadership, 2297, 2326
He even praised the Chinese government for massacring protesters in Tiananmen Square, 2326, 2338
Trump has repeatedly suggested he would abandon our allies in Europe and Asia.n" "He has called NATO quote obsolete, 2338, 2357
Obsolete? NATO is the greatest military alliance in the history of the world, 2357, 2370
And its based on something called Article V which says An attack on one is an attack on all, 2370, 2389
And Article V has only been invoked one time: when our allies came to our defense after 9/11, 2389, 2407
We still have NATO allies fighting side by side working side by side with American troops in Afghanistan, 2407, 2425
They joined us in going after Al Qaeda and Bin Laden, 2425, 2436
Now were supposed to tell them we wont have their back?n" "And by the way—right now our NATO allies are helping identify and track terrorists who threaten America and Europe, 2436, 2466
Theyre hosting radar and missile defense installations that protect us against potential threats from Iran and elsewhere, 2466, 2483
And as our NATO forces in Afghanistan stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops they share the risks and burdens, 2483, 2501
Now theyre moving into the Baltic States to deter Russian aggression.n" "Treating our allies like the small businesses and contractors that Trump exploited and stiffed in Atlantic City – hanging them out to dry -- would make our country and our world less safe, 2501, 2545
And it would play right into the hands of Russia and China which are envious of our alliances and eager to see them weaken or fail, 2545, 2571
But maybe thats the point, 2571, 2576
Because whats most striking about all of this -- and I would argue most important for voters to consider – is the relationship between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.n" "As former Secretary Madeleine Albright put it and I quote her We have never seen a mind meld of the kind between the Russian leadership and a candidate for the presidency of the United States, 2576, 2642
Michael Morell who ran the CIA and grew up just a few miles from here has said that Putin is manipulating Donald, 2642, 2664
Putin is a trained intelligence officer from the old KGB, 2664, 2674
He knows he can use flattery to get into Donalds head -- to make Donald the Kremlins puppet, 2674, 2692
And It seems to be working.n" "Donald has signaled to Putin that he will let Russia do whatever it wants from Ukraine to Syria and beyond, 2692, 2718
Hes even said Putin is a stronger leader than President Obama, 2718, 2729
And it gets worse, 2729, 2733
The U.S, 2733, 2735
intelligence community has now confirmed that the Russian government which means Putin is directing cyber-attacks against targets in the United States to influence the outcome of our election.n" "So ask yourself why would Putin be trying to get Donald Trump elected President? Could it be because of all of the nice things Donald has said about him or the fact that hes promised to adopt pro-Kremlin policies or maybe because of his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs with ties to Putin? Since Donald still wont release his tax returns and dont hold your breath we dont know the full extent of his business relationships --but what we do know is disturbing.n" "And we know this: We are dealing with something unprecedented in the history of our country, 2735, 2863
A foreign adversary trying to influence our presidential election, 2863, 2872
That should scare everyone Democrat Republican and Independent, 2872, 2880
With the election just eight days away this cant wait any longer, 2880, 2892
Donald Trump should immediately disclose all of his ties and connections to the Kremlin and its associates, 2892, 2909
The American people deserve to know the full extent of these links and how they relate to what the Russians are doing in our election.n" "When you step back and take it all in its no surprise that 50 Republican national security experts wrote an open letter saying that they will not vote for Donald Trump because he would be – in their words – the most reckless President in American history, 2909, 2981
Its no surprise that not a single former President Secretary of State or Defense or National Security Advisor from either party has endorsed him, 2981, 3005
Its no surprise that Bob Gates who served eight presidents over 50 years Democrats and Republicans alike has said Trump is and I quote beyond repair… stubbornly uninformed about the world and how to lead our country and government… temperamentally unsuited to lead our men and women in uniform… unqualified and unfit to be commander-in-chief.n" "I hope you and voters across Ohio and America will think about all of these national security issues when you cast your vote in this election, 3005, 3086
Think about what it takes to lead -- and how we want to secure the safety of our country our children and our grandchildren, 3086, 3110
And who is best to do that, 3110, 3117
So make no mistake that really is what is on the ballot this year, 3117, 3131
Its not just my name and Donald Trumps name, 3131, 3140
Its our future, 3140, 3143
Our security, 3143, 3145
Our values, 3145, 3147
Its who we are as a country.n" "Donald Trump has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart, 3147, 3170
But the good news is: Theres another vision for America, 3170, 3180
Instead of dark and divisive its hopeful and inclusive and optimistic and unified, 3180, 3193
And it is big-hearted not small-minded, 3193, 3199
Its about lifting people up not tearing each other down, 3199, 3209
Its a vision that says as I believe in my heart that we are stronger together.n" Millions of people across our country are standing up and saying: We believe in an America that is great because it is good, 3209, 3248
That is Democrats Republicans and Independents, 3248, 3254
Because we believe in an America where women are respected, 3254, 3264
An America where veterans are honored parents are supported and workers are paid fairly … an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong…, 3264, 3290
an America that leads in the world and lives up to our values… where everyone counts and everyone has a place, 3290, 3311
Where the American dream is big enough for everyone.n "This goes way beyond policies and partisanship, 3311, 3327
Were talking about what it really means to be an American in the 21st century, 3327, 3342
About the basic lessons we want to teach boys and girls kids and grandkids, 3342, 3356
It turns out if you dig deep enough through all the mud of politics eventually you hit something hard and true, 3356, 3377
A foundation of fundamental values that unite us as Americans – basic beliefs about equality and opportunity and freedom and common decency.n" "Thats something to defend – and to build on, 3377, 3408
And in the end thats what this election is all about, 3408, 3419
Here in Ohio you can make the difference, 3419, 3427
Early voting has already begun, 3427, 3432
So now is the time, 3432, 3437
Every phone call you make every door you knock moves us forward, 3437, 3449
You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer, 3449, 3459
Or text J-O-I-N to 4-7-2-4-6 to do the same.n" Sometimes -- if you have studied history -- you know the fate of the greatest nations comes down to single moments in time, 3459, 3491
This is one of those make-or-break moments for the United States, 3491, 3502
And it truly is in your hands as it should be, 3502, 3513
When your kids and grandkids ask you what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line I hope you will be able to say: I voted for a better stronger fairer America, 3513, 3547
A place where our future will be created and charted by people will have confidence that that the best days of America are still ahead of us, 3547, 3574
Particularly young people who I believe absolutely should help make that future!n "So lets come together let us make clear that we are going to stand up for an America that we believe in because that America believes in us, 3574, 3614
And we are going to prove once and for all that love trumps hate, 3614, 3628
Thank you." , 3628, 3630
