" The breaking news this hour, 0, 6
Its now official, 6, 9
Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses, 9, 20
She beat Bernie Sanders by a razor-thin margin just 0.2 of a percentage point, 20, 34
Her campaign claimed victory overnight but the Iowa Democratic Party has just issued the final results, 34, 50
They say Hillary Clinton is the winner of the Iowa caucuses, 50, 61
And Secretary Clinton is joining us now from Nashua New Hampshire, 61, 72
Madam Secretary thanks very much for joining us, 72, 80
Whats your reaction to the official results now declaring you the winner of the Iowa caucuses?"  I am so thrilled Wolf, 80, 101
I feel really good and very grateful to the team I had on the ground to the tens of thousands of Iowans who volunteered knocked on doors came out and caucused last night, 101, 134
And I could feel the energy building in the weeks leading up to the caucus, 134, 149
I was out there making my case about what I want to do and what I think our country must do to get real results with more jobs rising incomes build on the Affordable Care Act deal with climate change clean energy defend our rights all the things I feel passionate about, 149, 201
And I could just watch and in fact in that last week I had so many people come up to me and say that they had decided to support me and it could not have been better, 201, 238
It was a great great night, 238, 244
 You said last night you breathed a big sigh of relief your words — a big sigh of relief, 244, 263
What did you mean by that? " Well as you recall my luck was not that good last time around, 263, 283
And it was wonderful to win the caucus and to have that experience of all the hard work the grassroots organizing pay off the way it did, 283, 310
Now were here in New Hampshire and we are going to have a contest of ideas, 310, 326
Im looking forward to the forum tomorrow night on CNN and then a debate Thursday night here in New Hampshire because I think that Democratic voters and other Americans want to know what are the principal differences between me and my friend and opponent Senator Sanders, 326, 372
And I want to get that information out there, 372, 381
I think its important people understand that good ideas are one thing but you got to know how to implement, 381, 401
Youve got to have a record of getting results, 401, 410
And Im taking my ideas and my record to the people of New Hampshire this week." " The Sanders campaign says they wont have this debate Thursday night with you unless you agree to a subsequent debate before the New York primary in New York City, 410, 456
Are you willing to agree to that?" " Well you know Wolf this is really hard to follow because when we said we would do the debate they came back with conditions, 456, 488
We met the conditions, 488, 492
Then they said they want different conditions, 492, 499
And weve tried to be very accommodating but you know we have agreed with everything that they have asked us to do, 499, 521
And I sure hope — were in Bernie Sanders backyard here in New Hampshire, 521, 535
I sure hope he intends to show up in his neighboring state and let the people of New Hampshire see us both on the debate stage."  Well just to press the point the debate in New York City that they want are you accepting that? " No, 535, 582
Weve accepted all of their conditions, 582, 588
We did that last week, 588, 593
And they keep trying to add new conditions which you know raises questions about how ready or willing they are to debate here in New Hampshire, 593, 619
We met their conditions, 619, 623
We agreed to more debates something that I wanted to do because I think its great to debate and were ready, 623, 644
Im going to be there Thursday night." " All right, 644, 654
Lets move on, 654, 657
The senators campaign — they want to do not necessarily a recount but they want to check the voting in Iowa, 657, 678
Is that OK with you?" " You know look I — they — I can say that I believe the Democratic Party of Iowa ran a good caucus from everything that our people told me, 678, 713
There was an enormous turnout which everybody said would tremendously favor Senator Sanders, 713, 726
If there are legitimate issues both sides I dont think the Democratic Party has any problems with that, 726, 744
But from everything we have learned and know I won and Im very proud of that."  Back in 2008 as you well remember you lost Iowa but then you came back to win New Hampshire, 744, 779
This time you won Iowa, 779, 784
Can you win New Hampshire one week from today? " Well I think its certainly what Im aiming for, 784, 803
I care a lot about this state, 803, 810
I view it as being the first-in-the-nation primary for a reason, 810, 821
I know that they tend to favor their neighbors, 821, 830
Thats the pattern the history of the primary, 830, 838
And Senator Sanders is a neighbor, 838, 844
But I think we will have a good contest talking about what results we can produce what our records have been both in domestic policy foreign policy national security and I think the people of New Hampshire will get a chance to really evaluate both of us, 844, 891
And I feel good about my prospects." " You described yourself in your speech last night as a progressive that gets things done, 891, 914
Are you suggesting Bernie Sanders — he may be a progressive but he cant get things done?" " Im talking about my record, 914, 937
Im talking about the Childrens Health Insurance Program for 8 million kids, 937, 949
Im talking about getting health care for National Guard members, 949, 959
Im talking about helping to push through a treaty to lower nuclear weapons between us and the Russians when I was secretary of state, 959, 983
Im talking about building the coalition against Iran to bring them to the negotiating table and so many other issues, 983, 1003
I have a very long record of getting results for people, 1003, 1014
Thats what I care about, 1014, 1019
You know I am all for laying out our ideology talking about our ideas, 1019, 1033
I think thats great and it gives you the direction that you want to head, 1033, 1048
But at the end of the day what matters to me is that we move our country forward, 1048, 1066
We actually get more good jobs with rising incomes, 1066, 1075
We get equal pay for women, 1075, 1081
We actually begin to move toward early childhood education and paid family leave, 1081, 1094
And we are ready to really go into the rest of the 21st century with the kind of confidence and optimism that I think our country should be having, 1094, 1123
So Im going to lay out my record lay out my ideas and Senator Sanders can certainly lay out his own and well leave it up to the people of New Hampshire to decide what they think is the best choice for them and their families and the results they want to see for themselves in our country."  As you know according to the entrance polls in Iowa Bernie Sanders did a lot better than you did with younger voters younger men and even younger women, 1123, 1209
Why do you think is he doing so well with younger voters out there? " Im thrilled to see so many young people get into the political process and I was very proud of all the young people who worked for me volunteered for me supported me, 1209, 1256
Thats all to the good and its great for the Democratic Party, 1256, 1268
But Im going to have some work to do to reach out to young voters maybe first-time voters who have to make a tough decision as they evaluate who should be our president our commander in chief and I intend to do that laying out my case where we contrast on the issues what I think can be done to get college to be affordable, 1268, 1333
I think my plan is going to really help the people who need it most without ballooning costs, 1333, 1351
Im going to set forth my plan to refinance student debt a problem I hear throughout New Hampshire and the country and why I think my plan will help more young people really get started with their lives, 1351, 1389
The emphasis I want to make on small business my call that young people join our campaign and then be part of making us the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, 1389, 1421
And lets defend our rights, 1421, 1426
I am very proud that I got the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I got the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign that I got the endorsement of The Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly and so many others because they know me and they know what I have done, 1426, 1481
They know the kind of leader I am, 1481, 1489
And I want young people to know that as well."  As you know Marco Rubio did rather well coming in at an impressive third place in the Iowa Republican caucuses just behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, 1489, 1526
Ted Cruz won Iowa, 1526, 1530
What do you think about the possibility if you do get the Democratic nomination of running against Senator Rubio in a general election? " You know Wolf Im not thinking that far ahead, 1530, 1563
My timeframe is next Tuesday and the primary in New Hampshire and then Ill go on to the caucuses in Nevada and the primary at the end of the month in South Carolina and then to the states that lie ahead, 1563, 1604
Im going let the Republicans you know decide who their nominee will be, 1604, 1617
I will be prepared to run against and win no matter who they nominate, 1617, 1631
I think as everybody is well aware I am pretty battle tested, 1631, 1643
Its important to have gone through this to know what the Republicans will do, 1643, 1657
Theyre already running $6 million of ads against me along with their you know Wall Street buddies, 1657, 1674
And so they know who they dont want to be the Democratic nominee, 1674, 1687
And I take that as perversely flattering because they also know that I mean what I say and Ill do what I have said to make sure that they dont ever wreck our economy again, 1687, 1722
So Im going take them on as I have over the years and then when I win I will certainly reach out work with them and find common ground wherever we can."  Madam Secretary thanks very much for joining us, 1722, 1762
Congratulations on your win in Iowa, 1762, 1768
 Thank you so much Wolf, 1768, 1773
Great to talk to you again, 1773, 1779
 Thank you, 1779, 1781
