 Secretary Clinton thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa, 0, 13
 Thank you Alisyn, 13, 16
 We are in Ames Iowa --  Yes, 16, 23
—where the temperature as we speak is one degree, 23, 32
 Uh-hm, 32, 33
" And I know that you have been going to countless campaign events here and Im wondering when you get up in the morning in Iowa if there are ever times you question your life choices?" " Absolutely no, 33, 72
You know I grew up in Chicago, 72, 79
Im used to cold weather, 79, 84
It doesnt bother me, 84, 88
In fact Im somewhat reassured that there is a real winter that we are actually seeing snow and lower temperatures, 88, 108
But I get up every day whether Im in Iowa in New Hampshire wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people hear their stories give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very you know reinvigorating all the time."  So lets talk about the tightening race between you and Bernie Sanders, 108, 185
Bernie Sanders is speaking to reporters on Monday night here in Iowa, 185, 197
And he said that your campaign is in quote "serious trouble." Is that how you feel? " Not at all, 197, 217
In fact I have always known that if you are going to run to be president particularly in the Democratic Party its a long hard challenging road, 217, 244
And so Ive been in these elections before, 244, 252
They always tighten up as people begin to make up their minds as they look at the candidates totally predictable, 252, 272
I feel really really good about the campaign organization that I have, 272, 284
A caucus is different from a primary, 284, 291
It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate but Im asking Iowans if theyll stand up for me on caucus night, 291, 335
I will be standing up for them all through my presidency." " There is a new Quinnipiac poll out just about one hour ago in which Bernie Sanders is now beating you in Iowa, 335, 369
It is 49 percent to 44 percent, 369, 376
It is the first time that this has happened that hes been beating you in Iowa since September, 376, 394
We are 20 days out, 394, 399
Does he have more momentum than you?" " Well the funny thing Alisyn is after that poll came out about an hour later there was a PPP poll where I was leading him by the same margin about six points up, 399, 440
I dont pay any attention to this, 440, 447
I dont feel that its a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night, 447, 464
I can only tell you that the energy the enthusiasm the excitement of my volunteers my organizers the voters who come who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building, 464, 496
Thats my experience, 496, 499
So Ill let people poll and try to figure out who is going to show up, 499, 515
Im looking at people who are showing up making up their minds and trying to you know convince them to come out and caucus for me." " Why dont you feel that the polls are good reflection of whats going to happen in the caucus?" " Because they are so unpredictable, 515, 566
And its gotten increasingly difficult to poll, 566, 573
And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus, 573, 590
So thats been my experience, 590, 595
Ive watched this a long time, 595, 601
Ive had a prior election where I campaigned in Iowa, 601, 611
So I just put that aside, 611, 617
Ill let pundits and others worry about whos up and whos down, 617, 629
I just get up every day like we were saying going out there making my case drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents but there are real differences, 629, 663
And we need a spirited debate, 663, 669
Because after the first of the year a lot more people start paying attention, 669, 683
And now I know its you know the make or break time people make up their minds."  Bernie Sanders is also winning in New Hampshire, 683, 708
Not surprising, 708, 710
He is from a neighboring state, 710, 716
Have you considered what would happen if he wins in Iowa and New Hampshire what your plan is? " I dont think about that, 716, 740
Im going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary, 740, 763
But this is a national campaign, 763, 769
Weve been organizing in South Carolina in Nevada a lot of the March 1st states the March 15th states, 769, 788
Remember I campaigned all the way into June last time, 788, 798
And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the you know changes in peoples concerns going into this election that we wouldnt know exactly how the outcome would be for you know a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses, 798, 841
So Im going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me, 841, 859
And even though as you say Senator Sanders as a neighbor and a neighbor never lost in New Hampshire Im going to take that challenge on and do the best I can to get people in New Hampshire to support me as well."  Vice President Joe Biden offered his thoughts to CNN on why he thinks Bernie Sanders is resonating, 859, 919
He said that he thinks its about Senator Sanders positions on income inequality, 919, 932
And the Vice President said quote "Its relatively new for Hillary to talk about that, 932, 947
Thats been Bernies, 947, 950
No one questions Bernies authenticity on those issues." Whats your reaction? " Well the Vice President who I deeply respect and regard as a friend went on to say as I recall, 950, 982
But you know Hillary Clinton has a lot of very good economic policies that are thoughtful and on and on, 982, 1002
Look I have been working toward closing the gaps between people poor people and well-off people primarily all my adult life, 1002, 1023
I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund, 1023, 1032
I helped to reform the education system in Arkansas, 1032, 1041
I was a legal services lawyer defending poor people, 1041, 1050
I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husbands administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured." "I have been on this issue in many different ways, 1050, 1093
How do we make education more equal? How do we make health care more equal? Of course thats tied to income equality but there is also a broader range of issues that I have a long record of addressing, 1093, 1132
And when I was in the Senate I took on corporate executive pay, 1132, 1145
A lot of the abuses that I thought were there, 1145, 1155
I took on these derivatives and credit default swaps that contributed to the collapse of the economy and the great recession, 1155, 1176
I stood up to Wall Street, 1176, 1182
I called them out, 1182, 1186
So I have a very long record, 1186, 1193
I have a broader agenda, 1193, 1198
Its not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and thats what I tried to do." " And since you have been devoting much of your career to talking about this why do you think the Vice President would say its more in Bernies wheelhouse and its about his authenticity?" " Oh I dont know, 1198, 1275
But you know I have a lot of regard for the vice president, 1275, 1288
And I think today he clarified what he said and said he was talking about me when I was Secretary of State, 1288, 1310
Well when I was Secretary of State I couldnt talk about domestic policy, 1310, 1323
There is an unwritten rule you do not meddle in domestic policy when you are secretary of state or for that matter secretary of defense, 1323, 1348
So yes for four years despite a long career both in and out of public service where I have been relentless in talking about these issues there were four years when I did not, 1348, 1382
I talked about how we were going to get Iran to the negotiating table and try to prevent them from getting a nuclear weapon how were going to you know deal with a rising China what were going to do about womens rights something that goes to the heart of inequality, 1382, 1433
So I had a different agenda because I had a different job." " So you didnt take Bidens comments as a slight?"  No, 1433, 1456
Not at all, 1456, 1459
 OK, 1459, 1460
You are introducing your tax plan, 1460, 1466
One of the headlines is that you would impose a four percent surcharge on incomes over $5 million, 1466, 1484
And I believe that that would raise about $150 billion over ten years, 1484, 1497
Does that go far enough in addressing income inequality? " Well weve got a variety of proposals, 1497, 1514
Not only the four percent surcharge which I call the fair share surcharge, 1514, 1527
The so-called Buffet Rule which would have a minimum tax rate for people making more than $1 million limiting deductions to 28 percent with a charitable exception, 1527, 1554
Going after a lot of the subsidies that for example still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future, 1554, 1587
So I have put forth plans paid family leave tuition debt-free tuition for public colleges." "Capping prescription drug costs and much more, 1587, 1609
And it would cost about $100 billion a year all of which I pay for, 1609, 1624
In contrast Senator Sanders has some very big ideas but he hasnt yet told anybody how he would pay for them, 1624, 1645
And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st, 1645, 1664
Well if you wait too long nobody will have a chance to see them or analyze them, 1664, 1681
And so I am very clear about what I would do and how I would pay for it."  Another point of conflict between you and Senator Sanders is on gun policy, 1681, 1712
 Uh-hm, 1712, 1713
 We just watched this very emotional event this morning, 1713, 1722
 Yes, 1722, 1723
 That you were involved in where this mom who lost two children --  Right -- —to gun violence got up and spoke, 1723, 1745
And it was really heartbreaking to hear her, 1745, 1753
It sounds like she lost her children to criminals, 1753, 1762
 Yes, 1762, 1763
 So how would you stop that? " This is a very big difference in this campaign, 1763, 1779
Because as you saw I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members, 1779, 1813
It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence, 1813, 1840
And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now, 1840, 1854
We lose on an average 90 people a day, 1854, 1863
It has to stop Alisyn, 1863, 1868
Ive been in this campaign advocating for comprehensive background checks closing the gun show loophole closing the online loophole closing whats called the Charleston loophole." "You know there was a loophole my opponent voted for it Senator Sanders that at the end of three days business days you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not, 1868, 1928
The killer in Charleston who bought that gun if there had just been a little more time it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record, 1928, 1966
We have saved a lot of lives, 1966, 1973
I cant put an exact number on it, 1973, 1981
But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times more than two million people the Brady campaign says 2.4 million purchasers have been stopped from buying guns." "So we are talking about violent criminals, 1981, 2019
We are talking about domestic abusers, 2019, 2025
We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill, 2025, 2033
We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans wont close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns, 2033, 2057
I feel passionately about this, 2057, 2062
And the cumulation from Sandy Hook to the community college in Oregon the fact that we have so many mass killings in the last few years I think it certainly motivated the President and I am so proud to support him and I want to make this a voting issue in this campaign."   " I want to talk about an issue Donald Trump wanted to make an issue in this campaign that is—are allegations from your husbands past, 2062, 2140
He is going further actually than that, 2140, 2147
He is making it about you, 2147, 2153
He is saying that you are an enabler of bad behavior and of sexual assault." "Whats your response to Donald Trump?" " I have no response, 2153, 2179
Im going to let him say whatever he wants to say, 2179, 2190
He can run his campaign however he wishes, 2190, 2198
Im going to keep talking about what the next president will have to do starting January 20th 2017." "I have deep disagreements with what hes proposing, 2198, 2224
His tax plans would cut trillions of dollars of taxes from the wealthy and corporations, 2224, 2239
He doesnt believe in equal pay, 2239, 2245
He thinks that American workers are already making too much." "So Im going to draw the contrast with him that I think the American people are interested in seeing." " But when someone accuses you of being an enabler of sexual assault dont you need to respond to it? I mean particularly since this is an issue you wanted to talk about on the campaign trail, 2245, 2311
Cant this sexual assault—you say survivors need to be believed and they need to be heard." "So when hes accusing you of doing something that is the antithesis of what you want to talk about dont you need to address it?" " Im going to let the American voters decide whats relevant and whats not relevant in their decision as to who theyre going to support."  I have a few more questions, 2311, 2383
Donald Trump was on "The Tonight Show" and asked about the possibility of you two running against each other if thats how this all plays out in November, 2383, 2411
He said that would be quote "an amazing thing."    Yes it would be amazing, 2411, 2425
I would look forward to it, 2425, 2431
"Look I think this is serious business, 2431, 2438
Campaigns always have some great stories and great characters, 2438, 2447
Thats part of the political process, 2447, 2453
This is really serious business who the next president is, 2453, 2463
We are either going to build on the progress that weve made or were going to see it ripped away, 2463, 2483
We are either going to defend human rights and civil rights and womens rights and gay rights and voting rights and workers rights and all the rest that is at stake or we are going to turn the clock back." "And thats why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high, 2483, 2547
And if Im fortunate enough to get the nomination I will run hard against whomever the Republicans nominee because they represent a brand of politics and policies that I think would hurt our country, 2547, 2581
I dont want to see that happen." " Lets say you get the nomination, 2581, 2595
Lets say you win the presidency." " Yes lets say that." " Lets say it." "And on day one you walk into the Oval Office whats the first phone call you make?" " Well I think the very first phone call would be to whoever Ive asked to be the chief of staff of the White House, 2595, 2652
Lets get a meeting together lets get our agenda together, 2652, 2662
Theres a lot we have to get going, 2662, 2670
The earlier we start the better well be off and well get more accomplished." "Because I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination right then and there how we organize the White House how we organize the cabinet, 2670, 2712
Whats the legislative agenda?" "You know the time between an election and inauguration is short, 2712, 2727
You cant wait, 2727, 2730
I mean you cant take anything for granted, 2730, 2738
You have to keep working as hard as you possibly can but I think its important to start planning because we know what happens if you get behind in getting your agenda out and getting your appointments made, 2738, 2776
You lose time, 2776, 2779
And youre not doing the work that the American people elected you to do."  Before I let you go I definitely want to ask you about your granddaughter, 2779, 2807
You talk about her on the campaign trail, 2807, 2815
Today is I believe or recently Chelsea is making her first appearance on the campaign trail, 2815, 2831
 Yes, 2831, 2832
 She said she believes that you becoming a grandmother is a driving force behind your campaign, 2832, 2848
How so? " Well shes right because I feel very fortunate, 2848, 2859
I like to point out Im the granddaughter of a factory worker who came to this country as a young immigrant, 2859, 2880
Went to work in the lace mills in Scranton Pennsylvania." "So here I am three generations later asking people to vote for me to become their president, 2880, 2907
And we have this amazing 15-month-old grandchild with another on the way next summer, 2907, 2921
And so I think a lot about the future but I think not just about her future because were going to do everything we can to make sure she has the best opportunities life can offer but I think about what kind of country shell become an adult in and what kind of world is going to be waiting for her." "I want to make sure—its not just our grandchild but every child who has the opportunity to go as far to fulfill their God-given potential as possible, 2921, 3009
And a lot of that depends on the kinds of decisions that our presidents make, 3009, 3024
Its not you know you have to have family support you have to have community support." I wrote a book called "It Takes A Village." I understand that, 3024, 3052
Do you kids have health care? Thats why I created the childrens health care insurance program because too many didnt, 3052, 3072
Your kids have good education thats why Im for early childhood because too many kids come to school unprepared, 3072, 3091
How about college affordability? Too many kids are weeded out because they cant afford to start or stay, 3091, 3109
I go through the list of what is really dampening the opportunities that young people in our country have right now, 3109, 3130
And I want to be the president who unleashes that potential again, 3130, 3142
" And when you think about your grandchildrens future are you worried or hopeful?" " Im always hopeful Alisyn, 3142, 3161
Im always hopeful, 3161, 3164
I think this is the greatest country." "When I listen to the negative comments made about our country on the campaign stage predominantly by the Republicans I mean look at what weve come back from, 3164, 3199
It was a Republican administration under which we had the Great Recession, 3199, 3211
That is just a fact." "President Obama inherited an economy that was losing 800000 jobs a month, 3211, 3228
I dont think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out and getting us standing again, 3228, 3246
So I know that choices really matter in politics but I am absolutely committed to the belief the conviction that I have that our country is resilient were strong were smart." "Given the right leadership we can do anything, 3246, 3285
Thats why I actually am quite optimistic and confident about the future."  Secretary Clinton thank you so much, 3285, 3303
 Thank you Alisyn, 3303, 3306
 Great to talk to you, 3306, 3311
" Its great to see you." , 3311, 3317
