"Thank you, 0, 2
Its great to be back in North Carolina." In 62 days we are going to win this state – and we are going to win the White House, 2, 30
This is our chance to end years of injustice corruption and betrayal, 30, 42
This is our chance to solve all of the problems that have gone unsolved for so many years, 42, 60
For how long have people been saying Washington is broken and controlled by special interests? This is the year we can finally fix it, 60, 84
"Thats because change has to come from outside of our broken and corrupt system." We will never fix our rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place, 84, 117
We will never solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created our problems, 117, 132
So to every American who has been waiting for real change your wait is over – your moment of liberation is at hand, 132, 155
A vote for Trump is a vote to restore Democracy to heal our economy and to bring millions of jobs back into every forgotten stretch of this country, 155, 183
The change will begin my first day in office, 183, 192
First we are going to eliminate every unconstitutional executive order and restore the rule of law to our land, 192, 211
Then we are going to begin implementing plans for construction of a wall along our southern border, 211, 228
This will keep out the violent cartels and gangs as well as their drugs that are poisoning our youth, 228, 247
"But thats just the beginning." I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare, 247, 268
Under Senate rules that bill can be passed with 51 votes – meaning a Republican Congress and a Republican President can save Americans from this disaster in a single afternoon, 268, 298
"Its going to be a very busy first day." "I am going to instruct the Department of State to immediately suspend the Syrian refugee resettlement program and develop plans for the construction of a safe zone in the region, 298, 337
My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees, 337, 346
She is running to be Americas Angela Merkel." I am also going to notify all countries that refuse to take back dangerous illegal immigrants who have committed crimes in this country that they will lose access to our visa programs if they continue to do so, 346, 392
This is the measure that is called for under current law and I will enforce it, 392, 408
The Secretary of State is required to take this action but Hillary Clinton refused to do so – resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into U.S, 408, 436
communities, 436, 437
Furthermore I will direct every agency in government to begin identifying all wasteful job-killing regulations and they are going to be removed – this will include lifting the restrictions on American energy, 437, 469
I will also notify our NAFTA partners of my intention to renegotiate the deal and will withdraw from the TPP before it can be ratified, 469, 494
We are going to bring these jobs back to North Carolina, 494, 505
"Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA she supported Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization and she supported the TPP, 505, 523
She just does whatever her donors tell her to do." In a Trump Administration we will negotiate trade deals on behalf of American workers – not on behalf of global corporations, 523, 554
We will work to ensure farmers in North Carolina have the tools they need to thrive at home and compete on a level playing field in foreign markets – and that means negotiating fair trade deals that put America First, 554, 594
Crucially I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: they will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS, 594, 626
Any nation who shares in this goal will be our friend in this mission, 626, 640
For years we have been caught up in endless wars and conflicts under the leadership of failed politicians and a failed foreign policy establishment in Washington D.C, 640, 667
The same people who made every wrong decision in Iraq Afghanistan Libya Syria Egypt China and Russia are the same people who are advising Hillary Clinton, 667, 693
I am proud instead to have the support of our warfighting generals active duty military officers and top military experts who know how to win – and know how to keep us out of endless war, 693, 729
Today 88 retired U.S, 729, 733
generals and admirals signed a letter of endorsement, 733, 741
"Thats one of the biggest differences between me and Hillary Clinton, 741, 752
She favors what has been called military adventurism – rushing to invade countries displacing millions of families then inviting the refugees into our country – creating power vacuums filled by terrorist groups like ISIS." I believe in a foreign policy based on our national interests that focuses on American security and regional stability – instead of using our military to create Democracies in countries with no Democratic history, 752, 820
We will work to form partnerships overseas based on a long-term strategy of defeating Radical Islamic Terrorism, 820, 837
We will first have to reverse the damage inflicted by Hillary Clinton – her legacy of failure in the Middle East Russia and Asia has made Americans less safe than ever before, 837, 869
As part of our plan to avoid and prevent foreign conflicts we are going to rebuild our depleted military, 869, 888
This is the ultimate deterrent, 888, 893
We will be guided by those three famous words: Peace Through Strength, 893, 905
"I will ask Congress to eliminate the sequester and immediately re-invest in our military, 905, 919
Right now we have the smallest air force since 1947 the smallest army since 1939 and one of the smallest Navys since 1917." Like the Cold War we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting our classified secrets, 919, 962
Hillary Clinton has taught us all how much of a problem we have with cyber-security, 962, 977
"We cant have someone in the Oval Office who doesnt understand the meaning of the word confidential." "The new revelations about Hillary Clinton from the just-released FBI documents make more clear than ever that she fails to meet the minimum standard for running for public office, 977, 1023
If she applied for a low-level job at the State Department today she couldnt even get a security clearance." Her conduct is disqualifying, 1023, 1046
"Lets run through what we discovered in those FBI documents, 1046, 1056
Its important and were hoping Matt Lauer will ask about it on Wednesday night at the Townhall." Its clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton lied about her handling of confidential information, 1056, 1089
She repeatedly told the country that she understood the classified system then she told the FBI she didnt understand that the letter "C" meant confidential in the documents she emailed, 1089, 1119
"On 39 separate occasions she said she couldnt recall details about her mishandling of classified information and she couldnt even name one step she took to make sure foreign hackers couldnt get into her server, 1119, 1154
Keep in mind that her insecure emails included emails about the drone program." "Its also clear from the FBI report that Hillary Clinton and her top aides knowingly destroyed evidence and covered-up their actions, 1154, 1188
After her private server was revealed last March her staff deleted all the emails and wiped it clean using a software designed to prevent any recovery called BleachBit." "They used hammers to destroy phones so they couldnt be turned over later – and by the way who uses 12 different phones in 4 years? The only people who use that many phones are usually involved in very very shady activity." "People who have nothing to hide dont smash phones with hammers, 1188, 1269
People who have nothing to hide dont bleach their emails or destroy evidence to keep it from being publicly archived as required under federal law." "Hillary Clinton failed to turn over thousands of documents then tried to shield her criminal conduct by having her chief-of-staff declare herself to be Hillary Clintons private attorney." "Hillary and her top aides told the FBI and others in related lawsuits that they couldnt recall or remember key facts hundreds of different times – and thats in addition to the guy who set up the server pleading the 5th." No one takes all the risks Hillary Clinton took unless they are trying to cover up massive crimes, 1269, 1381
Hillary Clinton was using the State Department to dole out special favors and access to her friends and donors, 1381, 1400
"Its called pay-for-play." "One example of pay-for-play is what the Clintons did in Haiti, 1400, 1414
Let me stop here for a second and say how much we love and appreciate the Haitian-American community in Florida and across our country, 1414, 1438
We send our prayers to the many still suffering in Haiti from the earthquake." But while Haiti has suffered the Clintons and their pals have cashed in, 1438, 1465
"Bill and Hillarys brothers have signed housing deals in Haiti and one wound up on the board of a gold mining company." Clinton Foundation donors have seen the Clintons pave the way for their investments, 1465, 1500
"In one deal Hillary Clinton set aside environmental and labor rules to help a South Korean company with a record of violating workers rights set up what amounts to a sweat shop in Haiti." The facility has produced only a fraction of the jobs it promised and faces reports of wage theft, 1500, 1552
People are asking: where did all the money go? This November it is up to the American people to stop the Clintons from raiding America the way they have raided so many other people and places, 1552, 1588
"One of the groups in America that have been harmed the most by Hillary Clintons policies are African-Americans, 1588, 1606
She sees them only as votes not as people worthy of a better future." Many African-Americans have succeeded so greatly in this country we will honor and protect their achievements, 1606, 1636
That includes lowering taxes for our small business owners to fifteen percent, 1636, 1648
But millions of African-Americans in our inner cities remain trapped in poverty joblessness and failing schools, 1648, 1664
The Democratic Party has run the inner cities for fifty sixty seventy years and more, 1664, 1679
4 in 10 African-American children in poverty including 45% of those under the age of six, 1679, 1695
58% of African-American youth are not working, 1695, 1702
2900 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, 1702, 1715
Nationwide African-Americans are nearly 60% of the murder victims under the age of 22, 1715, 1729
This is a national crisis – and anybody who fails to understand that is not fit to seek the Presidency of the United States, 1729, 1753
To those suffering in crime and poverty I say: give Donald J, 1753, 1765
Trump a chance, 1765, 1768
What do you have to lose by embracing our platform of change? We are going to bring back your jobs rebuild your cities and give parents and students school choice, 1768, 1798
I will never ever ever take you for granted, 1798, 1807
We are going to push a new Civil Rights agenda, 1807, 1817
We believe every American has the right to a safe community a great education and government that protects their jobs, 1817, 1837
This weekend I had the honor to join a church service in Detroit at the Great Faith Ministries International with the amazing Bishop Wayne Jackson, 1837, 1862
It was an incredible and deeply moving experience, 1862, 1870
I will fight for Detroit for Chicago for Baltimore and for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People, 1870, 1901
Let me quote the same passage from the Bible I read on Saturday from 1 John 4: "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another God lives in us and his love is made complete in us." Imagine what we our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One Flag, 1901, 1963
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a New American Future, 1963, 1982
In this future we will respect the dignity of all Americans – and that means great jobs great schools and great neighborhoods, 1982, 2004
We will keep our children safe – which requires secure borders a strong military and supporting law enforcement, 2004, 2022
Jobs will return prosperity will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores, 2022, 2038
"Government corruption will end – and the State Department will answer to the voters not Hillary Clintons donors." Republicans are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and come November 8th we will once again have a government of by and for the people, 2038, 2080
We Will Make America Proud Again, 2080, 2086
We Will Make America Strong Again, 2086, 2092
We Will Make America Safe Again, 2092, 2098
And Will Make America Great Again, 2098, 2104
Thank you and God Bless! , 2104, 2109
