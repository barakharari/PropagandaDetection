I am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this years historic convention in Philadelphia and I know that this weeks events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership, 23, 58
Theres simply no one better at taking the fight to the Republicans than Debbie–which is why I am glad that she has agreed to serve as honorary chair of my campaigns 50-state program to gain ground and elect Democrats in every part of the country and will continue to serve as a surrogate for my campaign nationally in Florida and in other key states, 58, 122
I look forward to campaigning with Debbie in Florida and helping her in her re-election bid–because as President I will need fighters like Debbie in Congress who are ready on day one to get to work for the American people." , 122, 162
