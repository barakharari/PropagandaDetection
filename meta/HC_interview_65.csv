 This morning there is some good news though for Clinton, 0, 10
She won the endorsement of the "Des Moines Register", 10, 19
By the way as did Marco Rubio on the Republican side but one would argue the "Des Moines Register" will probably have a greater impact among Democratic caucus goers, 19, 48
So joining me from Cedar Rapids Iowa is the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, 48, 63
Madam Secretary—welcome back, 63, 66
" Thank you—Chuck, 66, 69
Its good to talk to you this morning."  You got it, 69, 80
Let me just start with this, 80, 86
Your opponent 74 years old calls himself a socialist started this campaign with next to zero name recognition, 86, 104
You have 38 of 44 U.S, 104, 110
senators endorsing 12 of 18 Democratic governors, 110, 117
He has zero, 117, 120
What happened? Whats gone wrong? Save me the "we always knew this was going to be a close race" answer, 120, 140
" Well Chuck—look I think its actually good for the debate that were having that there is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side and I know obviously so does senator Sanders on his." "We have a big choice to make, 140, 185
And its exciting, 185, 188
I had a great couple of events yesterday, 188, 196
Im enthusiastically pursuing the opportunity to reach every single voter in Iowa and were going to see what happens, 196, 215
I feel good about where we are, 215, 222
Obviously well find out a week from tomorrow." "But if you look at the differences between Senator Sanders and myself I just dont think we cant wait, 222, 249
We cant wait to make progress on the myriad of issues that I think were going to be facing in the next administration, 249, 272
I want to build on the progress that President Obama has made and he has a different approach, 272, 290
And thats what voters are trying to determine which they prefer."  Look as you know the caucuses sometimes are about passion enthusiasm, 290, 312
Let me read you something that was in the "New York Times" from Gayle Collins, 312, 327
"Nevertheless you cant ignore the fact that Hillary Clinton is now the candidate of the aging Democratic establishment whose supporters pray for a low turnout on the Election Day, 327, 356
That might get her nominated in the long run but its not really the kind of image that makes you go whistling into the election booth." By the way she wrote that in 2008, 356, 390
By the way she wrote that in 2008 Madam Secretary, 390, 400
Is there a deja vu happening here? " No there isnt, 400, 411
I just have to tell you can only react to what Im doing feeling getting responses from people, 411, 429
And you know I feel great that we have the level of enthusiasm that we do and we also have a really good team on the ground that has been working for months to make sure that its not just here today gone tomorrow, 429, 473
But people are involved, 473, 477
They are really reached out to and yes we believe theyre going to come caucus, 477, 492
So you know the speculation and all the rest of it is entertaining I admit that, 492, 508
But were just going to keep moving forward and do the work that we think is going to be successful on February 1st."  Are you worried that experience your long resume is not an asset in this wild year? " No Im really not, 508, 552
Because I think at the end of the day people take this vote seriously, 552, 566
They know theyre voting for who they prefer to be the next president and commander in chief and I believe that when I am out there talking with people about what we have to go up against here at home get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top begin to raise incomes which hasnt happened deal with health care going from 90 percent coverage which is what we have under the Affordable Care Act now to 100 percent and I lay out what intend to do to get there." "I can only tell you they see people nodding, 566, 668
I know people are signing up as they leave my events, 668, 679
Thats what matters here, 679, 683
Its very personal and people look and they think can we imagine this person to be president and commander in chief? And because of my experience particularly my years as secretary of state working with President Obama I think thats something that people really take into account." " What are you willing to—you know its interesting your husband used a lot of political capital—you and your husband used a lot of political capital to do health care, 683, 760
President Obama arguably used all of his political capital to get health care passed." "What is it? What is the one issue you are going to be willing to use all your political capital to focus on? You and I both know you basically have one big shot at one big issue, 760, 812
What is it that youre willing to use all your political capital to do with?" " Well Chuck first of all I dont agree with you on that, 812, 840
I think that there are several really important issues health care being one of them, 840, 855
Weve got to get costs down, 855, 861
I met a man on Friday who no longer can afford to pay for his HIV medication, 861, 878
I met a woman yesterday whose bill for the drugs she must take and has taken for 25 years has gone from a couple hundred to over $14000 for the same amount of the drug." "That really hits my heart, 878, 918
I know what people are going through, 918, 925
Im going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices cap those prescription drug companies and take that on." "But Im also going to focus on the economy because unless we create more jobs and get incomes rising and fix the tax system so that it doesnt in so many ways tilt toward the wealthy people are not going to get ahead theyre not going to feel theyre getting ahead and theyre going to still believe that the government the economy is rigged against them which is bad for our democracy, 925, 1019
TODD: As you know your opponent Senator Sanders has been hitting you on Wall Street contributions and including some paid speeches that you did for Goldman Sachs among other banks, 1019, 1049
Let me ask you this—why do you think one of these big banks paid you over $200000 for a speech?" " Well look I gave speeches to a wide array of groups from health care groups to auto dealers and many many more and I think what they were interested in because what we talked about was the world coming off of four years as secretary of state in a complicated world people were interested in what I saw what I thought they asked questions about matters that were on their minds, 1049, 1141
A lot of interest in the bin laden raid how such a tough decision was made and what I advised the President, 1141, 1163
You know I think Americans who are doing business in every aspect of the economy want to know more about the world, 1163, 1185
I actually think its a good conversation for people to be having." " You dont think they expect anything in return?"  Absolutely not, 1185, 1208
You know first of all I was a senator from New York, 1208, 1220
I took them on when I was senator, 1220, 1228
I took on the carried interest loophole, 1228, 1235
I took on what was happening in the mortgage markets, 1235, 1245
I was talking about that in 2006, 1245, 1252
They know exactly where I stand, 1252, 1258
"And Ill tell you Chuck its really interesting to me that now Karl Rove has taken money from the financial interest to run an ad against me to try to influence Democrats not to support me, 1258, 1294
Why? Ask yourself why." Because he knows number one I know what must be done and number two I know how to get it done to make sure that Wall Street writ large not just the banks but the investment banks the hedge funds and everybody else no longer can wreck our economy the way they did in 2008, 1294, 1353
 All right, 1353, 1355
Two more quick questions, 1355, 1359
The "Des Moines Register" editorial in praising you and your experience did bring up the e-mail issue as one of those things that theyre frustrated with how you responded to it, 1359, 1390
"Let me just ask you this question, 1390, 1397
Last week you were asked about the FBI investigation, 1397, 1406
Are you concerned? You said you havent been contacted by them, 1406, 1417
Are you concerned this investigation is taking too long? That its putting an extra cloud over your candidacy and until it gets behind you youre sort of going to have these issues and Michael Bloomberg even cited it as a reason why hes thinking about running." " No Im not concerned because I know what the facts are, 1417, 1475
I never sent or received any material marked classified, 1475, 1484
I cannot control what the Republicans leak and what they are contending, 1484, 1496
And I said it was interesting Chuck—youll as a political observer understand why, 1496, 1509
You know back a couple of months ago Kevin McCarthy spilled the beans that the Benghazi investigation was all about bringing me down something that I suspected but I went ahead testified for 11 hours answered all their questions and even they admitted there was nothing new." "And now Senator Grassley shows up at a Trump rally yesterday in Iowa, 1509, 1569
Hes the chairman of the judiciary committee who has—and his staff have been behind and pushing a lot of these stories and announces hes there for the simple reason to defeat me." "I cant control what the Republicans are doing, 1569, 1609
But I know what the facts are and I will just keep putting them out there, 1609, 1625
This is something that I think is very clear about what happened and I know it will be over and resolved at some point, 1625, 1649
But I cant control what the Republicans and their allies do, 1649, 1660
But I think its important voters know what theyre doing."  And Michael Bloomberg? Your reaction to his potential candidacy? " Hes a good friend of mine and Im going to do the best I can to make sure that I get the nomination and well go from there." " So youre not worried about him getting in?" " Well the way I read what he said is if I didnt get the nomination he might consider it, 1660, 1737
Well Im going to relieve him of that and get the nomination so he doesnt have to." " All right, 1737, 1757
Madam Secretary—stay safe on the trail, 1757, 1763
Well catch up with you soon."  Thank you, 1763, 1771
Good to talk to you, 1771, 1776
 Nice to talk with you, 1776, 1781
