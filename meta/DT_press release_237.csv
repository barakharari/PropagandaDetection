"Yesterday the Trump Campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California, 0, 20
Upon careful review of computer records the inclusion of a potential delegate that had previously been rejected and removed from the campaigns list in February 2016 was discovered, 20, 48
This was immediately corrected and a final list which does not include this individual was submitted for certification." â€“ California State Director Tim Clark , 48, 72
