The silent majority is back, 0, 5
In 10 days we are going to win the state of Arizona and we are going to win back the White House, 5, 27
A Trump Administration will immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare, 27, 40
"Its just been announced that the citizens of Arizona are going to experience a 116 percent increase in their Obamacare premiums, 40, 61
Elect me and WE WILL STOP THE PREMIUM HIKES FOR GOOD, 61, 72
WE WILL STOP THE MADNESS OF OBAMACARE." "Every single one of Arizonas 15 counties is losing insurers next year because of Obamacare, 72, 94
In Phoenix there are 8 Obamacare insurers this year, 94, 103
Next year there will be only one, 103, 110
And it was announced this week that Obamacare premiums in Phoenix will go up 145% next year, 110, 127
One insurer in the state will have a $14000 deductible." Obamacare is a catastrophe for Arizona and a catastrophe for all of America, 127, 150
Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world" where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half." In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent the Democratic Governor has said "the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable." Jonathan Gruber the architect of Obamacare admitted it was all a fraud and he said outrageously that it was passed because of the "stupidity of the American voter." Hillary Clinton wants to double-down on Obamacare making it even more expensive, 150, 241
"My Contract With the American Voter outlines a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare and Im asking for your vote so we can save healthcare for every family in Arizona." Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, 241, 282
As you have heard it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton, 282, 307
"This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate and it is everybodys deepest hope that justice at last can be delivered." Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles, 307, 340
Her criminal action was willful deliberate intentional and purposeful, 340, 349
Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure – and exposure, 349, 369
"She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk and put the safety and security of your children at risk, 369, 397
But she didnt care – as long as she and Bill got the money the safety of your family didnt matter." To cover-up her crimes she bleached and deleted 33000 emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer lied to Congress under oath lied to the FBI many times and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing, 397, 463
The WikiLeaks revelations have exposed criminal corruption at the highest levels of our government, 463, 477
"Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and if she ever got the chance shed put the Oval Office up for sale too, 477, 504
Shed put it up for sale to special interests and foreign dictators – whoever offers the highest price." "Yet now its reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI – thats because the Department of Justice is trying to protect Hillary Clinton." "97% of Department of Justice employees presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton." There are those and I happen to be one of them who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General if she were to become President, 504, 588
Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was arranging when he met with Attorney General Lynch on her airplane on the tarmac right here in Arizona, 588, 613
This is what we mean when we say the system is rigged, 613, 625
A vote for Hillary is a vote to surrender our government to public corruption graft and cronyism that threatens the survival of our Constitutional system itself, 625, 651
"What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws and that we are all equal under those laws – Hillarys corruption shreds the principle on which our nation was founded." Government corruption spreads outward like a cancer infecting the whole operation of our government, 651, 698
When the outcome is fixed when the system is rigged people lose hope – they stop dreaming they stop trying, 698, 718
When the powerful can get away with anything because they have the money and the connections to rig the system then people lose confidence in our laws and in our future, 718, 749
"Hillarys corruption is corrosive to the soul of our nation and it must be stopped." As FDR once said "government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob." Hillary believes money and power – not truth and justice – should rule the day, 749, 796
"We have one ultimate check on Hillarys corruption and that is the power of voting, 796, 811
The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions including millions of people voting for the first time in their entire lives." Vote with all of your heart and soul to Make America Great Again, 811, 855
Restoring honesty to our government and the rule of law to our society will be my highest priority as President, 855, 875
"Havent we had enough drama with the Clintons? Bill Clinton was impeached for lying and obstructing justice signed the worst trade deal in history NAFTA which emptied our country of its manufacturing jobs and he doesnt even have the right to practice law." Hillary has brought scandal or destroyed everything she touched, 875, 927
Look at Whitewater cattle futures jobs in Upstate New York or look at Syria Iraq Libya and now her emails, 927, 947
This will be the year the American people say: enough is enough, 947, 959
This will be the year the American people break with the bitter failures of the past and embrace a new and optimistic future, 959, 982
My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption, 982, 996
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we are all about to say, 996, 1016
When we win on November 8th We Are Going To Washington D.C, 1016, 1028
And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP, 1028, 1036
At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs, 1036, 1050
Right now 70 million American women and children live in poverty or near the brink of poverty, 1050, 1067
"America has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillarys NAFTA, 1067, 1080
America has lost 70000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization." "We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 1080, 1106
Hillarys goal is to send millions and millions more jobs out of our country." Hillary is going to raise taxes up to 45 percent massively expand regulation shut down American energy and push through terrible trade deals that offshore our jobs for the benefit of her donors, 1106, 1153
Her policies will cause a major recession or even a depression, 1153, 1164
A Trump Administration will stop TPP renegotiate NAFTA and we are going to stand up to China on Currency Manipulation, 1164, 1184
We are going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent, 1184, 1199
We are going to cut taxes for Middle Class families by hundreds of billions of dollars, 1199, 1215
My infrastructure plan will provide help for projects like the proposed Interstate-11 which would connect Phoenix with Las Vegas and other areas, 1215, 1237
We will also unleash the full power of American energy including shale oil natural gas and clean coal, 1237, 1255
We will become a rich nation once again, 1255, 1263
But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country, 1263, 1276
A Trump Administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States, 1276, 1290
And yes we will build a wall, 1290, 1297
"We have the endorsement of Americas ICE and Border Patrol Officers the first time they have ever made an endorsement." "When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State she allowed thousands of the most dangerous criminal aliens in the world to go free inside America because their home countries wouldnt take them back." These were people guilty of murder assault rape and all manner of violent crime, 1297, 1363
Hillary has pledged "open borders" and supports Sanctuary Cities, 1363, 1372
"Countless Americans are killed by illegal immigrants because our government wont do its job." "These include amazing Americans like Sergeant Brandon Mendoza of Mesa Arizona who was killed by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record who should have been deported – but the government refused to act, 1372, 1420
Ive spent time with his incredible mother." 28-year-old Park Ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed by a drug cartel hit squad responsible for a number of murders, 1420, 1448
Kris died trying to protect our borders from drug and weapon trafficking into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, 1448, 1467
33-year-old Phoenix Police Officer Nick Erfle a young cancer survivor was murdered by a previously- deported illegal immigrant with a felony warrant, 1467, 1489
Nick was shot twice in the back of the head, 1489, 1499
21-year-old Grant Ronnebeck was working at a convenience store in Mesa Arizona when he was shot point blank by an illegal immigrant, 1499, 1521
His illegal immigrant killer despite a criminal record was out on bond roaming free, 1521, 1535
When I become President this crime wave ends, 1535, 1543
We are going to cancel all federal funding for Sanctuary Cities, 1543, 1554
We are going to impose tough prison sentences for illegal immigrants who return after a previous deportation, 1554, 1571
We will end illegal immigration deport every last criminal alien and save American lives, 1571, 1585
We will also repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military, 1585, 1599
We have the endorsements of over 200 Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor Recipients, 1599, 1615
Our Air Force is the smallest and oldest it has ever been and my plan builds the modern advanced fighter aircraft we need – fighters like those that will be stationed at Luke Air Force Base, 1615, 1651
"Our Army is the smallest it has been since before World War II and we will significantly increase both the size of our Army and the emphasis we place on intelligence – that means supporting the men and women at Fort Huachuca home of the Armys Intelligence Center." "Places like Marine Corps Air Station Yuma will have new aircraft – they wont have to get spare parts from museums anymore." We also need a new foreign policy that puts America First, 1651, 1732
"Hillarys policies unleashed ISIS empowered Iran and spread death and destruction across the Middle East." "Hillary and our failed Washington Establishment have spent $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East and now its in worse shape than ever before." "Our failed establishment has betrayed the American worker and family, 1732, 1782
Theyve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe they have left our borders wide open at home and theyve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries." To all Americans I say: it is time for new leadership, 1782, 1824
Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days – We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; cancel every illegal Obama executive order; stop the massive inflow of refugees and keep Radical Islamic Terrorist out of our country; rebuild our military and take care of our Vets; reduce surging crime and support the men and women of law enforcement; provide school choice and put an end to Common Core; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1824, 1928
Americans are tired of being told by politicians that they have to defer their dreams to another day but they really mean another decade, 1928, 1952
"Hillary has been there for 30 years and she has accomplished nothing – shes just made things worse." She is the candidate of yesterday, 1952, 1976
We are the movement of the future, 1976, 1983
Our movement represents all Americans from all backgrounds and all walks of life, 1983, 1996
We are asking for the votes of Republicans Democrats Independents and first-time voters, 1996, 2009
We are fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests, 2009, 2030
We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who yearns for a better future, 2030, 2051
"With your vote we are just 10 days away from the change youve been waiting for your entire life." Together We Will Make America JUST Again, 2051, 2077
We Will Make America Strong Again, 2077, 2083
We Will Make America Safe Again, 2083, 2089
And We Will Make America Great Again, 2089, 2096
