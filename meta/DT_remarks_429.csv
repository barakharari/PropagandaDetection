And I mean it from the heart and Id like to just read it and I think youll understand it maybe better than I do in certain ways, 52, 80
"For centuries the African-American church has been the conscience of our country, 80, 92
So true, 92, 94
Its from the pews and pulpits and Christian teachings of black churches all across this land that the Civil Rights movement lifted up its soul and lifted up the soul of our nation, 94, 127
Its from these pews that our nation has been inspired toward a better moral character a deeper concern for mankind and spirit of charity and unity that binds us all together, 127, 158
And were bound together and I see that today, 158, 167
This has been an amazing day for me, 167, 175
"The African-American faith community has been one of Gods greatest gifts to America and to its people, 175, 192
There is perhaps no action our leaders can take that would do more to heal our country and support our people than to provide a greater platform to the Black churches and church-goers, 192, 225
You do right everyday by your community and your families, 225, 235
You raise children in the Light of God; I will always support your church always, 235, 250
And defend your right to worship , 250, 256
so important, 256, 258
"I am here today to listen to your message and I hope that my presence here will also help your voice to reach new audiences in our country and many of these audiences desperately need your spirit and your thought, 258, 298
I can tell you that, 298, 303
"Christian faith is not the past but the present and the future, 303, 315
Make it stronger, 315, 318

And how to put every American on the ladder of success, 513, 524
A great education a great job, 524, 530
But today I just want to let you know that I am here to listen to you and I have been doing that, 530, 553
And we had a fantastic interview with Bishop Jackson, 553, 562
It was really an amazing interview, 562, 568
He is better than the people who do that professionally, 568, 578
I will tell you, 578, 582
Its true, 582, 584
Its true, 584, 586
Its true, 586, 588
Hes better, 588, 590
"And I didnt really know what I was getting into, 590, 600
I didnt know, 600, 603
Is this going to be nice? Is this going to be wild? Hes a great gentleman and a very smart guy, 603, 624
I just hope you dont lose him to Hollywood, 624, 633
Thats the only problem, 633, 637
And especially and especially Dr, 637, 642
Jackson she may be gone, 642, 647
Hollywood is calling, 647, 650
Look at all those television cameras back there, 650, 658
Look at all the television cameras, 658, 664
Im sorry to do that to you Bishop, 664, 672
Because its just one of those things right? "Our nation is too divided, 672, 685
We talk past each other not to each other and those who seek office do not do enough to step into the community and learn what is going on, 685, 714
They dont know, 714, 717
They have no clue, 717, 721
Im here today to learn, 721, 726
So that we can together remedy injustice in any form, 726, 736
And so that we can also remedy economics so that the African-American community can benefit economically through jobs and income and so many other different ways, 736, 762
"Our political system has failed the people and works only to enrich itself, 762, 775
I want to reform that system so that it works for you everyone in this room, 775, 791
I believe true reform can only come from outside the system, 791, 802
I really mean that, 802, 806
Being a businessman is much different than being a politician because I understand what is happening, 806, 822
And we are going outside the establishment, 822, 829
"Becoming the nominee of the Party of Abraham Lincoln — a lot of people dont realize that Abraham Lincoln the great Abraham Lincoln was a Republican — has been the greatest honor of my life, 829, 864
It is on his legacy that I hope to build the future of the Party but more important the future of the country and the community, 864, 890
"I believe that we need a Civil Rights agenda for our time, 890, 902
One that ensures the rights to a great education — so important — and the right to live in safety and in peace and to have a really really great job, 902, 933
A good paying job and one that you love going to every morning, 933, 946
That can happen, 946, 949
We need to bring our companies back, 949, 956
"It also means the right to have a government that protects our works and fights really fights for our jobs, 956, 976
I want to help you build and rebuild Detroit, 976, 985
And we can do that especially with people like Bishop Jackson and Dr, 985, 998
Jackson, 998, 999
I mean that, 999, 1002
Its been an amazing experience, 1002, 1007
Its been an amazing experience, 1007, 1012
Really, 1012, 1013
"Nothing is more sad than when we sideline young black men with unfulfilled potential tremendous potential, 1013, 1029
I met some people this morning that are incredible people and theyre looking for jobs, 1029, 1044
These are incredible people , 1044, 1048
young people, 1048, 1050
Our whole country loses out when were unable to harness the brilliance and the energy of these folks "Were one nation and when anyone hurts we all hurt together, 1050, 1079
That is so true, 1079, 1083
So true, 1083, 1085
"Were all brothers and sisters and were all created by the same God, 1085, 1098
We must love each other and support each other and we are in this all together, 1098, 1114
All together, 1114, 1116
"I fully understand that the African-American community has suffered from discrimination and that there are many wrongs that must still be made right and they will be right, 1116, 1144
I want America prosperous for everyone, 1144, 1150
I want to make this city the economic envy of the world and we can do that, 1150, 1167
We can do that again, 1167, 1172
"Factories everywhere new roads and bridges new schools — especially schools — and new hope, 1172, 1187
"I have been so greatly blessed and in so many ways with no greater blessing than my family, 1187, 1205
Ive had a great family, 1205, 1210
"Nothing would make me happier and more fulfilled than to use what I have learned in business and in traveling all over the world — Ive sort of seen a lot — to bring the wealth and prosperity and opportunity to those who have not had these opportunities before, 1210, 1259
And thats many many people in Detroit, 1259, 1266
"When I see wages falling people out of work I know the hardships this inflicts and I am determined to do something about it, 1266, 1290
I will do something about it, 1290, 1296
I do get things done I will tell you, 1296, 1305
Some people have strengths thats one of my strengths I get things done, 1305, 1318
Im going to get things done for you, 1318, 1326
"Please know this for any who are hurting things are going to turn around.Tomorrow will be better, 1326, 1343
Much better, 1343, 1345
The Pastor and I were talking about riding up the street how we see all those closed stores and people sitting down on the sidewalk and no jobs and no activity, 1345, 1376
Well get it turned around, 1376, 1381
Well get it turned around Pastor, 1381, 1387
Believe me, 1387, 1389
"Were going to win again as a country and were going to win again for all of our people, 1389, 1408
I want to work with you to renew the bonds of trust between citizens and the bonds of faith that make our nation strong, 1408, 1432
America has been lifted out of many of its most difficult hours through the miracle of faith and through people like Bishop Jackson and Dr, 1432, 1457
Jackson, 1457, 1458
So important, 1458, 1460
People have no idea how important they are, 1460, 1468
"Now in these hard times for our country let us turn again to our Christian heritage to lift up the soul of our nation, 1468, 1492
I am so deeply grateful to be here today and it is my prayer that the America of tomorrow — and I mean that — that the America oftomorrow will be one of unity togetherness and peace, 1492, 1529
And perhaps we can add the word prosperity, 1529, 1537
Ok? Prosperity, 1537, 1539
"Id like to conclude with a passage from 1 John Chapter 4, 1539, 1551
You know it? See most groups I speak to dont know that, 1551, 1563
But we know it, 1563, 1567
If you want we can say it together: No one has ever seen God but if we love one another God lives in us and His love is made complete in us, 1567, 1599
And that is so true, 1599, 1604
"Thank you very much, 1604, 1608
This has been such an honor, 1608, 1614
Thank you very much, 1614, 1618
