Thank you it is so great to be here in Florida, 0, 11
In 26 days we are going to win the state and we are going to win the White House, 11, 30
Our movement is about replacing a failed and corrupt political establishment with a new government controlled by you the American People, 30, 51
There is nothing the political establishment will not do and no lie they will not tell to hold on to their prestige and power at your expense, 51, 78
The Washington establishment and the financial and media corporations that fund it exists for only one reason: to protect and enrich itself, 78, 100
"The establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election, 100, 111
As an example just one single trade deal theyd like to pass involves trillions of dollars controlled by many countries corporations and lobbyists." For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests they partner with our campaign represents an existential threat, 111, 159
This is not simply another 4-year election, 159, 166
This is a crossroads in the history of our civilization that will determine whether or not We The People reclaim control over our government, 166, 190
The political establishment that is trying everything to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled this country dry, 190, 224
The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico China and other countries throughout the world, 224, 250
Our just-announced jobs numbers are anemic and our gross domestic product or GDP is barely above one percent, 250, 268
Workers in the United States were making less than they were almost 20 years ago – and yet they are working harder, 268, 290
"Its a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities." Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint Michigan – and rural towns in Pennsylvania Ohio North Carolina and across our country, 290, 360
They have stripped these towns bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs, 360, 377
"The Clinton Machine is at the center of this power structure, 377, 388
Weve seen this firsthand in the WikiLeaks documents in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S, 388, 412
sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers." And likewise the emails show that the Clinton Machine is so closely and irrevocably tied to media organizations that she is given the questions and answers in advance of her debates, 412, 452
Clinton is also given approval and veto power over quotes written about her in the New York Times, 452, 470
And the emails show the reporters collaborate and conspire directly with the Clinton Campaign on helping her win the election, 470, 490
"With their control over our government at stake with trillions of dollars on the line the Clinton Machine is determined to achieve the destruction of our campaign which has now become a movement the likes of which our country has never seen before – and we wont let them do that." "The most powerful weapon deployed by the Clintons is the corporate media, 490, 553
Lets be clear on one thing: the corporate media in our country is no longer involved in journalism, 553, 571
They are a political special interest no different than any lobbyist or other financial entity with an agenda, 571, 589
And their agenda is to elect the Clintons at any cost at any price no matter how many lives they destroy." For them it is a war – and for them nothing is out of bounds, 589, 625
This is a struggle for the survival of our nation, 625, 635
This election will determine whether we are a free nation or whether we have only the illusion of Democracy but are in fact controlled by a small handful of global special interests rigging the system, 635, 670
This is not just conspiracy but reality and you and I know it, 670, 683
The establishment and their media enablers wield control over this nation through means that are well known, 683, 700
Anyone who challenges their control is deemed a sexist a racist a xenophobe and morally deformed, 700, 716
They will attack you they will slander you they will seek to destroy your career and reputation, 716, 733
And they will lie lie and lie even more, 733, 742
The Clintons are criminals, 742, 746
This is well-documented and the establishment that protects them has engaged in a massive cover-up of widespread criminal activity at the State Department and Clinton Foundation in order to keep the Clintons in power, 746, 780
Never in history have we seen such a cover-up as this one that includes the destruction of 33000 emails 13 phones laptops missing boxes of evidence and on and on, 780, 810
People who are capable of such crimes against our nation are capable of anything, 810, 824
And so now we address the slander and libels that was just last night thrown at me by the Clinton Machine the New York Times and other media outlets as part of a concerted coordinated and vicious attack, 824, 862
It is not coincidence that these attacks come at the exact same moment and all together at the same time as the WikiLeaks documents expose the massive international corruption of the Clinton Machine – including 2000 more emails this morning "These claims about me of inappropriate conduct with women are totally and absolutely false – and the Clinton Machine knows it is, 862, 924
Its all fabricated, 924, 927
Its pure fiction and outright lies, 927, 933
These events never happened, 933, 937
The claims are preposterous ludicrous and defy truth common sense and logic." We already have substantial evidence to dispute these lies and it will be made public in the appropriate way and at the appropriate time, 937, 973
These lies come from outlets whose past stories and past claims have already been discredited, 973, 988
The media outlets did not even attempt to confirm the most basic facts because even a simple investigation would have shown these are false smears, 988, 1013
"Whats happening to me is no different than what happened to other innocent people like the story written in Rolling Stone Magazine – and that magazine should be put out of business." Six months ago the New York Times wrote a massive story attacking me and the central witness they used said the story was false that she was quoted inaccurately, 1013, 1074
She said I was a great guy and never made those remarks, 1074, 1086
We demanded a retraction but they refused to print it – just like they refused to print the comments from another source who praised me in her book or the words of another wonderful woman who said nice things, 1086, 1125
That story was a fraud and an embarrassment to the New York Times, 1125, 1138
It will be part of the lawsuit we are preparing against them, 1138, 1150
Now today the same two discredited writers who should have been fired from the times tell a totally fabricated and false story that supposedly took place on an airplane more than 30 years ago – another ridiculous tale no witnesses no nothing, 1150, 1192
"Also a writer from people magazine who wrote a story on Melania and myself on our first anniversary, 1192, 1210
The story was lovely but last night we hear after 12 years a new claim that I made inappropriate advances, 1210, 1230
I ask a very simple question why wasnt it part of the story that appeared 12 years ago? I was one of the biggest stars on television and it would have been one of the biggest stories of the year, 1230, 1270
Take a look at her words, 1270, 1276
It would have been the headline, 1276, 1282
No it only appears 26 days before the election." This invented account has already been debunked by eyewitness testimony – the very witness identified by the author has said the story is entirely false, 1282, 1316
This weekend the New York Times published a full-page hit piece with another claim from an individual who has been totally discredited based on the emails and letters she has sent to our office over the years, 1316, 1353
But the New York Times refused to use the evidence we presented them, 1353, 1366
Others have likewise were presented with this story but after seeing the evidence we provided refused to print it, 1366, 1385
"This is part of a concerted effort led by the New York Times which is fighting desperately for its relevance and survival and which probably wont even be around in a few years based on its financial outlook has become more and more vicious and vile." I will not allow the Clinton Machine to turn this campaign into a discussion of their slanders and lies but will remain focused on the issues facing the American people, 1385, 1461
But let me state this as clearly as I can, 1461, 1471
These attacks are orchestrated by the Clintons and their media allies, 1471, 1482
They are false and slanderous in every respect, 1482, 1490
We are now less than a month from the most important election of our lifetime – indeed one the most important elections in modern history – and the polls show us in a dead heat, 1490, 1525
And the new Rasmussen poll shows us 2 points ahead, 1525, 1535
So now the Clinton Machine has put forward a small handful of people out of the tens of thousands I have met worked with and employed – in order to make wild and false allegations that fail to meet even the most basic test of common sense, 1535, 1582
Again this is nothing more than an attempt to destroy our movement and for the Clintons to keep their corrupt control over this government, 1582, 1606
When I declared my candidacy I knew what bad shape our country was in, 1606, 1620
I had seen firsthand the corruption and the sickness that has taken over our politics, 1620, 1635
I knew they would throw every lie they could at me and my family and my loved ones, 1635, 1653
I knew they would stop at nothing to try to stop me, 1653, 1665
But I take all of these slings and arrows for you, 1665, 1676
I take them for our movement so that we can have our country back, 1676, 1690
Our great civilization here in America and across the civilized world has come upon a moment of reckoning, 1690, 1708
"Weve seen it in the United Kingdom where they voted to liberate themselves from global government and global trade deals and global immigration deals that have destroyed their sovereignty." But the central base of world political power is here in America and it is our corrupt political establishment that is the greatest power behind the efforts at radical globalization and the disenfranchisement of working people, 1708, 1773
Their financial resources are unlimited, 1773, 1778
Their political resources are unlimited, 1778, 1783
Their media resources are unlimited, 1783, 1788
And most importantly the depths of their immorality is unlimited, 1788, 1798
Our political establishment has no soul, 1798, 1804
I knew these false attacks would come, 1804, 1811
I knew this day would arrive, 1811, 1817
And I knew the American people would rise above it and vote for the future they deserve, 1817, 1834
The only thing that can stop the Corrupt Clinton Machine is you, 1834, 1846
The only force strong enough to save this country is you, 1846, 1857
The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you the American People, 1857, 1873
They control the Department of Justice and they even clandestinely meet with the Attorney General of the United States – in the back of her airplane while on the runway – for 39 minutes – to most likely discuss her reappointment in a Clinton Administration just prior to the Attorney General making a decision over whether or not to prosecute Hillary Clinton, 1873, 1935
"Likewise they have corrupted the Director of the FBI to the point at which stories are already saying the great men and women who work for the FBI are embarrassed and ashamed to what hes done to one of our great institutions, 1935, 1977
Hillary Clinton is guilty of all of the things that Director Comey stated at his press conference and Congressional hearings and far more – and yet he let her off the hook while others lives are being destroyed for far less." This is a conspiracy against you the American people, 1977, 2027
This is our moment of reckoning as a society and as a civilization, 2027, 2040
"I didnt need to do this, 2040, 2046
I built a great company and I had a wonderful life, 2046, 2057
I could have enjoyed the benefits of years of successful business for myself and my family instead of going through this absolute horror show of lies deceptions and malicious attacks, 2057, 2087
Im doing it because this country has given me so much and I feel strongly it was my turn to give back." Some people warned me this campaign would be a journey to hell, 2087, 2121
But they are wrong it will be a journey to heaven because we will help so many people, 2121, 2139
"In my former life I was an insider as much as anybody else – and I know whats like to be an insider, 2139, 2162
Now I am being punished for leaving their special club and revealing to you their great scam, 2162, 2179
Because I used to be part of the club Im the only one who can fix it, 2179, 2196
Im doing this for the people and this movement is just right – and we will take back this country for you and Make America Great Again." The corrupt establishment knows that we are an existential threat to their criminal enterprise, 2196, 2237
They know that if we win their power is gone and returned to you, 2237, 2251
The clouds hanging over our government can be lifted and replaced with a bright future – but it all depends on whether we let the New York Times decide our future or whether we let the American people decide our future, 2251, 2292
If this Clinton Campaign of Destruction is allowed to work then no other highly successful person – which is what our country needs – will ever again run for this office, 2292, 2323
I will not lie to you, 2323, 2329
These false attacks hurt, 2329, 2333
To be lied about to be slandered to be smeared so publicly and before your family is painful, 2333, 2351
What the Clinton Machine is doing to me and my family is egregious beyond words, 2351, 2366
It is reprehensible beyond description, 2366, 2371
"But I also know its not about me – its about all of you, 2371, 2385
Its about all of us together as a country." "Its about the Veterans who need medical care the mothers whove lost children to terrorism and crime its about the inner cities and the border towns who desperately need our help its about the millions of jobless Americans, 2385, 2432
This election is about the people being crushed by Obamacare and its about defeating ISIS and appointing Supreme Court Justices who will defend our Constitution." "This election is also about the African-American and Hispanic communities whose communities have been plunged into crime poverty and failing schools by the policies of Hillary Clinton, 2432, 2484
Theyve robbed these citizens of their future and I will give them their hope jobs and opportunities back, 2484, 2502
I will deliver." This election is about every man woman and child in our country who deserves to live in safety prosperity and peace, 2502, 2526
We will rise above the lies the smears and the ludicrous slanders from ludicrous reporters, 2526, 2541
We will vote for the country we want, 2541, 2549
We will vote for the future we want, 2549, 2557
We will vote for the politics we want, 2557, 2565
We will vote to put this corrupt government cartel out of business, 2565, 2577
We will remove from our politics the special interests who have betrayed our workers our borders our freedoms and our sovereign rights as a nation, 2577, 2602
We will end the politics of profit we will end the rule of special interests we will put a stop to the raiding of our country – and the disenfranchisement of our people, 2602, 2635
Our Independence Day is at hand and it arrives finally on November 8th, 2635, 2648
Join me in taking back our country and creating a bright and glorious new dawn for our people, 2648, 2666
