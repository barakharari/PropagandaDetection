"Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual, 0, 7
He is the single biggest liar Ive ever come across in politics or otherwise and I have seen some of the best of them, 7, 31
His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous, 31, 39
It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much." Cruz said I would be appointing a liberal judge when in fact I will appoint a great conservative and I am the only candidate who has gone so far at the debate as to suggest two individuals I feel would best represent the conservative values we need to protect: William "Bill" Pryor Jr, 39, 113
and Diane Sykes, 113, 116
Cruz says I am pro-choice when in fact I am staunchly pro-life and have been for a long time, 116, 135
Like Ronald Reagan on many issues I have evolved, 135, 144
"Cruz says I am in favor of ObamaCare when in fact I have spoken about repealing and replacing this disaster of a system at every speech throughout my campaign and since its inception, 144, 177
Meanwhile Cruz was responsible for getting Bush to put in the judge that failed to vote against ObamaCare twice." Cruz says I will try to take away your second amendment rights when I am one of the strongest proponents of the right to bear arms and I say so in every speech that I have made for years, 177, 235
I am a proud member of the NRA and so are my sons, 235, 248
Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign, 248, 275
In Iowa Cruz told thousands of Ben Carson voters that Dr, 275, 286
Carson had left the race and to instead vote for Ted Cruz, 286, 298
He apologized when the race was over, 298, 305
Likewise his fraudulent voter violation form sent to Iowa voters, 305, 315
If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation I have no choice but to fight back, 315, 334
"One of the ways I can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President, 334, 364
If he doesnt take down his false ads and retract his lies I will do so immediately, 364, 381
Additionally the RNC should intervene and if they dont they are in default of their pledge to me." I am the strongest on the borders and I will build a wall and it will be a real wall, 381, 419
I am strongest on illegal immigration strongest on ISIS strongest on the military and I will take care of our Vets, 419, 440
I will end common core and preserve the second amendment, 440, 450
I will renegotiate our trade deals and bring our jobs back to our country, 450, 464
I am the only person who will Make America Great Again, 464, 475
