 "Thank you so much! Wow it is great to be back in Cincinnati, 0, 13
What a beautiful night on the banks of this magnificent river, 13, 24
I am grateful to all of you, 24, 31
I am thrilled to be here with my dear friends Mark and Gabby and with all of you because there are just eight days left in what is the most important election of our lifetimes, 31, 66
"Are you ready to work hard in this election and win it? Are you ready to send Ted Strickland to the United States Senate? Ive known Ted a long time, 66, 96
He is a champion for workers and families, 96, 104
He knows that Ohio needs more good jobs with rising wages, 104, 115
And he is the kind of person who will actually work to get things done breaking through the gridlock in Washington, 115, 136
And this is important: unlike his opponent Ted Strickland has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump." I also want to thank Mayor John Cranley and State Representative Alicia Reece and all the other elected officials including my friend the Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes from across the river in Kentucky, 136, 190
And we are so fortunate to have two other champions for American families with us today, 190, 206
I am awed by the courage and commitment that both Mark and Gabby bring to their work to do everything they can to help save lives in America, 206, 234
You know as Gabby says every day when she goes out fight fight fight, 234, 248
And fight she does, 248, 252
She fights to make sure that we save lives and we prevent injuries and we do it together – to end the epidemic of gun violence that threatens our children our fellow men and women our country, 252, 289
And Gabby and Mark know something very important: there is a big majority of Americans including a majority of gun owners to stand behind and achieve commonsense gun safety measures, 289, 319
And I am looking forward to working with them as their partner, 319, 331
"You know you go through life you go through the campaigns there are ups and there are downs, 331, 349
And my mother who had a really difficult life she told me something that has stayed with me and certainly has come in handy in this campaign, 349, 376
Everybody gets knocked down; what matters is whether you get back up, 376, 388
And throughout this campaign I have stayed focused on one thing: you – your lives your families the problems that keep you up at night, 388, 413
Because thats really what this election is all about, 413, 422
Its not about the noise and the distractions, 422, 430
Its about what kind of country we want for our kids and what kind of president can help get us there." I have so much that I want to do with you on behalf of Cincinnati and Ohio and America, 430, 470
And whether or not I get the chance to serve you really depends upon what happens in this election, 470, 489
"Now earlier today I was up at Kent State a great university and I told them about some of the reasons why I think its really important to get everybody out to vote in this election, 489, 525
But I started by saying that theres this new email story about – why in the world the FBI would decide to jump into an election without evidence of any wrongdoing with just days to go, 525, 561
Thats a really good question, 561, 566
But I want you to know – look Ive said repeatedly I made a mistake Im not making any excuses but I will tell you this, 566, 592
If they want to look at some more emails of one of my staffers by all means go ahead look at them, 592, 614
And I know they will reach the same conclusion they reached when they looked at my emails last year right? It wasnt even a close call and I think most people have moved on, 614, 648
Theyre looking and focused on okay who is going to be the next president and commander-in-chief?" Did any of you see the debates? Any of you see the debates? Well I am – I got a little bit of a chance, 648, 689
I did stand there for four and a half hours with Donald Trump proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job, 689, 712
But I did occasionally get a chance to ask people to take a look at my 30 years of public service my plans for our country what Tim Kaine and I have said we want to do and then weigh that against my opponent what hes done and said, 712, 761
I am running against someone who says he doesnt understand why we cant use nuclear weapons, 761, 777
He actually said "Then why are we making them?" He wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, 777, 794
Hes mentioned Japan South Korea even Saudi Arabia, 794, 802
Now if you are hoping that he might surround himself with good people who would stop his crazy ideas remember this, 802, 823
When he was asked who he consults with on foreign policy Donald Trump said he didnt need to consult because and I quote "I have a very good brain." He said he knows more about ISIS than our generals do, 823, 863
 " No Donald you dont, 863, 868
And of course the people that Donald Trump has around him include two men whose activities are also reportedly being investigated because of their ties to Russia Vladimir Putin and their allies." "So in these last days lets not get distracted from the real choice in this election, 868, 916
Donald Trump has proven himself to be temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be president and commander-in-chief." "I have to tell you it does not give me any pleasure saying that, 916, 947
Its not a small thing, 947, 952
I have watched and known a lot of the people who have run for president both Republicans and Democrats, 952, 971
And look Ive had my disagreements with Republicans, 971, 979
I might have disagreed on policies or principles but I never doubted their fitness to serve in this office, 979, 998
Donald Trump is different and thats why there is so much at stake in this election, 998, 1014
He has a dark and divisive vision for America that could tear our country apart, 1014, 1029
Abraham Lincoln understood a house divided against itself cannot stand and that was over the greatest of challenges – the challenge posed by slavery – and we fought a civil war, 1029, 1060
But we also have to take stock of how divided we are today the kinds of divisions that need to be healed to bring people together." "I will tell you this, 1060, 1091
I want to bring not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents people who vote for me and people who vote against me together, 1091, 1114
Because I have a very different vision of America, 1114, 1123
Instead of dark and divisive its hopeful and inclusive, 1123, 1132
Its big-hearted not small-minded, 1132, 1136
It is about lifting people up not putting them down, 1136, 1146
Its a vision that says and I believe this with all my heart we are stronger together, 1146, 1163
And America is great because America is good, 1163, 1171
Never forget that, 1171, 1174
Yes we have our flaws; of course were only humans, 1174, 1184
But what we have done over the course of our history to keep widening the circle of opportunity and equality and freedom is unlike any other place in the history of the world, 1184, 1217
So we want an America where women are respected – where our veterans are honored – where parents and families are supported and workers are paid fairly, 1217, 1244
And we believe in an America where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong, 1244, 1259
An America that leads in the world and lives up to our values where everyone counts everyone has a place and the American dream is big enough for everybody, 1259, 1288
So the choice could not be clearer and the stakes could not be higher." "When I was at Kent State talking about the threats that Donald Trump poses to our national security I was really struck, 1288, 1324
It was a very big crowd and it was primarily students, 1324, 1335
And I thought to myself well Im not going to give a rah-rah speech because I really want to talk about what this means to national security, 1335, 1362
And I was introduced by a gentleman named Bruce Blair a former Air Force officer in charge of the nuclear codes and keys, 1362, 1385
A launch officer, 1385, 1388
And he came out for me along with now more than 30 launch officers and basically they said we cannot support Donald Trump because he should never ever be near the nuclear codes and keys." And even the prospect of an actual nuclear war doesnt seem to bother him, 1388, 1437
"Good luck, 1437, 1439
Enjoy yourselves folks" is what he had to say about a potential nuclear conflict in Asia, 1439, 1455
I wonder if he even knows that a single – a single – nuclear warhead can kill millions of people? That is why dozens of retired nuclear launch officers took the unprecedented step of saying that Donald should and I quote "not have his finger on the button." And when it comes to handling a crisis weve seen in this campaign that Donald Trump loses his cool at the slightest provocation – when hes gotten a tough question from a reporter or when hes challenged in a debate or when he sees a protestor at a rally when hes confronted by his own words, 1455, 1559
So imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis, 1559, 1570
 " Imagine him plunging us into a war because somebody got under his very thin skin, 1570, 1586
I hope youll think about that when you cast your vote in this election, 1586, 1600
Think about what it takes to lead in a very complicated world and in whose hands you want to put the safety of our children and grandchildren." "And think about the difference between electing a president who will do nothing and president who will tackle the epidemic of gun violence in America, 1600, 1652
As Gabby knows so well 33000 Americans a year are killed guns, 1652, 1664
Thousands more are injured, 1664, 1668
Its an average of 90 people a day dying, 1668, 1677
Here in Ohio more people are killed by guns than die in car crashes, 1677, 1691
We have seen moviegoers gunned down in theaters little children killed in their classrooms clubgoers massacred in Orlando nine faithful people murdered at Bible study in Charleston South Carolina, 1691, 1720
And weve seen far too many young African American men and women killed by gun violence which is now the leading cause of death for young black men, 1720, 1748
And when we think about that we think of Dontre Hamilton or Jordan Davis or Trayvon Martin and others, 1748, 1767
Ive had the great honor of getting to know their mothers who have turned their grief into action and their mourning into a movement." "But heres what I want to say, 1767, 1798
If anything else in our country were killing as many people people of good faith people who believe like we do in the Second Amendment people who own guns people who go hunting people who are collectors we would say hey wait a minute, 1798, 1842
This cant go on, 1842, 1846
We need comprehensive background checks to close the gun show loophole close the online loophole, 1846, 1861
And we know here in Ohio a majority of gun owners support these common-sense steps to prevent gun violence because they know we can respect the Second Amendment and keep our kids and communities safe at the same time, 1861, 1900
And we need to keep guns out of the hands suspected terrorists, 1900, 1912
If you are too dangerous to fly you are too dangerous to buy a gun period." "And look, 1912, 1930
There is a very clear difference, 1930, 1936
Donald Trump wont stand up to the gun lobby, 1936, 1945
Hes sold out to them, 1945, 1950
In fact the gun lobby is spending more on ads to get Donald Trump elected than any other group more than $7 million in Ohio alone, 1950, 1976
And in return Donald Trump has promised to repeat President Obamas actions to strengthen criminal background checks, 1976, 1993
Donald says guns should be allowed in nightclubs that serve alcohol, 1993, 2004
Hes even said on his very first day in office he would require every school in America to let people carry guns into our classrooms, 2004, 2029
How can anyone think our schools would be safer with more guns?" "So I have stood up to the gun lobby for years which is why they are running all of these ads against me, 2029, 2064
And I will stand up to them as president, 2064, 2073
I will work with Gabby and Mark and Americans for Responsible Solutions to pass common sense reforms because weve got to keep guns out of the wrong hands and help save lives." "I will also get up every day in the White House working my heart out for you whatever I can do to knock down barriers to empower people to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top, 2073, 2146
Thats how I was raised, 2146, 2151
I was raised to believe that if you work hard – and I believe in hard work – you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America, 2151, 2181
And I will never ever quit on you, 2181, 2189
When I tell you Im going to try to do something that will make a positive difference in your life I dont care what the political or other barriers are, 2189, 2219
Were going to find a way over under around or through until we get it done, 2219, 2235
Ive been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and Im not stopping now, 2235, 2250
Remember when our opponents go low we go high, 2250, 2259
Were not going to be distracted, 2259, 2265
Were not going to be knocked off course, 2265, 2273
We know how much this election matters, 2273, 2280
And everything all of you can do between now and the time that the polls close is going to really count." "Now the Donald Trump campaign strategy is pretty simple, 2280, 2310
Theyve announced it, 2310, 2313
Their strategy is: get women to stay home get young people to stay home and get people of color to stay home, 2313, 2335
Its all part of his scorched-earth campaign but it actually adds up to more than half of our whole population when you stop to think about it, 2335, 2362
And it goes against everything we stand for, 2362, 2370
So if youre as upset as I am by the campaign that he has run the things he has said insulting not just women but immigrants Latinos African Americans prisoners of war Muslims veterans the military – I mean the list goes on and on, 2370, 2415
Its almost impossible to understand how somebody could run for president who seems not to like America as much as he does." "So you know the best way to stop him: by showing up with the biggest turnout in history, 2415, 2455
We need more Americans to vote, 2455, 2461
And I think we have a chance to get more Americans from all walks of life to vote because were already seeing record turnout, 2461, 2485
Twenty-three million people have already voted in this election, 2485, 2494
And more than one million of them are right here in Ohio, 2494, 2506
There is no doubt if we vote we win, 2506, 2515
So please if you havent voted early please do so, 2515, 2525
And please get your friends and your family everybody you know to vote, 2525, 2538
Take people to vote with you, 2538, 2544
Try to help those who might have a little problem getting there." "Make sure that everybody you know understands early voting has begun, 2544, 2567
And you can go to iwillvote.com to find your nearest early voting location because make no mistake whatever issue you care about – Ive only mentioned a few tonight but whatever issue you care about is on the ballot, 2567, 2606
Now it may be my name and my opponents name but where we stand on these issues what weve done in the past what we have said we want to do in the future that is all on the ballot, 2606, 2646
The future of our economy is at stake of our education system is at stake, 2646, 2661
Fighting climate change and clean renewable-energy jobs are at stake, 2661, 2671
LGBT equality is at stake, 2671, 2676
Equal pay for women is at stake, 2676, 2683
Actually in the end the American dream itself is at stake, 2683, 2694
So I want you to think about how you will feel on November 9th."  Happy, 2694, 2709
" Happy, 2709, 2711
I think thats the right answer, 2711, 2717
But just suppose just suppose you go to bed early, 2717, 2727
Suppose you go to bed early, 2727, 2733
Maybe you were too busy to vote or maybe you didnt make calls or knock on doors, 2733, 2750
I want you to imagine, 2750, 2755
So you get up early on the morning of the 9th, 2755, 2766
And you log on to the news to find out hey whats going on or maybe you turn on the TV or the radio and you hear."  No! "I want you to really understand what that means for you and for all of us because I prefer for us to be motivated by what were for not what were against, 2766, 2826
But I also think its prudent to imagine what could happen if we dont do our part, 2826, 2843
And when in the future somebody asks you maybe your kids or your grandkids What did you do when everything was on the line? I want you to be able to say I voted for a better fairer stronger America." "Lets go out and in these next eight days do everything we can to make it clear were going after the kind of future that includes everybody, 2843, 2910
Were going to build this economy: new jobs rising wages, 2910, 2920
Were going to make college affordable and help you pay down your student debt, 2920, 2934
We are going to do what will give you the best chance for your own lives and the lives of our kids and our grandkids, 2934, 2959
So if we build that future together we will be able to say we were part of making sure that Americas best days are still ahead of us, 2959, 2987
And we will prove once and for all that love trumps hate." Thank you all." , 2987, 3002
