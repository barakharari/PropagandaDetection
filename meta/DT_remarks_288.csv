Thank you for joining me today, 0, 6
This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism she would be, 6, 32
Even her former Secret Service Agent who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president, 32, 61
There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time and I will deliver that speech soon, 61, 83
But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders, 83, 101
"The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando Florida was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th and the worst mass shooting in our countrys history." So many people dead so many people gravely injured so much carnage such a disgrace, 101, 145
The horror is beyond description, 145, 150
The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, 150, 159
Likewise our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated, 159, 170
We express our deepest sympathies to the victims the wounded and their families, 170, 183
"We mourn as one people for our nations loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it." I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack, 183, 224
SILENCE "Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlandos LGBT Community." "This is a very dark moment in Americas history." A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation, 224, 276
It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation, 276, 292
It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identity, 292, 314
It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country, 314, 335
We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force purpose and determination, 335, 354
But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly, 354, 370
"If we dont get tough and we dont get smart – and fast – were not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left." "The killer whose name I will not use or ever say was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States, 370, 420
His father published support for the Afghan Taliban a regime which murders those who dont share its radical views, 420, 439
The father even said he was running for President of that country." The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here, 439, 477
"That is a fact and its a fact we need to talk about." We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country and it does not permit us to protect our citizens, 477, 519
We have an incompetent administration and if I am not elected President that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change and it must change now, 519, 550
With fifty people dead and dozens more wounded we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on, 550, 575
I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on, 575, 617
The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country, 617, 642
The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States as he deems appropriate, 642, 683
I will use this power to protect the American people, 683, 693
When I am elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States Europe or our allies until we understand how to end these threats, 693, 730
After a full impartial and long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America, 730, 754
We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer, 754, 781
Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions, 781, 795
Radical Islam is anti-woman anti-gay and anti-American, 795, 802
I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people Christian people and Jewish people are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence, 802, 834
"Its not just a national security issue, 834, 841
It is a quality of life issue." If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children gay and straight Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam, 841, 884
We need to tell the truth also about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores, 884, 900
We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president, 900, 925
Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America, 925, 947
All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas, 947, 956
Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS, 956, 968
The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum, 968, 976
"The male shooter in San Bernardino – again whose name I wont mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs." Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year, 976, 1034
According to Pew Research 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law, 1034, 1047
We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views, 1047, 1063
If we want to remain a free and open society then we have to control our borders, 1063, 1080
Yet Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical Islam" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race, 1080, 1114
"However Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is and wont speak honestly about what it is." She is in total denial and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world, 1114, 1173
In fact just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam, 1173, 1195
Here is what she said: "Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism." "Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns, 1195, 1223
They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws in the world and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood, 1223, 1249
Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans abolishing the 2nd amendment and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns, 1249, 1270
She wants to take away Americans guns then admit the very people who want to slaughter us." I will be meeting with the NRA which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror, 1270, 1322
The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America and allow it to grow overseas, 1322, 1346
"In fact Hillary Clintons catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country threatening not only our security but our way of life." "When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism ignorance is not bliss – its deadly." The Obama Administration with the support of Hillary Clinton and others has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement, 1346, 1413
They have put political correctness above common sense above your safety and above all else, 1413, 1428
I refuse to be politically correct, 1428, 1434
I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again, 1434, 1451
The days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon, 1451, 1463
As President I will give our intelligence community law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks, 1463, 1483
We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none, 1483, 1491
That includes better cooperation between state local and federal officials – and with our allies, 1491, 1506
I will have an Attorney General a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done, 1506, 1548
We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat, 1548, 1565
The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th, 1565, 1587
"Nearly a year ago the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obamas Departments of Justice State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States." These Departments refused to comply, 1587, 1621
President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11, 1621, 1643
The public has a right to know how these people got here, 1643, 1655
We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or support radical groups and beliefs, 1655, 1673
We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America, 1673, 1695
Even a single individual can be devastating just look at what happened in Orlando, 1695, 1709
Can you imagine large groups? "Truly our President doesnt know what he is doing, 1709, 1723
He has failed us and failed us badly and under his leadership this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse." Each year the United States permanently admits more than 100000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East, 1723, 1773
Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers year after year without any effective plan for our security, 1773, 1790
"In fact Clintons State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas." Having learned nothing from these attacks she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees, 1790, 1833
This could be a better bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse, 1833, 1845
"We cant let this happen." "Altogether under the Clinton plan youd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them or to prevent the radicalization of their children." The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in, 1845, 1912
The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans, 1912, 1940
The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, 1940, 1956
Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term, 1956, 1967
"Wouldnt this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population including the many poor people already living here?" "We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we dont know who they are they have no documentation and we dont know what theyre planning." What I want is common sense, 1967, 2026
I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values, 2026, 2036
"That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clintons radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests." "Weve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and weve got to do it now because later is too late." Ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community Donald Trump with his actions or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women and murder gays, 2036, 2128
"I dont want them in our country." The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault, 2128, 2155
In San Bernardino as an example people knew what was going on but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it, 2155, 2179
We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives parents friends and associates, 2179, 2194
We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what if any is their immigration status, 2194, 2217
We need to know if he travelled anywhere and who he travelled with, 2217, 2230
"We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didnt tell us – is brought to justice." If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack and did not give this information to authorities they must serve prison time , 2230, 2283
America must do more – much more – to protect its citizens especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations, 2283, 2310
It also means we must change our foreign policy, 2310, 2319
The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria among other things without plans for the day after have created space for ISIS to expand and grow, 2319, 2355
These actions along with our disastrous Iran deal have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region, 2355, 2379
That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism not nation-building, 2379, 2393
"For instance the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clintons war in Libya, 2393, 2406
That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent." "Ive said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism, 2406, 2426
Since Ive raised that criticism NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that." America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism just like we did against communism in the Cold War, 2426, 2465
"Weve tried it President Obamas way, 2465, 2471
He gave the world his apology tour we got ISIS and many other problems in return." "Id like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack." When I am President I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders, 2471, 2527
Wherever they come from wherever they were born all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected, 2527, 2546
America will be a tolerant and open society, 2546, 2554
America will also be a safe society, 2554, 2561
We will protect our borders at home, 2561, 2568
We will defeat ISIS overseas, 2568, 2573
We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety, 2573, 2586
We will make America rich again, 2586, 2592
We will make America safe again, 2592, 2598
We will make American Great Again, 2598, 2604
Thank you, 2604, 2606
The media talks about "homegrown" terrorism but Islamic radicalism and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas, 2606, 2625
"Yes there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past, 2625, 2645
But the whole point is that it will be much much easier to deal with our current problem if we dont keep on bringing in people who add to the problem." For instance the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot, 2645, 2699
This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth, 2699, 2720
Why would we admit people who support violent hatred? "Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women gays and anyone who doesnt share their views." "She cant have it both ways, 2720, 2775
She cant claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them." How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values? "Immigration is a privilege and we should not let anyone into this country who doesnt support our communities – all of our communities." America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny, 2775, 2882
"Not surprisingly wages for our workers havent budged in many years." "So whether its matter of national security or financial security we cant afford to keep on going like this, 2882, 2912
We owe $19 trillion in debt and no longer have options." All our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief, 2912, 2934
This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense, 2934, 2949
I want us all to work together including in partnership with our Muslim communities, 2949, 2963
But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are, 2963, 2989
I want to fix our schools roads bridges and job market, 2989, 3000
I want every American to succeed, 3000, 3006
Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens, 3006, 3030
I want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens, 3030, 3041
