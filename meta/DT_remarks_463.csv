Good morning, 0, 2
Thank you Christine for that kind introduction, 2, 9
I also want to thank the Marcellus Shale Coalition the Ohio Oil and Gas Association and the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association for inviting me to join you here today, 9, 41
Your organizations represent tens of thousands of jobs for hardworking Americans, 41, 52
Let me also recognize my friend Harold Hamm, 52, 60
It is great to be here in Pittsburgh the Steel City, 60, 71
Under a Trump Administration we are going to bring back our steel jobs and we are going to rebuild this nation, 71, 92
Before going any further today I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, 92, 109
Our country desperately needs unity and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not only got us through our toughest times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation, 109, 148
Every day I see people of different backgrounds working together for a common good and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country – and become One American Nation united by our shared values and principles as American Citizens, 148, 191
"We all have to walk a mile in someone elses shoes see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our wounded country." Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding on their TV screens, 191, 229
Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand, 229, 238
"Our country looks bad to the world especially when we are supposed to be the leader, 238, 254
How can we lead when we cant even control our own cities." We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble protest and demonstrate, 254, 281
But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace, 281, 299
Every single American in this country is entitled to live in a safe community, 299, 313
The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to an end, 313, 328
The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities, 328, 350
It is their jobs housing markets schools and economic conditions that will suffer – and the first duty of government is to protect their well-being and safety, 350, 377
There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct, 377, 385
Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration, 385, 403
Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disruptor but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, 403, 433
For every one violent protestor there are thousands of moms and dads and kids in that same community who just want to be able to sleep safely at night, 433, 462
More law enforcement more community engagement more effective policing is what our country needs, 462, 476
Last year we saw a 17% rise in violent crime in our fifty largest cities, 476, 491
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 491, 499
and more than 60% in Baltimore, 499, 505
More than 3000 have been shot in Chicago so far this year alone, 505, 518
Nationwide approximately 60% of murder victims under the age of 22 are African-American, 518, 531
This is a national crisis and it is the job of the next President to work with our governors and mayors to address this crisis and save African-American lives, 531, 560
Look at the example of Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York, 560, 571
The policies he put into place ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent, 571, 589
Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache imaginable, 589, 602
We need a national anti-crime agenda to make our cities safe again, 602, 614
I will appoint the best prosecutors investigators and federal law enforcement officers in the country to dismantle the international cartels gangs and criminal syndicates – and I will stop the drugs from flowing into our country, 614, 650
My Administration will work with local communities and local officials to make the reduction of crime a top priority, 650, 669
Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success: a great education and a good-paying job, 669, 686
To have the best schools and the best jobs you must have safe communities, 686, 700
That means we must recognize the contributions of our police who come from all backgrounds and all walks of life and who often thanklessly risk their own lives to protect the innocent, 700, 732
We all remember earlier this year when officers in Dallas – hunted down for execution – continued protecting the public until their last moments on earth, 732, 758
Every day police officers risk their lives for complete strangers and every year many of them will go out on calls and never return, 758, 782
Police are entrusted with immense responsibility and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed, 782, 817
But our men and women in blue also need our support our thanks and our gratitude, 817, 833
They are the line separating civilization from total chaos, 833, 842
"They are also the front lines of defense in the War on Terror as we saw recently with their quick action following the terrorist attacks in New Jersey and New York and the off-duty police officers heroic actions in Minnesota." In addition to providing safety we must provide economic opportunity, 842, 892
That begins with school choice and leads to a secure job with a rising income, 892, 907
This brings us to the subject of energy, 907, 915
Producing more American energy is a central part of my plan to Making America Wealthy Again – especially for the poorest Americans, 915, 937
America is sitting on a treasure trove of untapped energy – some $50 trillion dollars in shale energy oil reserves and natural gas on federal lands in addition to hundreds of years of coal energy reserves, 937, 973
"Its all upside: more jobs more revenues more wealth higher wages and lower energy prices." I am going to lift the restrictions on American energy and allow this wealth to pour into our communities – including right here in Pennsylvania, 973, 1013
According to the Institute for Energy Research lifting the restrictions on American energy including shale production will accomplish the following: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500000 new jobs annually increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal state and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years, 1013, 1088
In addition we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process, 1088, 1121
Overall my entire economic plan – tax reform regulatory reform energy reform and trade reform – will create at least 25 million new jobs over the next 10 years assuming an average growth rate of 3.5 percent and I believe we will reach 4% growth, 1121, 1166
My tax plan includes a fifteen percent business tax rate for small and large businesses down from 35 percent today – turning America into a jobs magnet, 1166, 1193
Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on some small businesses to as high as 45 percent, 1193, 1208
Income taxes will be simplified from 7 brackets to 3 and middle class Americans will get a major tax cut – including childcare deductions and tax-free childcare savings accounts, 1208, 1237
My plan includes the elimination of all unnecessary regulations and a temporary moratorium on new regulations not compelled by Congress or public safety, 1237, 1260
Overregulation is costing our economy $2 trillion a year, 1260, 1269
On energy my economic plan unlocks our shale oil and gas and the energy technologies of both today and tomorrow, 1269, 1289
"Finally my plan includes a renegotiation of Americas trade deals and the enforcement of trade rules to increase jobs and wealth inside the United States, 1289, 1314
Strong border controls will also protect our workers and save our budget trillions in the long-term." It is perhaps the most pro-growth economic plan in American history, 1314, 1341
Compare that to my opponent, 1341, 1346
She plans a $1.3 trillion tax hike massive new regulations the offshoring of American jobs and the aggressive restriction of American energy production, 1346, 1369
Her plan will help only her wealthy donors and global special interests who benefit from the rigged system, 1369, 1387
Hillary Clinton wants to put the coal miners out of work ban hydraulic fracturing in most places and extensively restrict and ban energy production on public lands and in most offshore areas, 1387, 1419
This will produce devastation for states like Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia where shale energy and coal production are critical parts of the economy, 1419, 1443
Her plan hurts states like Colorado Florida Virginia North Carolina and any anywhere with access to either onshore or offshore energy resources, 1443, 1465
She also supports blocking the energy infrastructure that is needed to move our energy resources to the marketplace, 1465, 1483
According to the Wall Street Journal "Overall more than a dozen fossil fuel projects worth about $33 billion have been either rejected by regulators or withdrawn by developers since 2012 with billions more tied up in projects still in regulatory limbo." Examples of energy transportation projects blocked or abandoned include an $850 million coal export facility in Washington a $3 billion natural gas pipeline in the Northeast and a $6.8 billion Liquid Natural Gas export facility among others, 1483, 1561
Billions of dollars in private infrastructure investment have been lost to the Obama-Clinton restriction agenda, 1561, 1576
The platform produced by Hillary Clintons party this year also calls for a "price on carbon." Thats just political-speak for a massive new tax on coal and shale production – a tax on American consumers, 1576, 1611
"And remember every energy dollar that isnt harvested here in America is harvested instead in a foreign country – often foreign countries not very friendly to us." That not only means we are sending our jobs to those countries but it means energy is being produced in foreign countries that lack our high environmental and conservation standards, 1611, 1668
"That is just one more reason why we should pursue the safe and responsible production of Americas vast energy reserves." We need an America-First energy plan, 1668, 1694
This means opening federal lands for oil and gas production; opening offshore areas; and revoking policies that are imposing unnecessary restrictions on innovative new exploration technologies, 1694, 1720
The development of the Marcellus and Utica Shales will fundamentally change the economic landscape of this region and our country bringing extraordinary new prosperity to millions – more jobs higher wages a larger tax base and dollars flowing into our country for a change instead of out of our country, 1720, 1770
"Hillary Clintons war on energy will cost our economy $5 trillion dollars." She has not only declared war on the miners but on oil and natural gas production – which supports 10 million jobs in the United States, 1770, 1808
Access to low-cost liquid natural gas also supports the American chemical industry which supports 40000 jobs in Pennsylvania, 1808, 1826
We have just begun as a nation to recognize our economic advantage that is made possible by shale energy, 1826, 1845
The Shale Energy Revolution will unleash massive wealth for American workers and families, 1845, 1858
At the same time this energy revolution will produce new demand for American steel, 1858, 1872
But federal restrictions remain a major impediment to both shale production specifically and energy production in general, 1872, 1889
Currently less than 10 percent of the federally managed surface and mineral estates are leased for oil and gas development, 1889, 1909
"Almost 90% of our nations offshore acreage is off-limits to energy production." Our energy policy will make full use of our domestic energy sources including traditional and renewable energy sources, 1909, 1939
That means we will end the war on coal, 1939, 1948
I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium the excessive Interior Department stream rule and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration, 1948, 1976
We will eliminate the highly-invasive "Waters of the US" rule and scrap the $5 trillion dollar Obama-Clinton Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan – these unilateral plans will increase monthly electric bills by double-digits without any measurable improvement in climate, 1976, 2018
I will refocus the EPA on its core mission of ensuring clean air and clean safe drinking water for all Americans, 2018, 2039
I believe firmly in conserving our wonderful natural resources and beautiful natural habitats, 2039, 2052
My environmental agenda will be guided by true specialists in conservation not those with radical political agendas, 2052, 2069
It will be a future of conservation of prosperity and of great success, 2069, 2082
It will be a future of new technology new innovation and new solutions, 2082, 2095
It will be a future we can achieve together beginning with a victory on November 8th, 2095, 2111
We Will make America Wealthy Again, 2111, 2117
We Will make America Safe Again, 2117, 2123
And We Will Make America Great Again, 2123, 2130
