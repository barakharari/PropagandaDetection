"I am scared of what a Republican president will mean for my family." Dear Hillary "My name is Kevin and Im a 26-year-old man living in the suburbs of Atlanta, 0, 30
I work for a non-profit I pay a mortgage and I work hard to make ends meet, 30, 47
These are just some of the identities I hold." "Im also a gay man, 47, 61
I have a husband Robbin who is a middle school teacher, 61, 72
We got married in 2014 in New York, 72, 80
When we got back home to Atlanta we were married in our hearts but unfortunately not in our home state, 80, 100
In 2015 we had to file our state taxes as single unmarried individuals, 100, 113
We were obviously thrilled with the Supreme Court Obergefell decision in June 2015 because it meant we were officially married at home and everywhere else in the country, 113, 141
However it was discouraging to see elected leaders all over the country some even in our own state vow to work to reverse the outcomes of the decision." "Two months ago (in December 2015) we adopted a baby boy who we named Grey, 141, 184
He is 7 weeks old now, 184, 190
Were so thrilled and excited to be parents; our hearts are so full of love for this child, 190, 208
We felt so relieved that the Obergefell decision paved the way to allow us to adopt as a couple, 208, 227
Previously we would have had to adopt Grey as single parents and go through the process of adoption twice." I want you to know that I support you because you have supported me in some of the most delicate and pivotal moments in my life, 227, 272
I remember that day in December of 2011 watching you with tears in my eyes as you said "Gay rights are human rights and human rights are gay rights." I remember vividly that day in 2013 just six months before Robbin and I got engaged when you released a video in which you said "LGBT Americans are our colleagues our teachers our soldiers our friends our loved ones and they are full and equal citizens" and that they deserve all rightsâ€”including marriage, 272, 354
And in October of 2015 the month that Robbin and I would be matched with our soon-to-be born son you said to the world that "Being a good parent has nothing to do with your sexual orientation or your gender identity." "Robbin and I are trying to live the American dream in which we work hard and provide a life that allows our child to succeed and have it better than we did, 354, 427
I know that you understand the depth of love one can feel for their child and I know that you will appreciate my urgency in feeling like that dream is in danger, 427, 459
Of course I am a supporter of your campaign for more than just your social policies, 459, 475
However my family and I have a personal stake in this election that goes beyond just political beliefs and lies at the very core of our identity, 475, 502
I support you because you are the only person running who I trust to keep our family from danger, 502, 521
You are the only person running who has declared that our family is real valid and deserving, 521, 538
A Republican alternative to you will not look at our family and see all of that, 538, 554
Im frankly scared of Grey turning on the TV and seeing a Republican president who is outspoken about his belief that gay couples shouldnt be allowed to marry or that gay parents are not adequate to provide all the opportunities that a heterosexual couple can provide, 554, 600
I am scared of what a Republican president will mean for my family." "For someone that Ive never met youre one of the few people whom I feel has truly supported me, 600, 632
My family and I will do all that we can to get you to the White House in 2016, 632, 651
Attached is a photo of our family and a picture of Grey, 651, 663
Just like us he has his own Hillary apparel and wants you to know that hes your biggest littlest fan." Sincerely Kevin Robbin and Grey , 663, 688
