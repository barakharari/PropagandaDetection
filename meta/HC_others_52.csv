"Over the past four debates the subject of ISIS and Iran have come up a number of times, 0, 18
These are complex and challenging times and we need a Commander in Chief who knows how to protect America and our allies and advance our interests and values around the world, 18, 49
The stakes are high, 49, 53
And we are concerned that Senator Sanders has not thought through these crucial national security issues that can have profound consequences for our security, 53, 77
"His lack of a strategy for defeating ISIS - one of the greatest challenges we face today - is troubling, 77, 97
And the limited things he has said on ISIS are also troubling, 97, 109
"For example his call for more Iranian troops in Syria is dangerous and misguided and the opposite of what is needed, 109, 130
Supporting xa0Iranian soldiers on Israels doorstep is a grave mistake, 130, 140
And while we support de-escalation of Sunni-Shia tensions his argument that Iran and Saudi Arabia - two intense adversaries - should join together in a military coalition is just puzzling, 140, 170
Indeed the Iranian government recently failed to stop protesters from ransacking and burning the Saudi embassy in Tehran after which Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic ties with Iran, 170, 198
"We are all strong supporters of the nuclear diplomacy with Iran, 198, 209
Some of us were part of developing the policy that produced the diplomacy over the past several years, 209, 227
And we believe that there are areas for further cooperation under the right circumstances, 227, 241
But Senator Sanders call to "move aggressively" to normalize relations with Iran - to develop a "warm" relationship - breaks with President Obama is out of step with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that has been working for the United States and if pursued would fail while causing consternation among our allies and partners, 241, 296
"Given these concerns it is important to ask what he would do on other issues - on Russia China our allies nuclear proliferation and so much else, 296, 323
We look forward to hearing him address these issues, 323, 332
"We need a Commander in Chief who sees how all of these dynamics fit together - someone who sees the whole chessboard as Hillary Clinton does." Jeremy B, 332, 360
