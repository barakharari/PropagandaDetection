" n "Including premiums like in the great state of Arizona where theyre going to go up at 116 percent, 289, 309
Dont worry youll be there very soon unless I win in which case youre not going to have to worry about it, 309, 331
" n Even Bill Clinton admitted that Obamacare is quote "The craziest thing in the world where people wind up paying their premiums which double and their coverage is cut in half."n Job killing  n Job killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged, 331, 378
Remember the name Jonathan Gruber the architect of Obamacare?  n "He said they could pass Obamacare when he didnt know he was being recorded he said they could pass Obamacare because the stupidity of the American voter will allow it to take place, 378, 421
" n The only stupidity was that incredible stupidity shown by our politicians when they forced this bill through over the furious objection to many politicians in all fairness many many politicians but really the American people, 421, 458
And it was very very sad, 458, 464
And in all fairness to the Democrats had our President not lied 28 times remember you can keep your plan you can keep your doctor it passed by this much they would not have gone for it, 464, 501

You dont even get to use Obamacare because the deductible is so high and you know its just Look it is so it is so out of control youll never get to use it, 570, 604
Four or five thousand dollars before you can start taking Just this and just happened Hillary Clinton declared that Obamacare do you remember this not so long ago as one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama of the Democratic Party and of our county, 604, 649
Its a total disaster, 649, 653

Good luck good luck in negotiations folks, 667, 674
That means that all the residents covered by plans from these companies will be getting cancellation notices very soon, 674, 693
Obamacare is really and you know this a catastrophe its a catastrophic event for Ohio workers and is making it impossible for many parents to pay their bills support their families or get quality medical care to their children, 693, 732
Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November eighth, 732, 748
" n Have to win, 748, 753
Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington D.C, 753, 765
 n "Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33000 e-mails lied to Congress under oath made 13 phone calls I mean 13 13 phones made them disappear sometimes with a hammer, 765, 794

through the Foundation donations paid speeches and consulting contracts, 905, 914
Mr, 914, 915
Band called the arrangement unorthodox, 915, 920
The rest of us call it outright corrupt, 920, 928
In fact the Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay to play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS.n "If the Clintons were willing to play this fast and loose with their enterprise when they werent in the White House just imagine what theyll do given the change to once again control the Oval Office, 928, 991
And weve had enough, 991, 995
Honestly I think weve had enough of the Clintons in all fairness, 995, 1007
Right? Dont you agree? " n Had enough, 1007, 1015

and we are going to drain the swamp, 1166, 1174
" n "A lot of spirit in this room its a good one, 1174, 1187
That includes a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress, 1187, 1201
At the core of my contract is my economic plan, 1201, 1211
That plan can be summarized in three very beautiful words especially for the people in this area and this room jobs jobs jobs.n" "No its terrible whats happened whats happened in this area whats happened in this country with jobs is terrible, 1211, 1253
Hillary Clinton promised to bring upstate New York 200000 jobs when she ran for Senate, 1253, 1268
Instead the jobs left, 1268, 1272
They didnt come in they left, 1272, 1278

Our airports our roads our bridges our tunnels our schools our hospitals, 1379, 1391
Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year, 1391, 1404
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 1404, 1418
Think of it, 1418, 1421
And thats so true, 1421, 1425
The single greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.n" What our politicians have allowed to happen to this area but to all areas of our country, 1425, 1453
NAFTA TPP they want to approve, 1453, 1459
A disaster, 1459, 1461
Ohio has lost one in four manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary Clinton, 1461, 1483
Remember every time you see a closed factory a wiped out community in Ohio it was essentially caused by the Clintons, 1483, 1504
It was NAFTA, 1504, 1507
It was caused by the Clintons, 1507, 1513
Why a deal like that was allowed.n "Weve lost 70000 factories, 1513, 1524
Think of that one 70, 1524, 1529
I tell everybody its a typo, 1529, 1535
Cant be 70000, 1535, 1538
It is, 1538, 1540
Weve lost 70000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster, 1540, 1556
Just this year Eaton Corporation in Ohio closed its plant laid off 152 workers and moved their jobs to Mexico, 1556, 1576
And youve had many, 1576, 1580
I could I could name them all day long.n" Under my contract if a company wants to fire their workers move to Mexico or other countries and ship their products back into the United States we will put a 35 percent tariff on those products, 1580, 1625
 n "And folks just in case you have any questions when that happens youre not losing your companies anymore, 1625, 1644
And if you do at least the countrys gonna make a lot of money, 1644, 1658
OK? We will immediately begin renegotiating NAFTA and if we dont get the deal we want - right now its a one-way highway, 1658, 1681
We lose our jobs we lose our companies we lose everything, 1681, 1692
We lose our cash, 1692, 1696
They get the cash they get the jobs they get the companies, 1696, 1708
We get the drugs we get the unemployment, 1708, 1716
Thats what we get, 1716, 1720
We get nothing, 1720, 1723
We get less than nothing.n" "We will terminate NAFTA and get a much better deal for our workers if we cant renegotiate it properly, 1723, 1747
Were gonna get a better deal for our workers and for our companies, 1747, 1760

We cant, 1772, 1774
We cant, 1774, 1776
" n As part of our plan to bring back American jobs we will lower taxes on our businesses from 35 percent down to 15 percent, 1776, 1802
We will also cut taxes for middle class families by 35 percent and massively simplify taxes for all Americans, 1802, 1821

Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world you know that story, 1843, 1854
And spreading violently its spreading now into the United States, 1854, 1864
There are now 1000 open ISIS investigations in the United States, 1864, 1875
ISIS is on a campaign of genocide against Christians in the Middle East or what they call the Nation of the Cross, 1875, 1897
OK, 1897, 1898
The Nation of the Cross.n" They are crucifying drowning and beheading their victims, 1898, 1911
This is something that we would read about in history books, 1911, 1922
And not since medieval times right? Have you heard the beheadings and all the things that are happening, 1922, 1940
So we have no choice, 1940, 1945
We will stop ISIS and we still stop them fast, 1945, 1955
 n And unlike what theyve done in Mosul which is turning out to be very difficult were not giving three and four months notice, 1955, 1979
Were coming in, 1979, 1982
Were coming in, 1982, 1985
You think General George Patton would say "Were coming in in three or four months get ready"? What a bunch, 1985, 2005
Theyre throwing people off buildings hanging their victims from meat hooks, 2005, 2016
Theyre hanging their victims from meat hooks, 2016, 2023
The New York Post just published reports about ISIS crushing children to death and burning adults alive.n Now Hillary wants massive immigration from the most dangerous regions of the world where ISIS operates including a 550 percent increase in Syrian refugees over and above the thousands and thousands that President Obama is taking, 2023, 2076
 n "We dont want ISIS in our country, 2076, 2084
The Hillary refugee plan would leave us with generations of terrorism radicalism and extremism inside of our shores, 2084, 2102
I only want to admit people who will support this country and love its people, 2102, 2117
SO important, 2117, 2119
" n Keeping our families safe is the highest obligation of the president of the United States, 2119, 2136
A Trump administration is going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions, 2136, 2147
And we will suspend the Syrian refugee program, 2147, 2155
That was easy, 2155, 2158
 n "Were not going to take the risk when it comes to the safety of the American people, 2158, 2176
No longer, 2176, 2178
So let me state this as clearly as I can, 2178, 2188
If Im elected president I am going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country, 2188, 2206
" n Hillary also said she wants totally open borders, 2206, 2216
 n No one who supports open borders can ever serve as president of the United States, 2216, 2232
Totally open borders, 2232, 2235
A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States, 2235, 2249

Mexico in terms of our trade deficits is making a fortune off the United States, 2285, 2300
Their leaders are doing a much smarter job, 2300, 2308
But you know what? Well be happy with Mexico, 2308, 2317
Mexicos gonna be wonderful were going to have a great relationship with Mexico with China and with other - we dont even have good relationships now, 2317, 2343
They rip us off and we still dont get along, 2343, 2353

Earlier that day her killer shot another woman in the arm while she was with her children in a nearby park, 2394, 2415
Police encountered the man more than three weeks before the crime scene but federal authorities refused to take him into custody even though people were saying "Please please dont let him out, 2415, 2447
Please take him in."n "Then there is the case of 90-year old Earl Olander a Minnesota farmer who was brutally beaten by illegal immigrants and left to bleed to death in his home, 2447, 2480
