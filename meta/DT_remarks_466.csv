"Thank you, 0, 2
Its wonderful to be here in Virginia a state where I have so many great friends and wonderful employees." Tremendous polls keep coming in, 2, 26
A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide, 26, 37
On November 8th we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House, 37, 56
"We are going to take on the big donors and big business and big media – we are going to take on the rigged system that has shipped Americas wealth to other countries." We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you your family and your country, 56, 111
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 111, 126
We will cut taxes for all working and middle-class households in America, 126, 138
We will reduce regulations which will put more money into the hands of our poorest workers and bring thousands of new companies to our shores, 138, 163
We will unleash American energy creating millions of new jobs and lowering energy costs, 163, 177
The Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are nothing more than a massive tax on the poor – we will remove those restrictions day one, 177, 199
We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, 199, 206
President Obama promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2500 dollars, 206, 217
Instead they surged $5000, 217, 221
Our replacement plan includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts with support for those who need it, 221, 238
It includes allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines in all 50 states creating a dynamic and competitive new market – they will be competing for your business, 238, 268
"Were also going to block grant Medicaid so states can develop innovative solutions to make sure no citizen in poverty ever falls through the cracks, 268, 293
High-risk pools will also help to ensure that those with pre-existing conditions will always get the quality coverage they need." On trade we are going to end the international abuse the foreign cheating and the one-sided rules that govern NAFTA and the World Trade Organization, 293, 338
Right now America eliminates its tariffs but then other countries tax our goods with backdoor tariffs and close their markets, 338, 358
"Our massive chronic trade deficits are destroying the middle class – and shifting money away from workers to large corporations who have no borders, 358, 382
Theres a reason hedge funds and Wall Street are giving tens of millions to my opponent." Hillary Clinton is the voice for the global special interests, 382, 408
I am running to be the voice of the forgotten men and women, 408, 421
My opponent likes to say that for decades she has been "fighting for women." That she has been "fighting for children." Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying "Watch what I do not what I say." At the Trump Organization and in my campaign for President women occupy some of the highest positions, 421, 508
I have employed thousands of women in my company, 508, 517
Women of different backgrounds, 517, 521
Women of many talents, 521, 525
And just last week joined by my daughter Ivanka I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare, 525, 543
That plan has many great features including tax-free childcare savings accounts, 543, 554
Low-income parents are given tax credits they can put straight into those accounts and then get a $500 dollar per child match for those savings accounts deposits, 554, 581
Families can also deduct the cost of childcare from their taxes a huge tax cut for the middle class, 581, 600
We have also talked about improving education, 600, 607
My plan includes school choice for every disadvantaged child in America, 607, 618
We are also going to bring down the cost of college, 618, 629
"Universities get massive federal funds and huge tax breaks for their endowments – but then they dont spend those funds or those endowments on their students, 629, 655
I will work with Congress to make sure these special federal benefits are not available unless universities begin to reduce tuition and student debt, 655, 679
This will get to the problem at the source and reduce both the cost for students and the cost for taxpayers, 679, 700
Our students are drowning and were going to fix it." Women also value security, 700, 714
They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism stop the massive inflow of refugees protect our borders and who will reduce the rising crime and violence in our cities, 714, 745
As I campaign across this country I hear so many stories and pleas from women especially about drug addiction and opioid use, 745, 767
They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment, 767, 786
But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth and increasingly many adults from the scourge of drugs, 786, 805
We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use, 805, 817
I will stop the drug inflow from our borders, 817, 826
These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities and into our suburbs, 826, 846
This must change, 846, 849
Every change starts with a conversation, 849, 855
Together we will have this conversation, 855, 861
And we will make this change, 861, 867
The changes will start immediately, 867, 872
Here in Virginia we are going to end the war on American energy, 872, 885
Hillary Clinton says she wants to put the miners out of work, 885, 897
Clinton and Kaine also want to shut down shale and shut down natural gas, 897, 911
The Clinton regulatory agenda will drive up electricity prices for Virginia families and will cost the U.S, 911, 928
economy over $5 trillion, 928, 932
By the way less than a week after taking office Tim Kaine proposed a $4 billion dollar tax hike in Virginia including on people earning as little as $17000 dollars a year, 932, 964
We are going to open up all sources of American energy and bring jobs wealth and cheaper electricity to Virginia, 964, 984
Another major part of our agenda is safety, 984, 992
I believe every family in America is entitled to live in safety and peace, 992, 1006
Today the nation just opened the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture, 1006, 1020
We congratulate and honor those involved with the project and recognize today the incredible contributions of the African-American community to this nation, 1020, 1042
African-Americans have given so much to this nation and sacrificed so much for this nation, 1042, 1057
Many African-Americans are succeeding so greatly in our country and I will make sure their success is protected and supported, 1057, 1077
At the same time too many African-Americans have been left behind and trapped in poverty, 1077, 1092
I will fight to make sure every single African-American child in this country is fully included in the American Dream, 1092, 1112
That includes the new civil rights issue of our time: School Choice, 1112, 1124
Democrats have run the inner cities for half a century or more and produced only more joblessness and poverty, 1124, 1143
The jobs are leaving the schools are failing and crime is rising, 1143, 1155
To those suffering I say: Vote for Donald Trump, 1155, 1164
What do you have to lose? I will fix it, 1164, 1174
I will fight harder for you than anyone has before, 1174, 1184
The policies of Hillary Clinton have brought only suffering in our inner cities – just like her bad judgment overseas unleashed suffering everywhere she went, 1184, 1209
Of course she got rich through it all – the Clintons made another $60 million in gross income while she was Secretary of State, 1209, 1233
Worst of all she put her public office up for sale – and then bleached her emails and destroyed her phones to try to cover her tracks following a congressional subpoena, 1233, 1264
"Theres a reason the hedge fund managers are donating to Hillary Clintons campaign – and not mine, 1264, 1281
Everybody getting rich off the rigged system and who wants nothing to change are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton." My campaign is powered by my own money and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens, 1281, 1318
95% of our donors are small dollar donations, 1318, 1326
Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you, 1326, 1336
"Our campaign is about breaking up the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C, 1336, 1349
Were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives, 1349, 1366
Theyre all part of the same political establishment." They go to the same restaurants they attend the same conferences they have the same friends and connections, 1366, 1392
They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs your factories and your wealth to other countries, 1392, 1416
I am not running to be President of the World, 1416, 1426
I am running to be President of the United States, 1426, 1436
I Am For America – and America First, 1436, 1444
Together we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams, 1444, 1454
Government will start working again, 1454, 1459
Fixing things is what I do, 1459, 1465
Just look at my projects in New York where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business activity and opportunity – where others saw only problems I saw only potential, 1465, 1496
We turned empty lots into homes offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families, 1496, 1512
"Thats what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods the failing schools the forgotten stretches of this nation and unlock their potential for all of our people." "Ive made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be, 1512, 1564
Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses – I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions." "We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be weve stopped thinking about how great things could be – all we have to do is tune out the doubters the cynics and the naysayers." "We are a nation of strivers dreamers and believers – and thats the spirit that will carry us to victory in November and to great victories as a nation." "Its that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint Michigan." "It used to be the cars were made in Flint and you couldnt drink the water in Mexico, 1564, 1697
Today cars are made in Mexico and you cant drink the water in Flint, 1697, 1711
Well turn it all around." But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th, 1711, 1729
You have to knock on doors, 1729, 1735
You have to pick up that phone, 1735, 1742
Go to our website to learn more, 1742, 1749
You have to campaign on the streets, 1749, 1756
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country, 1756, 1771
To beat the system you have to lift your voice pound the pavement and get out the vote, 1771, 1789
You have 44 days until the big vote, 1789, 1797
You have 44 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country, 1797, 1813
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation, 1813, 1831
The arrogance of Washington D.C, 1831, 1836
will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 1836, 1850
This November 8th we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before, 1850, 1874
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration – and yes we will build the wall Mexico will pay; save the 2nd amendment and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1874, 1937
We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1937, 1949
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1949, 1969
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1969, 1978
And we will put our great miners and steelworkers back to work, 1978, 1990
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation, 1990, 2008
American workers will be hired to do the job, 2008, 2017
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 2017, 2029
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People, 2029, 2053
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 2053, 2074
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 2074, 2096
Hillary Clinton has a 3-word campaign pledge, 2096, 2103
It reads: "Im With Her." "I have a different pledge: Im With You – the American People." "To all of our people in all of our cities and towns I say these words to you tonight: Im with you I will fight for you and I will win for you." Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 2103, 2166
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 2166, 2172
We Will Make America Strong Again, 2172, 2178
We Will Make America Safe Again, 2178, 2184
And We Will Make America Great Again, 2184, 2191
Thank you and God Bless! , 2191, 2196
