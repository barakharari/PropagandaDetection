"Thank you thank you so much, 0, 6
Thank you all very much, 6, 11
Thank you, 11, 13
Thank you San Diego for that warm warm welcome and thanks to Ellen for those moving words her introduction and for reminding us its not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country its their families their spouses their children and we are grateful to each and every one of them, 13, 67
I want to recognize and thank Congressman Scott Peters for being here thank you very much." And all of the other electeds and service members active duty and retired National Guard and Reservists veterans military spouses family members all who are with us today, 67, 111
On Monday we observed Memorial Day – a day that means a great deal to San Diego home of so many active-duty and former military and their families, 111, 139
We honor the sacrifice of those who died for our country in many ways – by living our values by making this a stronger and fairer nation and by carrying out a smart and principled foreign policy, 139, 176
"Thats what I want to speak about today – the challenges we face in protecting our country and the choice at stake in this election." "Its a choice between a fearful America thats less secure and less engaged with the world and a strong confident America that leads to keep our country safe and our economy growing." "As Secretary of State Senator and First Lady I had the honor of representing America abroad and helping shape our foreign policy at home, 176, 257
As a candidate for President theres nothing I take more seriously than our national security, 257, 272
Ive offered clear strategies for how to defeat ISIS strengthen our alliances and make sure Iran never gets a nuclear weapon, 272, 293
And Im going to keep Americas security at the heart of my campaign." "Because as you know so well Americans arent just electing a President in November, 293, 320
Were choosing our next commander-in-chief – the person we count on to decide questions of war and peace life and death." And like many across our country and around the world I believe the person the Republicans have nominated for President cannot do the job, 320, 365
"Donald Trumps ideas arent just different – they are dangerously incoherent, 365, 376
Theyre not even really ideas – just a series of bizarre rants personal feuds and outright lies." He is not just unprepared – he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge stability and immense responsibility, 376, 414
"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes – because its not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin." "We cannot put the security of our children and grandchildren in Donald Trumps hands, 414, 462
We cannot let him roll the dice with America." This is a man who said that more countries should have nuclear weapons including Saudi Arabia, 462, 487
This is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO – the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home, 487, 517
He believes we can treat the U.S, 517, 524
economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008, 524, 555
He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists – even though those are war crimes, 555, 586
"He says he doesnt have to listen to our generals or our admirals our ambassadors and other high officials because he has – quote –xa0a very good brain." "He also said I know more about ISIS than the generals do believe me.xa0You know what? I dont believe him." "He says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese and he has the gall to say that prisoners of war like John McCain arent heroes." He praises dictators like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our friends – including the British prime minister the mayor of London the German chancellor the president of Mexico and the Pope, 586, 693
He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia, 693, 709
"And to top it off he believes America is weak, 709, 719
An embarrassment, 719, 721
He called our military a disaster, 721, 727
He said we are – and I quote – axa0third-world country.xa0And hes been saying things like that for decades." "Those are the words my friends of someone who doesnt understand America or the world." "And theyre the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction, 727, 775
Because if you really believe America is weak – with our military our values our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching – then you dont know America." "And you certainly dont deserve to lead it." "Thats why – even if I werent in this race – Id be doing everything I could to make sure Donald Trump never becomes President – because I believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path." Unlike him I have some experience with the tough calls and the hard work of statecraft, 775, 868
I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran and stood up for the rights of women religious minorities and LGBT people around the world, 868, 922
And I have I have sat in the Situation Room and advised the President on some of the toughest choices he faced, 922, 944
"So Im not new to this work, 944, 951
And Im proud to run on my record because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear." "I believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made America great, 951, 997
And I believe with all my heart that America is an exceptional country – that were still in Lincolns words the last best hope of earth, 997, 1023
We are not a country that cowers behind walls, 1023, 1032
We lead with purpose and we prevail." "And if America doesnt lead we leave a vacuum – and that will either cause chaos or other countries will rush in to fill the void, 1032, 1065
Then theyll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety – and trust me the choices they make will not be to our benefit." That is not an outcome we can live with, 1065, 1103
As I see it there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead, 1103, 1133
These are all areas in which Donald Trump and I profoundly disagree, 1133, 1145
And they are all critical to our future, 1145, 1153
First we need to be strong at home, 1153, 1161
"That means investing in our infrastructure education and innovation – the fundamentals of a strong economy, 1161, 1177
We need to reduce income inequality because our country cant lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families, 1177, 1201
And we need to break down the barriers that hold Americans back including barriers of bigotry and discrimination." "Compare that with what Trump wants to do, 1201, 1227
His economic plans would add more than $30 trillion – thats trillion with axa0Txa0– $30 trillion to our national debt over the next 20 years, 1227, 1252
He has no ideas on education, 1252, 1258
No ideas on innovation, 1258, 1262
He has a lot of ideas about who to blame but no clue about what to do." None of what Donald Trump is offering will make America stronger at home, 1262, 1292
And that would make us weaker in the world, 1292, 1301
Second we need to stick with our allies, 1301, 1309
"Americas network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional, 1309, 1320
And our allies deliver for us every day." Our armed forces fight terrorists together; our diplomats work side by side, 1320, 1340
Allies provide staging areas for our military so we can respond quickly to events on the other side of the world, 1340, 1361
And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats, 1361, 1373
Take the threat posed by North Korea – perhaps the most repressive regime on the planet run by a sadistic dictator who wants to develop long-range missiles that could carry a nuclear weapon to the United States, 1373, 1410
When I was Secretary of State we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us, 1410, 1460
The technology is ours, 1460, 1464
Key parts of it are located on Japanese ships, 1464, 1473
All three countries contributed to it, 1473, 1479
And this month all three of our militaries will run a joint drill to test it, 1479, 1495
"Thats the power of allies." "And its the legacy of American troops who fought and died to secure those bonds because they knew we were safer with friends and partners." "Now Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world because they have nothing to match them, 1495, 1545
Theyd love for us to elect a President who would jeopardize that source of strength, 1545, 1560
If Donald gets his way theyll be celebrating in the Kremlin, 1560, 1571
We cannot let that happen." "Thats why it is no small thing when he talks about leaving NATO or says hell stay neutral on Israels security." "Its no small thing when he calls Mexican immigrants rapists and murderers, 1571, 1609
Were lucky to have two friendly neighbors on our land borders, 1609, 1620
Why would he want to make one of them an enemy?" "And its no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan encourage them to get nuclear weapons and said this about a war between Japan and North Korea – and I quote –xa0If they do they do, 1620, 1674
Good luck enjoy yourself folks.xa0I wonder if he even realizes hes talking about nuclear war." Yes our friends need to contribute their fair share, 1674, 1698
I made that point long before Donald Trump came onto the scene – and a number of them have increased their defense spending, 1698, 1721
The real debate here is whether we keep these alliances strong or cut them off, 1721, 1736
What he says would weaken our country, 1736, 1743
Third we need to embrace all the tools of American power especially diplomacy and development to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home, 1743, 1771
"Diplomacy is often the only way to avoid a conflict that could end up exacting a much greater cost, 1771, 1790
It takes patience persistence and an eye on the long game – but its worth it." Take the nuclear agreement with Iran, 1790, 1812
When President Obama took office Iran was racing toward a nuclear bomb, 1812, 1824
Some called for military action, 1824, 1829
But that could have ignited a broader war that could have mired our troops in another Middle Eastern conflict, 1829, 1848
President Obama chose a different path, 1848, 1854
And I got to work leading the effort to impose crippling global sanctions, 1854, 1867
We brought Iran to the table, 1867, 1873
We began talks, 1873, 1876
And eventually we reached an agreement that should block every path for Iran to get a nuclear weapon, 1876, 1894
"Now we must enforce that deal vigorously, 1894, 1901
And as Ive said many times before our approach must bexa0distrust and verify.xa0The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary including with military action to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, 1901, 1938
In particular Israels security is non-negotiable, 1938, 1944
Theyre our closest ally in the region and we have a moral obligation to defend them." "But there is no question that the world and the United States we are safer now than we were before this agreement, 1944, 1982
And we accomplished it without firing a single shot dropping a single bomb or putting a single American soldier in harms way." "Donald Trump says we shouldnt have done the deal, 1982, 2013
We should have walked away, 2013, 2018
But that would have meant no more global sanctions and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us, 2018, 2038
So then what? War? Telling the world good luck you deal with Iran?" "Of course Trump doesnt have answers to those questions, 2038, 2060
Donald Trump doesnt know the first thing about Iran or its nuclear program, 2060, 2073
Ask him, 2073, 2075
Itll become very clear very quickly." "Theres no risk of people losing their lives if you blow up a golf-course deal." But it doesnt work like that in world affairs, 2075, 2105
Just like being interviewed on the same episode of "60 Minutes" as Putin was is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin, 2105, 2129
"So the stakes in global statecraft are infinitely higher and more complex than in the world of luxury hotels, 2129, 2148
We all know the tools Donald Trump brings to the table – bragging mocking composing nasty tweets – Im willing to bet hes writing a few right now." "But those tools wont do the trick, 2148, 2183
Rather than solving global crises he would create new ones." "He has no sense of what it takes to deal with multiple countries with competing interests and reaching a solution that everyone can get behind, 2183, 2218
In fact he is downright contemptuous of that work, 2218, 2227
And that means hes much more likely to end up leading us into conflict." Fourth we need to be firm but wise with our rivals, 2227, 2252
"Countries like Russia and China often work against us, 2252, 2261
Beijing dumps cheap steel in our markets, 2261, 2268
That hurts American workers, 2268, 2272
Moscow has taken aggressive military action in Ukraine right on NATOs doorstep, 2272, 2284
Now Ive gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China and many other different leaders around the world, 2284, 2300
So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must and find common ground when we can." "Thats how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles and with China to increase pressure on North Korea, 2300, 2349
Its how our diplomats negotiated the landmark agreement on climate change which Trump now wants to rip up." The key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements, 2349, 2394
"Donald doesnt see the complexity, 2394, 2399
He wants to start a trade war with China, 2399, 2408
And I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements – I do too, 2408, 2425
But a trade war is something very different, 2425, 2433
We went down that road in the 1930s, 2433, 2441
It made the Great Depression longer and more painful, 2441, 2450
Combine that with his comments about defaulting on our debt and its not hard to see how a Trump presidency could lead to a global economic crisis." "And I have to say I dont understand Donalds bizarre fascination with dictators and strongmen who have no love for America, 2450, 2498
He praised China for the Tiananmen Square massacre; he said it showed strength, 2498, 2511
He saidxa0Youve got to give Kim Jong Un creditxa0for taking over North Korea – something he did by murdering everyone he saw as a threat including his own uncle which Donald described gleefully like he was recapping an action movie, 2511, 2551
And he said if he were grading Vladimir Putin as a leader hed give him an A." "Now Ill leave it to the psychiatrists to explain his affection for tyrants." "I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who Americas real friends are, 2551, 2596
Because it matters, 2596, 2599
If you dont know exactly who youre dealing with men like Putin will eat your lunch." Fifth we need a real plan for confronting terrorists, 2599, 2624
"As we saw six months ago in San Bernardino the threat is real and urgent, 2624, 2639
Over the past year Ive laid out my plans for defeating ISIS." "We need to take out their strongholds in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the air campaign and stepping up our support for Arab and Kurdish forces on the ground, 2639, 2680
We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syrias civil war and close Iraqs sectarian divide because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive, 2680, 2703
We need to lash up with our allies and ensure our intelligence services are working hand-in-hand to dismantle the global network that supplies money arms propaganda and fighters to the terrorists, 2703, 2734
We need to win the battle in cyberspace." And of course we need to strengthen our defenses here at home, 2734, 2754
That – in a nutshell – is my plan for defeating ISIS, 2754, 2766
"Whats Trumps? Well he wont say, 2766, 2772
He is literally keeping it a secret, 2772, 2779
The secret of course is he has no idea what hed do to stop ISIS." "Just look at the few things hes actually said on the subject." "Hes actually said – and I quote –maybe Syria should be a free zone for ISIS.xa0Oh okay – let a terrorist group have control of a major country in the Middle East." Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS, 2779, 2858
He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS which would mean mass civilian casualties, 2858, 2875
"Its clear he doesnt have a clue what hes talking about, 2875, 2886
So we cant be certain which of these things he would do, 2886, 2898
But we can be certain that hes capable of doing any or all of them, 2898, 2913
Letting ISIS run wild, 2913, 2917
Launching a nuclear attack, 2917, 2921
Starting a ground war, 2921, 2925
These are all distinct possibilities with Donald Trump in charge." "And through all his loose talk theres one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS, 2925, 2955
His proposal to ban 1.5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesnt just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on, 2955, 2979
Its also a huge propaganda victory for ISIS, 2979, 2987
And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight." A Trump Presidency would embolden ISIS, 2987, 3008
We cannot take that risk, 3008, 3013
"This isnt reality television – this is actual reality." And defeating global terrorist networks and protecting the homeland takes more than empty talk and a handful of slogans, 3013, 3041
It takes a real plan real experience and real leadership, 3041, 3051
Donald Trump lacks all three, 3051, 3056
And one more thing, 3056, 3060
A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy, 3060, 3085
Our troops give their all, 3085, 3090
They deserve a commander-in-chief who knows that, 3090, 3097
"Ive worked side-by-side with admirals and generals and visited our troops in theaters of war, 3097, 3112
Ive fought for better health care for our National Guard better services for our veterans and more support for our Gold Star families, 3112, 3135
We cannot put the lives of our young men and women in uniform in Donald Trumps hands." Sixth we need to stay true to our values, 3135, 3161
"Trump says over and over againxa0The world is laughing at us.xa0Hes been sayingxa0this for decades he didnt just start this year." "He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987 when Ronald Reagan was President saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us, 3161, 3217
He was wrong then and hes wrong now – and youve got to wonder why somebody who fundamentally has so little confidence in America and has felt that way for at least 30 years wants to be our President." "The truth is theres not a country in the world that can rival us, 3217, 3270
Its not just that we have the greatest military or that our economy is larger more durable more entrepreneurial than any in the world, 3270, 3294
Its also that Americans work harder dream bigger – and we never ever stop trying to make our country and world a better place." "So it really matters that Donald Trump says things that go against our deepest-held values, 3294, 3333
It matters when he says hell order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists, 3333, 3349
During the raid to kill bin Laden when every second counted our SEALs took the time to move the women and children in the compound to safety, 3349, 3376
Donald Trump may not get it but thats what honor looks like." And it also matters when he makes fun of disabled people calls women pigsproposes banning an entire religion from our country or plays coy with white supremacists, 3376, 3415
America stands up to countries that treat women like animals or people of different races religions or ethnicities as less human, 3415, 3436
What happens to the moral example we set – for the world and for our own children – if our President engages in bigotry? And by the way Mr, 3436, 3465
Trump – every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces, 3465, 3490
Donald Trump Donald Trump could learn something from them, 3490, 3499
That brings me to the final point I want to make today – the temperament it takesto be Commander-in-Chief, 3499, 3518
"Every President faces hard choices every day with imperfect information and conflicting imperatives, 3518, 3531
Thats the job." A revolution threatens to topple a government in a key region an adversary reaches out for the first time in years – what do you do? "Making the right call takes a cool head and respect for the facts, 3531, 3573
It takes a willingness to listen to other peoples points of view with a truly open mind, 3573, 3590
It also takes humility – knowing you dont know everything – because if youre convinced youre always right youll never ask yourself the hard questions." "I remember being in the Situation Room with President Obama debating the potential Bin Laden operation, 3590, 3631
The Presidents advisors were divided, 3631, 3636
The intelligence was compelling but far from definitive, 3636, 3644
The risks of failure were daunting, 3644, 3650
The stakes were significant for our battle against al Qaeda and our relationship with Pakistan, 3650, 3665
Most of all the lives of those brave SEALs and helicopter pilots hung in the balance." "It was a decision only the President could make, 3665, 3690
And when he did it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as Ive ever seen." "Now imagine Donald Trump sitting in the Situation Room making life-or-death decisions on behalf of the United States, 3690, 3726
Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle, 3726, 3738
Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when hes angry but Americas entire arsenal." Do we want him making those calls – someone thin-skinned and quick to anger who lashes out at the smallest criticism? Do we want his finger anywhere near the button? "I have a lot of faith that the American people will make the right decision, 3738, 3802
This is a country with a deep reservoir of common sense and national pride, 3802, 3816
Were all counting on that." "Because making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake, 3816, 3832
It would undo so much of the work that Republicans and Democrats alike have done over many decades to make America stronger and more secure, 3832, 3857
It would set back our standing in the world more than anything in recent memory, 3857, 3872
And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that were fearful not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us instead of shaping our own destiny." "Thats not the America I know and love." "So yes we have a lot of work to do to keep our country secure, 3872, 3929
And we need to do better by American families and American workers – and we will, 3929, 3945
But dont let anyone tell you that America isnt great, 3945, 3955
Donald Trumps got America all wrong, 3955, 3961
We are a big-hearted fair-minded country." "There is no challenge we cant meet no goal we cant achieve when we each do our part and come together as one nation." Every lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together, 3961, 4003
We remember that every Memorial Day, 4003, 4009
This election is a choice between two very different visions of America, 4009, 4021
"One thats angry afraid and based on the idea that America is fundamentally weak and in decline." The other is hopeful generous and confident in the knowledge that America is great – just like we always have been, 4021, 4059
"Lets resolve that we can be greater still, 4059, 4067
That is what I believe in my heart." "I went to 112 countries as your Secretary of State, 4067, 4085
And I never lost my sense of pride at seeing our blue-and-white plane lit up on some far-off runway with? ?The United States of Americaxa0emblazoned on the side, 4085, 4113
That plane – those words – our country represents something special not just to us to the world, 4113, 4131
It represents freedom and hope and opportunity." "I love this country and I know you do too, 4131, 4148
Its been an honor and a privilege toserve America and Im going to do everything I can to protect our nation and make sure we dont lose sight of how strong we really are." Thank you all very much, 4148, 4187
