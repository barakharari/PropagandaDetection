Dear Wells Fargo Customers "In America we have faith that when we open up a checking account we arent opening ourselves up to being scammed, 0, 25
xa0Whether you use a local credit union or community bank or one of the big national chains we take it for granted that those institutions are fulfilling this basic responsibility to their consumers." "Thats why I was deeply disturbed when last week we found out that Wells Fargo had engaged in widespread illegal practices over many years, 25, 82
xa0The bank secretly opened up millions of accounts for customers without their consent – betraying their customers misusing their personal information and leading many to be slapped with unjust fees and other charges, 82, 115
Today Wells Fargos CEO will appear before Congress, 115, 123
He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch." There is simply no place for this kind of outrageous behavior in America, 123, 152
Our economy depends on a strong and safe banking system to help keep it moving, 152, 167
xa0But even after Americans spent years working hard to recover from the Great Recession the culture of misconduct and recklessness that preceded that crisis too often persists, 167, 194
I have a plan to address it, 194, 201
"First we need to defend the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 201, 211
xa0The unfair and abusive practices at Wells Fargo remind us that we need tough watchdogs looking out for customers, 211, 230
xa0The CFPB worked with local authorities and enforced the law – assessing its highest penalty ever and bringing the banks illegal activity into the national spotlight." "Donald Trump the Republican Party and Wall Street lobbyists are desperate to dismantle this effective agency which is dedicated solely to protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, 230, 284
xa0I wont let them put the CFPB under their thumb, 284, 294
xa0Ill protect the CFPB and make sure it can continue its essential work on behalf of the American people." "Second we need real consequences when firms on Wall Street break the law, 294, 326
This past week we learned that one of the Wells Fargo executives that oversaw the division that ripped off its customers left the bank – not with a pink slip but with a $125 million payout, 326, 362
xa0Its hard to imagine that top executives were unaware of a problem that involved thousands of the firms employees, 362, 381
xa0After all they imposed sales targets and compensation incentives in ways that led to this behavior, 381, 397
xa0And its frustrating that a bank can simply pay a fine and keep doing business as usual – with massive compensation for the executives responsible, 397, 422
xa0That compensation should be clawed back." "Ive put forward an agenda to enhance accountability on Wall Street, 422, 439
Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch, 439, 453
xa0Their compensation should take a hit if their companies pay major fines, 453, 465
xa0And they must face appropriate legal consequences if they break the law." "Third we need to make sure that no financial institution is too big to manage, 465, 492
xa0Ill put additional safeguards in place to address the risks that the big banks continue to pose to our system, 492, 512
xa0And if any bank cant be managed effectively it should be broken up." "Ill appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers not with big banks and their friends in Congress, 512, 544
xa0Ill fight hard to make sure that Wall Street is working for Main Street – not the other way around." "We need to keep pushing to make the financial system safer and fairer, 544, 577
Lets do it together." Sincerely Hillary Clinton , 577, 584
