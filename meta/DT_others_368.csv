Friends delegates and fellow Americans: I humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States, 0, 19
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Together we will lead our party back to the White House and we will lead our country back to safety prosperity and peace, 19, 45
We will be a country of generosity and warmth, 45, 54
But we will also be a country of law and order, 54, 65
Our Convention occurs at a moment of crisis for our nation, 65, 76
The attacks on our police and the terrorism in our cities threaten our very way of life, 76, 93
Any politician who does not grasp this danger is not fit to lead our country, 93, 108
Americans watching this address tonight have seen the recent images of violence in our streets and the chaos in our communities, 108, 129
Many have witnessed this violence personally some have even been its victims, 129, 141
I have a message for all of you: the crime and violence that today afflicts our nation will soon – and I mean very soon – come to an end, 141, 171
Beginning on January 20th of 2017 safety will be restored, 171, 181
The most basic duty of government is to defend the lives of its own citizens, 181, 196
Any government that fails to do so is a government unworthy to lead, 196, 209
It is finally time for a straightforward assessment of the state of our nation, 209, 223
I will present the facts plainly and honestly, 223, 231
We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore, 231, 240
So if you want to hear the corporate spin the carefully-crafted lies and the media myths the Democrats are holding their convention next week, 240, 264
Go there, 264, 266
But here at our convention there will be no lies, 266, 276
We will honor the American people with the truth and nothing else, 276, 288
These are the facts: "Decades of progress made in bringing down crime are now being reversed by this Administrations rollback of criminal enforcement." "Homicides last year increased by 17 percent in Americas fifty largest cities, 288, 323
Thats the largest increase in 25 years, 323, 330
In our nations capital killings have risen by 50 percent, 330, 340
They are up nearly 60 percent in nearby Baltimore." "In the Presidents hometown of Chicago more than 2000 people have been the victim of shootings this year alone, 340, 368
And almost 4000 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office." The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50 percent compared to this point last year, 368, 405
Nearly 180000 illegal immigrants with criminal records ordered deported from our country are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens, 405, 425
The number of new illegal immigrant families who have crossed the border so far this year already exceeds the entire total from 2015, 425, 448
They are being released by the tens of thousands into our communities with no regard for the impact on public safety or resources, 448, 471
One such border-crosser was released and made his way to Nebraska, 471, 482
There he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root, 482, 495
She was 21 years-old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4.0 Grade Point Average, 495, 514
Number one in her class, 514, 519
Her killer was then released a second time and he is now a fugitive from the law, 519, 536
"Ive met Sarahs beautiful family, 536, 541
But to this Administration their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasnt worth protecting, 541, 558
No more, 558, 560
One more child to sacrifice on the order and on the altar of open borders, 560, 575
What about our economy?" Again I will tell you the plain facts that have been edited out of your nightly news and your morning newspaper: Nearly Four in 10 African-American children are living in poverty while 58% of African American youth are now not employed, 575, 620
2 million more Latinos are in poverty today than when President Obama took his oath of office less than eight years ago, 620, 642
Another 14 million people have left the workforce entirely, 642, 651
"Household incomes are down more than $4000 since the year 2000, 651, 662
Our trade deficit in goods -- think of this -- our trade deficit reached nearly $800 billion last year alone, 662, 682
Were going to fix that." The budget is no better, 682, 692
President Obama has doubled our national debt to more than $19 trillion and growing, 692, 706
And yet what do we have to show for it? Our roads and bridges are falling apart our airports are Third World condition and forty-three million Americans are on food stamps, 706, 737
Now let us consider the state of affairs abroad, 737, 746
Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster but they have lived through one international humiliation after another, 746, 764
One after another, 764, 767
We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint, 767, 786
This was just prior to the signing of the Iran deal which gave back to Iran $150 billion and gave us absoltely nothing – it will go down in history as one of the worst deals ever negotiated, 786, 824
Another humiliation came when president Obama drew a red line in Syria – and the whole world knew it meant absolutely nothing, 824, 846
"In Libya our consulate – the symbol of American prestige around the globe – was brought down in flames, 846, 865
America is far less safe – and the world is far less stable – than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of Americas foreign policy." "Lets defeat her in November OK." "I am certain it is a decision President Obama truly regrets, 865, 912
Her bad instincts and her bad judgment – something pointed out by Bernie Sanders – are what caused so many of the disasters unfolding today, 912, 937
Lets review the record." In 2009 pre-Hillary ISIS was not even on the map.Libya was stable, 937, 953
Egypt was peaceful, 953, 956
Iraq was seeing a big big reduction in violence, 956, 965
Iran was being choked by sanctions, 965, 971
Syria was somewhat under control, 971, 976
After four years of Hillary Clinton what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region and the world, 976, 995
Libya is in ruins and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers, 995, 1016
Egypt was turned over to the radical Muslim brotherhood forcing the military to retake control, 1016, 1031
Iraq is in chaos, 1031, 1035
Iran is on the path to nuclear weapons, 1035, 1043
Syria is engulfed in a civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens the West, 1043, 1058
After fifteen years of wars in the Middle East after trillions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost the situation is worse than it has ever been before, 1058, 1087
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death destruction terrorism and weakness, 1087, 1099
"But Hillary Clintons legacy does not have to be Americas legacy, 1099, 1110
The problems we face now – poverty and violence at home war and destruction abroad – will last only as long as we continue relying on the same politicians who created them in the first place, 1110, 1146
A change in leadership is required to produce a change in outcomes, 1146, 1158
Tonight I will share with you my plan of action for America." The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents is that our plan will put America First, 1158, 1190
Americanism not globalism will be our credo, 1190, 1197
As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect the respect we deserve, 1197, 1229
The American People will come first once again, 1229, 1237
My plan will begin with safety at home – which means safe neighborhoods secure borders and protection from terrorism, 1237, 1256
There can be no prosperity without law and order, 1256, 1265
On the economy I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America, 1265, 1290
"A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nations most powerful special interests, 1290, 1312
That is because these interests have rigged our political and economic system for their exclusive benefit, 1312, 1328
Believe me its for their benefit." Big business elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place, 1328, 1361
They are throwing money at her because they have total control over every single thing she does, 1361, 1378
She is their puppet and they pull the strings, 1378, 1387
"That is why Hillary Clintons message is that things will never change...never ever, 1387, 1400
My message is that things have to change – and they have to change right now, 1400, 1416
Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across this nation that have been neglected ignored and abandoned." "I have visited the laid-off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals, 1416, 1459
These are the forgotten men and women of our country, 1459, 1469
And they are forgotten but theyre not going to be forgotten long, 1469, 1481
People who work hard but no longer have a voice." I am your voice! I have embraced crying mothers who have lost their children because our politicians put their personal agendas before the national good, 1481, 1516
disruption in the audience How great are our police? And how great is Cleveland? I have no patience for injustice no tolerance for government incompetence no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens, 1516, 1549
"When innocent people suffer because our political system lacks the will or the courage or the basic decency to enforce our laws – or still worse still has sold out to some corporate lobbyist for cash – I am not able to look the other way and I wont look the other way." "And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server deletes 33000 of them so the authorities cant see her crime puts our country at risk lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence – I know that corruption has reached a level like never ever before in our country." When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was "extremely careless" and "negligent" in handling our classified secrets I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did, 1549, 1693
They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible terrible crimes, 1693, 1708
In fact her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it – especially when others who have done far less have paid so dearly, 1708, 1739
When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions and millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come, 1739, 1770
I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves, 1770, 1791
Nobody knows the system better than me which is why I alone can fix it, 1791, 1806
I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens just like it was rigged against Bernie Sanders – he never had a chance, 1806, 1832
But his supporters will join our movement because we will fix his biggest single issue: trade deals that strip us of our jobs and strip us of our wealth as a country, 1832, 1864
Millions of Democrats will join our movement because we are going to fix the system so it works justly for each and every American, 1864, 1888
In this cause I am proud to have at my side the next Vice President of the United States: Governor Mike Pence of Indiana, 1888, 1912
And a great guy, 1912, 1916
We will bring the same economic success to America that Mike brought to Indiana which is amazing, 1916, 1933
He is a man of character and accomplishment, 1933, 1941
He is the man for the job, 1941, 1948
The first task for our new Administration will be to liberate our citizens from the crime and terrorism and lawlessness that threatens their communities, 1948, 1972
America was shocked to its core when our police officers in Dallas were so brutally executed, 1972, 1988
In the days after Dallas we have seen continued threats and violence against our law enforcement officials, 1988, 2005
Law officers have been shot or killed in recent days in Georgia Missouri Wisconsin Kansas Michigan and Tennessee, 2005, 2023
On Sunday more police were gunned down in Baton Rouge Louisiana, 2023, 2034
Three were killed and three were very very badly injured, 2034, 2044
An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans, 2044, 2055
I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year I will restore law and order to our country, 2055, 2093
Believe me believe me, 2093, 2097
I will work with and appoint the best and prosecutors and law enforcement officials to get the job properly done, 2097, 2117
In this race for the White House I am the law and order candidate, 2117, 2131
The irresponsible rhetoric of our President who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone than frankly I have ever seen and anybody in this room has ever watched or seen, 2131, 2177
"This Administration has failed Americas inner cities, 2177, 2184
Remember: it has failed Americas inner cities, 2184, 2191
Its failed them on education, 2191, 2196
Its failed them on jobs, 2196, 2201
Its failed them on crime, 2201, 2206
Its failed them at every level." When I am President I will work to ensure that all of our kids are treated equally and protected equally, 2206, 2232
Every action I take I will ask myself: does this make better for young Americans in Baltimore in Chicago in Detroit in Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child America? Any other child, 2232, 2275
To make life safe in America we must also address the growing threats we face from outside the country: We are going to defeat the barbarians of ISIS and we are going to defeat them fast, 2275, 2311
Once again France is the victim of brutal Islamic terrorism, 2311, 2321
Men women and children viciously mowed down, 2321, 2328
Lives ruined, 2328, 2330
Families ripped apart, 2330, 2333
A nation in mourning, 2333, 2337
The damage and devastation that can be inflicted by Islamic radicals has been proven over and over – at the World Trade Center at an office party in San Bernardino at the Boston Marathon and a military recruiting center in Chattanooga Tennessee, 2337, 2379
And many many other locations, 2379, 2384
"Only weeks ago in Orlando Florida 49 wonderful Americans were savagely murdered by an Islamic terrorist, 2384, 2400
This time the terrorist targeted LGBTQ community – no good and were going to stop it." As your President I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology – beleive me, 2400, 2444
And as a Republican it is so nice to hear you cheering for what I just said, 2444, 2461
Thank you, 2461, 2463
To protect us from terrorism we need to focus on three things, 2463, 2475
"We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world, 2475, 2486
We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq Libya Egypt and Syria, 2486, 2508
Instead we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying ISIS and stamping out Islamic terrorism and doing it now doing it quickly, 2508, 2536
Were going to win, 2536, 2540
Were going to win fast." This includes working with our greatest ally in the region the State of Israel, 2540, 2559
Recently I have said that NATO was obsolete because it did not properly cover terror and also that many of the member countries were not paying their fair share, 2559, 2588
As usual the United States has been picking up the cost, 2588, 2599
Shortly thereafter it was announced that NATO will be setting up a new program in order to combat terrorism -- a true step in the right direction, 2599, 2626
"Lastly and very importantly we must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place, 2626, 2656
We dont want them in our country." "My opponent has called for a radical 550% increase in Syrian -- Think of this, 2656, 2678
Think of this, 2678, 2681
This is not believable but this is whats happening -- refugees on top of existing massive refugee flows coming into our country under President Obama, 2681, 2706
She proposes this despite the fact that theres no way to screen these refugees in order to find out who they are or where they come from." I only want to admit individuals into our country who will support our values and love our people, 2706, 2751
Anyone who endorses violence hatred or oppression is not welcome in our country and never ever will be, 2751, 2769
Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens especially for African-American and Latino workers, 2769, 2789
We are going to have an immigration system that works but one that works for the American people, 2789, 2807
On Monday we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza Sabine Durden and my friend Jamiel Shaw, 2807, 2831
They are just three brave representatives of many thousands who have suffered so gravely, 2831, 2845
Of all my travels in this country nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border which we can solve, 2845, 2884
We have to solve it, 2884, 2889
These families have no special interests to represent them, 2889, 2898
There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf, 2898, 2907
My opponent will never meet with them or share in their pain believe me, 2907, 2921
Instead my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities, 2921, 2927
But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann and Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other -- oh it is so sad to even be talking about it because we can fix this problem so quickly -- Americans who have been so brutally murdered and who have suffered so so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone, 2927, 2996
But they are alone no longer, 2996, 3002
Tonight this candidate and the whole nation stand in their corner to support them to send them our love and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering and the same awful fate, 3002, 3041
"We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration to stop the gangs and the violence and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities, 3041, 3071
I have been honored to receive the endorsement of Americas Border Patrol Agents and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful lawful lawful immigration system, 3071, 3101
Lawful." "By ending catch-and-release on the border we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence, 3101, 3118
Illegal border crossings will go down, 3118, 3124
We will stop it, 3124, 3128
It wont be happening very much anymore, 3128, 3135
Believe me, 3135, 3137
Peace will be restored, 3137, 3141
By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve." Tonight I want every American whose demands for immigration security have been denied – and every politician who has denied them – to listen very very closely to the words I am about to say, 3141, 3196
On January 20th of 2017 the day I take the oath of office Americans will finally wake up in a country where the laws of the United States are enforced, 3196, 3226
We are going to be considerate and compassionate to everyone, 3226, 3236
But my greatest compassion will be for our own struggling citizens, 3236, 3247
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! My plan is the exact opposite of the radical and dangerous immigration policy of Hillary Clinton, 3247, 3266
Americans want relief from uncontrolled immigration, 3266, 3272
Communities want relief, 3272, 3275
"Yet Hillary Clinton is proposing mass amnesty mass immigration and mass lawlessness, 3275, 3287
Her plan will overwhelm your schools and hospitals further reduce your jobs and wages and make it harder for recent immigrants to escape the tremendous cycle of poverty that theyre going through right now and make it almost impossible to join the middle class." "I have a different vision for our workers, 3287, 3339
It begins with a new fair trade policy that protects our jobs and stands up to countries that cheat of which there are many, 3339, 3363
Its been a signature message of my campaign from day one and it will be a signature feature of my presidency from the moment I take the oath of office." "I have made billions of dollars in business making deals – now Im going to make our country rich again, 3363, 3413
Using the richest people in the world which our country has I am going to turn our bad trade agreements into great trade agreements, 3413, 3437
America has lost nearly-one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton." Remember it was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA one of the worst economic deals ever made by our country -- or frankly any other country, 3437, 3486
Never ever again, 3486, 3489
I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan and all of America – and I am not going to let companies move to other countries firing their employees along the way without consequences, 3489, 3531
Not going to happen anymore, 3531, 3536
"My opponent on the other hand has supported virtually every trade agreement that has been destroying our middle class, 3536, 3555
She supported NAFTA and she supported Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization – another one of her husbands colossal mistakes and disasters." "She supported the job killing trade deal with South Korea, 3555, 3588
She has supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 3588, 3594
The TPP will not only destroy our manufacturing but it will make America subject to the rulings of foreign governments, 3594, 3614
And its not going to happen, 3614, 3620
I pledge to never sign any trade agreement that hurts our workers or that diminishes our freedom and independence, 3620, 3639
I will never ever sign bad trade deals, 3639, 3647
America fist again! America first! Instead I will make individual deals with individual countries." No longer will we enter into these massive transactions with many countries that are thousands of pages long – and which no one from our country even reads or understands, 3647, 3691
We are going to enforce all trade violations against any country including through the use of taxes and tariffs against any country that cheats, 3691, 3715
"This includes stopping Chinas outrageous theft of intellectual property along with their illegal product dumping and their devastating currency manipulation, 3715, 3735
They are the greatest that ever came about; they are the greatest currency manipulators ever! Our horrible trade agreements with China and many others will be totally renegotiated, 3735, 3763
That includes renegotiating NAFTA to get a much better deal for America – and well walk away if we dont get the deal that we want." We are going to start building and making things again, 3763, 3799
Next comes the reform of our tax laws regulations and energy rules, 3799, 3811
While Hillary Clinton plans a massive -- and I mean massive -- tax increase I have proposed the largest tax reduction of any candidate who has declared for the presidential race this year – Democrat or Republican, 3811, 3848
Middle-income Americans and businesses will experience profound relief and taxes will be greatly simplified for everyone and I mean everyone, 3848, 3868
America is one of the highest-taxed nations in the world, 3868, 3878
Reducing taxes will cause new companies and new jobs to come roaring back into our country, 3878, 3894
Believe me it will happen and it will happen fast, 3894, 3904
Then we are going to deal with the issue of regulation one of the greatest job-killers of them all, 3904, 3923
Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year and we will end it very very quickly, 3923, 3944
We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy, 3944, 3957
This will produce more than $20 trillion in job creating economic activity over the next four decades, 3957, 3974
My opponent on the other hand wants to put the great miners and steel workers of our country out of work and out of business – that will never happen with Donald Trump as President, 3974, 4009
Our steelworkers and our miners are going back to work again, 4009, 4020
With these new economic policies trillions of dollars will start flowing into our country, 4020, 4034
This new wealth will improve the quality of life for all Americans – We will build the roads highways bridges tunnels airports and the railways of tomorrow, 4034, 4061
This in turn will create millions more jobs, 4061, 4069
We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice, 4069, 4089
"My opponent would rather protect bureaucrats than serve American children, 4089, 4099
And thats what shes doing and thats what shes done, 4099, 4109
We will repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, 4109, 4116
You will be able to choose your own doctor again, 4116, 4126
And we will fix TSA at the airports which is a total disaster!" Thank you, 4126, 4141
Thank you, 4141, 4143
We are going to work with all of our students who are drowning in debt to take the pressure off these young people just starting out their adult lives, 4143, 4172
We will completely rebuild our depleted military and the countries that we protect at a massive loss will be asked to pay their fair share, 4172, 4197
We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before, 4197, 4214
My just-released Ten Point Plan has received tremendous veteran support, 4214, 4224
We will guarantee those who serve this country will be able to visit the doctor or hospital of their choice without waiting five days in line and dying, 4224, 4252
"My opponent dismissed the VA scandal as being not widespread – one more sign of how out of touch she really is, 4252, 4274
We are going to ask every Department Head in government to provide a list of wasteful spending projects that we can eliminate in my first 100 days, 4274, 4301
The politicians have talked about it Im going to do it." We are also going to appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution, 4301, 4333
The replacement for our beloved Justice Scalia will be a person of similar views and judicial philosophies, 4333, 4350
Very important, 4350, 4352
This will be one of the most important issues decided by this election, 4352, 4365
My opponent wants to essentially abolish the 2nd amendment, 4365, 4374
I on the other hand received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association and will protect the right of all Americans to keep their families safe, 4374, 4403
"At this moment I would like to thank the evangelical and religious community because Ill tell you what the support they have given me and Im not sure I totally deserve it has been so amazing and has had such a big reason for me being here tonight, 4403, 4451
So true, 4451, 4453
They have so much to contribute to our politics yet our laws prevent you from speaking your minds from your own pulpits, 4453, 4475
An amendment pushed by Lyndon Johnson many years ago threatens religious institutions with a loss of their tax-exempt status if they openly advocate their political views, 4475, 4501
Their voice has been taken away." I am going to work very hard to repeal that language and protect free speech for all Americans, 4501, 4525
We can accomplish these great things and so much else – all we need to do is start believing in ourselves and in our country again, 4525, 4551
Start believing, 4551, 4553
It is time to show the whole world that America Is Back – bigger and better and stronger than ever before, 4553, 4574
"In this journey Im so lucky to have at my side my wife Melania and my wonderful children Don Ivanka Eric Tiffany and Barron: you will always be my greatest source of pride and joy, 4574, 4609
And by the way Melania and Ivanka -- did they do a job? My Dad Fred Trump was the smartest and hardest working man I ever knew, 4609, 4636
I wonder sometimes what hed say if he were here to see this and to see me tonight." "Its because of him that I learned from my youngest age to respect the dignity of work and the dignity of working people, 4636, 4677
He was a guy most comfortable in the company of bricklayers carpenters and electricians and I have a lot of that in me also, 4677, 4701
I love those people." "Then theres my mother Mary, 4701, 4710
She was strong but also warm and fair-minded, 4710, 4718
She was a truly great mother, 4718, 4724
She was also one of the most honest and charitable people I have ever known and a great judge of character, 4724, 4745
She could pick em out from anywhere." To my sisters Mary Anne and Elizabeth my brother Robert and my late brother Fred I will always give you my love you are most special to me, 4745, 4780
I have loved my life in business, 4780, 4787
"But now my sole and exclusive mission is to go to work for our country – to go to work for all of you, 4787, 4811
Its time to deliver a victory for the American people, 4811, 4821
We dont win anymore but we are going to start winning again, 4821, 4833
But to do that we must break free from the petty politics of the past." America is a nation of believers dreamers and strivers that is being led by a group of censors critics and cynics, 4833, 4869
"Remember: All of the people telling you that you cant have the country you want are the same people that wouldnt stand -- I mean they said Trump doesnt have a chance of being here tonight, 4869, 4905
Not a chance! The same people, 4905, 4911
Oh we love defeating those people dont we? Love it love it love it, 4911, 4925
No longer can we rely on those same people in politics and in the media who will say anything to keep a rigged system in place, 4925, 4951
Instead we must choose to Believe In America." History is watching us now, 4951, 4964
"Its waiting to see if we will rise to the occasion and if we will show the whole world that America is still free and independent and strong, 4964, 4992
Im asking for your support tonight so that I can be your champion in the White House." My opponent asks her supporters to recite a three-word loyalty pledge, 4992, 5020
It reads: "Im With Her", 5020, 5025
I choose to recite a different pledge, 5025, 5032
My pledge reads: "IM WITH YOU – THE AMERICAN PEOPLE." I am your voice, 5032, 5046
"So to every parent who dreams for their child and every child who dreams for their future I say these words to you tonight: Im With You and I will fight for you and I will win for you." To all Americans tonight in all our cities and towns I make this promise: We Will Make America Strong Again, 5046, 5105
We Will Make America Proud Again, 5105, 5111
We Will Make America Safe Again, 5111, 5117
And We Will Make America Great Again, 5117, 5124
God bless you and good night! I love you! , 5124, 5133
