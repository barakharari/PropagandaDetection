The stories behind the votes Tens of millions of votes will be cast during the 2016 presidential election, 0, 18
"And behind the vote totals the margins of victory and the delegate counts are the individual votes themselves, 18, 36
Each one of those votes tells a story, 36, 44
A vote represents a persons beliefs concerns hopes and dreams for the future—and every person has his or her own journey to the ballot box." n n I taught in Harlem, 44, 75
That job showed me the horrifying reality of the school-to-prison pipeline, 75, 86
We are on the verge of entering a world where we have the most unequal generation ever—and I am not talking about income inequality, 86, 110
I am talking about unequal in terms of opportunity for kids, 110, 121
And this inequality is sickening when you look at it from a racial perspective because it appears to me that black kids are being automatically set up to be fed through this pipeline—which sets them up for lifelong inequality, 121, 160
"Before I started teaching I never understood what the school-to-prison pipeline even meant, 160, 173
But I had one student who was incredibly intelligent and I sort of saw it through him, 173, 190
A lot of what happened to him has to do with the structural inequalities that are in place in our laws policies and communities in general, 190, 216
But part of it is that black boys are not being educated in the same way that their peers are, 216, 236
I felt like the structures that were in place were resistant to African American male success, 236, 252
Everything was designed to prevent success even in the educational system, 252, 263
And community programs are doing great work—but its not enough with an issue like this, 263, 278
In order to successfully address this issue you need a leader in the White House who is familiar with the issue and is willing to tackle these sorts of issues with policy." "Its absolutely a big part of why, 278, 317
I know that this is an issue that she cares about, 317, 328
She has worked on these issues and shes demonstrated that she has a familiarity with these issues that no other candidate has—on the Republican side or the Democratic side, 328, 357
I care about these issues because I have seen it first hand, 357, 369
I have seen what it does to communities, 369, 377
And so has she, 377, 381
She has that knowledge, 381, 385
When you have a generation of black men that are being incarcerated and are barely making it through school because they are going through the prison system first that is affecting the black families and that is in turn affecting the productivity of this country, 385, 430
That is something we need to address immediately, 430, 438
I think she is the best to do it." n n ? "I am a first-generation American, 438, 455
I am a first-generation college student, 455, 461
I am the first person in my family to go to law school, 461, 474
Im particularly very interested in voting rights and campaign finance reform, 474, 485
These two issues have really framed both why I have wanted to go to law school and why I want to help people after, 485, 509
I believe law school is a place where I can impact a lot of change in these areas, 509, 527
I dont have to look a certain way to do it, 527, 538
I dont have to come from a certain background to do it, 538, 550
I can really achieve my dreams.?" "When she acknowledged white privilege towards the end of the speech I was very surprised by that, 550, 573
I dont think people would expect something like that from a major presidential candidate, 573, 587
I was very satisfied to come out of that speech knowing thats where she was in terms of fully acknowledging both her privilege and white privilege, 587, 613
And not just as something that might exist but something that we have to talk about in our society if we hope to make progress at achieving racial justice.?" It demonstrated that this is not something she started caring about yesterday, 613, 654
This is something that she has been fighting for for years, 654, 665
Seeing her here in Harlem talking about white privilege really reiterated for me that this has been part of a decades-long commitment to fighting for racial justice, 665, 692
Specifically she speaks with the community and actually listens to find out what the issues are that we care about and hope our president will solve, 692, 718
I think that this speech in particular and that moment in acknowledging white privilege was the product of years of listening to the black community hearing our concerns and hopes for America and the visions that we have of a more equal society, 718, 761
For me I respect that a lot, 761, 768
It shows that she is not just a doer but also a listener, 768, 781
Well Ive always supported her but something I love about her which I just recently found out is that when she was very young she worked with Marian Wright Edelman founder of the Childrens Defense Fund, 781, 817
So I did some research and I found out that even as a fresh college graduate she was very much involved in doing things for children, 817, 843
When she was just out of undergrad "separate but equal" had been outlawed but "segregation academies" were still around in the South, 843, 865
So in order to investigate these kinds of schools she went to the South and pretended to be a mother who was interested in enrolling her children in a school that didnt allow black children, 865, 900
I love that so much, 900, 905
That takes a lot of chutzpah to do especially at that age, 905, 917
And that shows you her mindset, 917, 923
Shes always been like this, 923, 928
Shes always wanted to help people, 928, 934
"The inequity that we experience as black Americans especially when it comes to being arrested, 934, 949
Iowa has a really high rate of black young men incarcerated, 949, 960
We need to do something about that, 960, 967
I believe that Hillary will, 967, 972
And I believe that she has the right approach to fixing this because it is a complicated issue, 972, 990
You cant right this wrong in a year, 990, 998
It didnt take a year for this to happen and its going to take some time for us to straighten it out correctly, 998, 1021
These are complex issues and I like that she is a person who sees all parts of the problem and tries to work on each one, 1021, 1047
That means a lot to me." "So Ive never understood the impulse that makes some people want to be president, 1047, 1067
You couldnt pay me enough, 1067, 1072
It seems like such a thankless job, 1072, 1079
But with her I get it, 1079, 1085
I see her and I see that she wants to get in there and help as many people as humanly possible and she knows that as president she will, 1085, 1114
That selflessness to me it what makes her the most qualified especially when you put it on top of all of her experience, 1114, 1137
Shes not only ready but she wants the job for the right reasons." I have! I got to meet her about a week before the caucuses and it was amazing, 1137, 1167
When I met her I told her that she gave a speech that inspired me to run for school board in my district, 1167, 1190
And she lit up! She squeezed my hand and she asked me "How did it go?" I told her "I won!" She said "Im so proud of you thats incredible!" This woman who is so accomplished and has done so much told me that shes proud of me, 1190, 1238
Thats insane, 1238, 1240
And it was genuine! I know its not the popular opinion—that shes a real person with feelings and emotions—but when I was talking to her I felt like we were the only people in that room, 1240, 1276
During that speech she talked about the importance of electing Democrats on every single level—city state federal all of it—and she was so passionate about democracy and politics really being local and being something that you have to involve yourself in, 1276, 1317
And she used that John Wesley quote: "Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can." That really spoke to me, 1317, 1347
I had been considering doing something for a while and that was the push I needed, 1347, 1363
"We have made so much progress as a nation recently, 1363, 1373
And its not abstract progress—its progress that helps everyday families in a very tangible way, 1373, 1388
But that progress is not secure, 1388, 1394
Its very tenuous and it could all be undone in an instant, 1394, 1406
I believe that Hillary can truly protect our progress, 1406, 1415
Not just because shes a strong smart woman—which she is obviously—but because after meeting her I know that shes the kind of person who can get things done, 1415, 1443
Shes so genuine—and she cares so much about people—that I know she will do everything she can to help everyone she can, 1443, 1465
I believe in her." "Porter is my youngest—I also have a son whos 13, 1465, 1479
She is as my wife would say the most thoughtful caring and sweet little girl; but actually she absolutely has a streak of independence and decisiveness in her, 1479, 1507
She loves superheroes over Barbies—she puts her Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in her backpack right along with her Barbies and the Ninja Turtles all live in her Barbie house." "I worry about children, 1507, 1540
I worry about mine of course—but I worry about all the other children who dont have the access or the opportunity that my children do, 1540, 1565
Fifty percent of the households in my community make less than $30000 a year, 1565, 1579
When I go into the high school and I offer the students an opportunity for employment at one of the major employers in Des Moines and they dont even know where that employers located that scares me, 1579, 1616
If we dont open these doors theyll never even know that the doors exist for them to walk through." "Ive been in Des Moines for the last 16 years so I was here to witness what Iowa did for Barack Obama, 1616, 1657
And having a son who is a black male I can now look him in the eyes and tell him that honestly with hard work and dedication he can become president of the United States, 1657, 1692
And with Secretary Clinton when she wins I will be able to look my daughter in the eyes and tell her the same thing, 1692, 1716
Thats why Im doing this—for her." "I was born and raised a Republican, 1716, 1729
I dont know that I ever put a lot of thought into it, 1729, 1742
In 2008 I lost my job, 1742, 1748
And I know that didnt happen because of George W, 1748, 1758
Bush, 1758, 1759
It wasnt a political issue it was just economics and I paid the price for it, 1759, 1775
I wasnt able to get another job for 19 months and in those 19 months I applied to 412 jobs, 1775, 1795
At that time I was a devoted Fox News follower and heres Steve King our great congressman from northwest Iowa and Jon Kyl who was a senator from Arizona telling people that the long-term unemployed were lazy and we were a drain on the economy, 1795, 1840
I knew that was a lie, 1840, 1846
I wasnt lazy, 1846, 1849
But those lawmakers didnt want to understand this issue, 1849, 1858
They wanted to cast doubt and divide people because that was politically expedient for them, 1858, 1873
And that was when I realized that the party I grew up with had left me, 1873, 1889
So in 2008 I became a Democrat because from what I saw the Republican Party just completely walked away from their social responsibility—but Democrats were there and they were ready to actually help people." Oh Ill never forget it, 1889, 1928
It was 2008 and she was at a town hall, 1928, 1938
Someone asked her a very simple question: "How do you do it?" Before this my wife had always been an avid Hillary Clinton supporter and I was not, 1938, 1966
But her answer to that question which was very real and genuine—that got my attention, 1966, 1981
And I started looking at Hillary Clinton in a much different light, 1981, 1993
You could tell that this person had put everything she had into this race, 1993, 2007
And it was very meaningful to her, 2007, 2014
She was giving it everything she had, 2014, 2021
She could have easily said "Ive had enough, 2021, 2029
I cant do this anymore." But she didnt, 2029, 2037
She stuck it out, 2037, 2041
Which should have proved to anybody: This is a very tough human being, 2041, 2054
"We met her at the Iowa fairgrounds, 2054, 2061
And it was awesome, 2061, 2065
The minute she hit the room the room changed, 2065, 2074
She had a big smile, 2074, 2079
She was happy to see everybody, 2079, 2085
She doesnt overtake the room she works right into the room, 2085, 2096
Her presence is with you, 2096, 2101
Not above you not at you but with you, 2101, 2110
It was a fantastic opportunity, 2110, 2115
And you know whats great? When you get to talk to her even for a minute she will stop and she will look you dead square in the eye and talk to you, 2115, 2148
There can be three five hundred people around you and that conversation is one-on-one, 2148, 2162
Thats an amazing thing." "The injustice and inequalities that refugees have to deal with in our society, 2162, 2179
Ive worked very closely with refugees in the past, 2179, 2188
The refugee resettlement system has been around a very long time but it hasnt changed for the better in a while, 2188, 2209
I feel—and every refugee feels—grateful for the fact that weve received a second chance at life by getting to come here, 2209, 2230
But its kind of an assembly-line system where its in and out in and out, 2230, 2245
I think when youre dealing with human life thats not fair." And I want to add: Being a first-generation immigrant I feel like I deal with different kinds of biases and discriminations every day in many ways, 2245, 2282
I worry about my kids being able to integrate well in the community and that they will be accepted equally, 2282, 2302
"I am a great supporter of President Obama and I feel like she is the only person who will continue the great work that he has started and build on his legacy, 2302, 2334
And Hillarys and my values are similar, 2334, 2341
Being a diverse community member from a diverse background I feel like she understands me and people like me and shes supportive of our issues." "She sees injustice, 2341, 2369
She sees a system that she can help make better, 2369, 2379
I relate to that, 2379, 2383
I appreciate her fighting for us for the right things, 2383, 2393
Im from Nepal, 2393, 2396
Nepal is in a very dire situation right now and the U.S, 2396, 2408
government is not taking any stance on helping, 2408, 2416
I think someone like her—who is more aware about the different countries and has experience internationally—can really do something to help us, 2416, 2438
Its very lofty thinking but Im hopeful." "Im opening a business this summer and I think about that pretty much 24/7, 2438, 2459
Its a big undertaking, 2459, 2463
Im 35 years old and my business partners and I are taking on a lot to do a 5300-square-foot restaurant, 2463, 2483
Any time you do something creative you wonder how people will react to it and you hope everyone will like it, 2483, 2504
The build-up was very fun but its all just on paper until it opens, 2504, 2518
And then its real, 2518, 2522
I worry about how well do." "Yes: When Barack Obama chose Hillary Clinton to be secretary of state, 2522, 2540
She handled that so brilliantly, 2540, 2545
She worked harder than anybody I can remember in that position, 2545, 2556
She really truly was the ultimate ambassador for our country, 2556, 2566
And the truth is that shes been fighting for our country for her whole career—but I dont think that has ever shined brighter than it did during her time as secretary of state." "Well obviously experience is very important in a presidential candidate, 2566, 2609
You have to have experience to be president, 2609, 2617
And she does, 2617, 2620
But for me thats just the baseline, 2620, 2627
A president also needs to inspire passion, 2627, 2634
And in my mind shes done that, 2634, 2641
Over the course of her career she has inspired such a vast group of people from all sorts of backgrounds, 2641, 2661
I believe that we should always dream big but we also need to exist within the political realities of our time and work to get things done where we can, 2661, 2691
And she does that too, 2691, 2696
So for me its not just about experience and electability—its the total package." , 2696, 2709
