"Thank you, 0, 2
Thank you Temple! I am so delighted to be here with all of you, 2, 16
I saw how much fun President Obama had last week and – I wanted to be here in Philadelphia, 16, 35
Before I begin with my remarks I do want to say how proud I am of our brave first responders working to keep us safe after the attacks of the last weekend in New York New Jersey and Minnesota, 35, 74
There are now reports of a suspect in custody but we must remain vigilant, 74, 88
This is a fast-moving situation and a sobering reminder that we need steady leadership in a dangerous world, 88, 106
"Im here to talk about a number of the issues that are part of this election but really much more than that they are part of our future – the kind of country we want to have the kind of people we want to be and particularly what kind of opportunities we should be providing for the young people of America, 106, 167
I have a proud Owl on my staff Jamira Burley, 167, 177
A Philadelphia native who became an activist working to end the epidemic of gun violence right here in Philadelphia, 177, 196
She loves Temple and we love her, 196, 203
And I also want to thank Lauren for that introduction." "Jamira and Lauren are two examples of why I do have so much faith in our future, 203, 230
Your generation is the most inclusive progressive and entrepreneurial that weve ever seen, 230, 243
And as you heard when Lauren was in college she saw challenges facing students of color but there was no NAACP chapter to support them and promote diversity and inclusion on campus – so she started one, 243, 280
And Lauren remains committed and engaged working with an organization called Generation Progress because she understands that active citizenship is a lifelong job and the call to service never fades." "Now I know that with so much negativity out there it is really easy to get cynical – especially about our politics, 280, 332
I remember wrestling with that challenge when I was a student during the Vietnam War, 332, 347
It can be tempting to think that no one will tell you the truth and nothings ever going to change, 347, 367
But youre here today because you refuse to accept cynicism, 367, 377
You know that the next 50 days will shape the next 50 years, 377, 390
And you see how much needs fixing in our country from the soaring cost of college to the scourge of systemic racism to the threat from climate change – but you also know the only way we can meet those challenges is if we meet them together." "Youre here today because you believe we can do just that, 390, 448
You want something to vote for not just against, 448, 457
Optimism not resentment, 457, 460
Answers not anger, 460, 463
Ideas not insults, 463, 466
Bridges not walls, 466, 469
Youre also here because you know this election isnt a reality TV show, 469, 482
It shouldnt be about birth certificates or name-calling or stunts to get onto cable news." "This election comes down to a choice between two very different visions for America, 482, 511
I believe its wrong to tear each down, 511, 519
We should be lifting each other up, 519, 526
Its wrong to let income inequality get even worse, 526, 535
We have to make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top, 535, 550
And its wrong to put a loose cannon in charge who could start another war, 550, 565
We should work with our allies to keep us safe." It comes down to this: Are we going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides in this country or are we going to be as I know we can stronger together? "I know what I believe and Im going to close my campaign the same way I started my career – fighting for kids and young people and families, 565, 637
That has been the cause of my life, 637, 645
And it will be the passion of my presidency and I hope youll join me, 645, 660
We cant get distracted when the media or my opponent turns this election into a circus, 660, 676
My husband has a saying about that, 676, 683
He calls it majoring in the minors – getting so wrapped up in stuff that doesnt matter you forget whats really important to your future and to the future of this country." "Take the challenges facing young Americans today, 683, 722
First of all if youre willing to work hard you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark in the world, 722, 757
But thats been out of reach for too many young people – trying to find your footing in the wake of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, 757, 786
Thats why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to work with both parties and make a historic investment in good new jobs, 786, 809
We can create millions of jobs and make life a lot better by doing things like connecting every household to broadband by 2020; installing half a billion solar panels; building a cleaner more resilient electric grid with enough renewable energy to power every home in the country." Next getting an education should give you a boost not hold you back, 809, 869
But as you know better than most tuition keeps going through the roof and debt keeps piling up, 869, 887
I understand that Temple was founded to democratize diversify and widen the reach of higher education, 887, 903
That is still a vital goal, 903, 909
"So I worked with Bernie Sanders on a plan, 909, 918
We came up with a plan that makes public college tuition-free for working families and debt-free for everyone, 918, 936
And if you already have debt we will help you refinance it and pay it back as a percentage of your income so youre never on the hook for more than you can afford, 936, 970
You can actually see how much you and your family can save under our plan by looking at the College Calculator at hillaryclinton.com." "And heres something we dont talk about enough: a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job in America, 970, 1016
People should be able to learn a skill practice a trade and making a good living because of that, 1016, 1035
So were offering new tax credits to encourage companies to offer paid apprenticeships that let you earn while you learn and do more to dignify skills across the board – for welders machinists health technicians coders and so many other fields." "Another challenge I hear about all the time is from new parents about how hard it is to balance the demands of work and family in todays economy, 1035, 1104
Families look different today than they did decades ago I think we can all agree, 1104, 1119
Most need two incomes just to get by, 1119, 1127
And many people now change jobs frequently and have wildly unpredictable schedules or they have to cobble together part-time work all without the basic supports available to parents in nearly every other advanced country." "Thats why Tim Kaine and I have a plan to help working families with quality affordable childcare preschool and paid family leave, 1127, 1183
We fundamentally believe – the more we can strengthen families the stronger we will be as a nation." "Everywhere I go young people also share their concerns about the divisiveness and discrimination we see in America today, 1183, 1220
You arent – and you shouldnt be – satisfied with the progress weve made, 1220, 1234
You should keep wanting to right wrongs and fight for justice and dignify for all, 1234, 1249
We see as Lauren said too many young black men and women made to feel like their lives are disposable; too many immigrants living in fear of deportation; too many young LGBT Americans bullied; too many young women and men sexually assaulted on campus or in the military or at home, 1249, 1300
And more than previous generations you understand that all these challenges are intersecting and we must take them on together." "But you also see a Republican nominee for president who incites hatred and violence like weve never seen before in any campaign, 1300, 1342
Hate speech being normalized, 1342, 1346
The dog whistles are out in the open, 1346, 1354
And yet despite this I remain convinced Americas best days are ahead of us, 1354, 1368
In large part thats because of the inspiring young people I meet every day." "Im inspired by Astrid, 1368, 1386
I met her in Las Vegas last summer, 1386, 1394
She was brought to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll a cross and the dress she was wearing, 1394, 1420
Now shes in her twenties and advocating for the rights of undocumented Americans and comprehensive immigration reform, 1420, 1437
We should all join her in this." "Im inspired by Mikey who I met in New York, 1437, 1454
Mikey spent six months in prison for a low-level drug offense, 1454, 1465
After he got out Mikey discovered just how hard it is for people whove done their time to find good jobs and opportunities, 1465, 1488
But he persisted and he managed to start his own ice cream shop in New York – and I can recommend its delicious, 1488, 1511
We have to do more to help others get that second chance including by banning the box and reforming our criminal justice system." "Im inspired by Erica one of the bravest young women Ive ever met, 1511, 1547
Her mother Dawn was the principal of Sandy Hook School who died trying to protect her students, 1547, 1564
Erica was devastated, 1564, 1567
But then she made it her mission to advocate for commonsense gun safety reforms, 1567, 1581
Its been painful for her – a lot of hate has come her way and the gun lobby is so powerful – but Erica wont give up, 1581, 1608
As she said What if everyone who faced tough odds said its hard so Im going to walk away? Thats not the type of world I want to live in." "Thats the spirit that makes this country great – we might get knocked down but we get right back up again, 1608, 1659
And we refuse to quit no matter what, 1659, 1667
And thats the spirit we need in this election too." "Now I know that with Washington paralyzed by big money and partisanship the gap between the change we want and the progress that politics should deliver can look like a chasm, 1667, 1708
I also know that even if youre totally opposed to Donald Trump you may still have some questions about me, 1708, 1728
I get that, 1728, 1731
And I want to do my best to answer those questions." "When it comes to public service the service part has always easier for me than the public part, 1731, 1760
I will never be the showman my opponent is – and you know what thats okay with me, 1760, 1778
And its also true I do spend a lot of time on the details of policy like the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal, 1778, 1808
But thats because its not a detail for you, 1808, 1817
Its a big deal, 1817, 1821
And it should be a big deal to your president." "So heres what I ask any voter who is still undecided: Give us both a fair hearing, 1821, 1848
Hold us accountable for our ideas both of us, 1848, 1857
I cant promise youll agree with me all the time but I can promise you this: No one will work harder to make your life better, 1857, 1883
I will never stop no matter how tough it gets, 1883, 1893
In fact you can read about what Tim and I want to do, 1893, 1906
Were not keeping it a secret, 1906, 1912
Weve got a book called Stronger Together." But let me tell you a little bit about the values that drive me and my vision for the future because you deserve that from anyone from anyone running for president, 1912, 1950
I want to share with you the stories of three women who at pivotal moments changed my life and set me on a course of social justice activism and public service, 1950, 1981
"The first woman is my mother, 1981, 1987
Her name was Dorothy and she was abandoned by her parents as a young girl, 1987, 2002
She ended up out on her own at 14 working as a housemaid, 2002, 2015
When I learned about this many years later I asked how she managed to grow up into a warm loving person and not become bitter and broken, 2015, 2042
And heres what she said one word: kindness, 2042, 2050
She was saved by the kindness of others, 2050, 2058
Like the teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share, 2058, 2076
The lesson she passed on to me was simple but powerful: No one gets through life alone, 2076, 2093
We have to look out for each other and lift each other up, 2093, 2106
She made sure I learned the words of one of the creeds of our Methodist faith: Do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can." "That mission guides me still today, 2106, 2152
When I stumble it helps pick me up because theres always more good to do and more people to help if we keep our eyes open especially kids." When I met a terrified little girl in Nevada who burst into tears because she worried her parents would be deported it hit me right in the gut, 2152, 2208
I knew how hard-working her parents were, 2208, 2215
I knew the sacrifices they were making so that she could have a better life, 2215, 2230
When I met a little boy in Flint Michigan who got sick from drinking water poisoned with lead it just made me so angry and determined to work even harder, 2230, 2260
Every one of our children deserves the chance to share in the promise of America, 2260, 2275
"The second woman I want to tell you about is Marian Wright Edelman, 2275, 2288
She was a lawyer for the NAACP in Mississippi first African American woman to pass the Mississippi bar, 2288, 2306
She was an ally of Dr, 2306, 2312
King and Robert Kennedy and the founder of the Childrens Defense Fund an altogether remarkable person, 2312, 2328
One day during my first semester in law school I saw a flyer – we used to have those flyers on a campus bulletin board, 2328, 2353
And Marian was coming to give a lecture, 2353, 2361
I made sure to be there and what I heard was captivating, 2361, 2373
Marian talked about creating a Head Start program in Mississippi and using her legal education to make life better for poor children and families, 2373, 2397
Something just clicked in my brain, 2397, 2403
I began to see how I could translate the commitment to helping others Id learned from my mother my church into real social change, 2403, 2427
I went up to her and I said Could I work for you this summer? She said Sure but I cant pay you, 2427, 2450
I said Well I am paying my way through law school so I have to get paid, 2450, 2467
She said Well if you can figure out how to get paid you can have a job, 2467, 2484
So I figured out how to get a grant to get paid and went to work for her." "After graduation I could have followed my classmates to a high-powered law firm but I went to work for Marian at the Childrens Defense Fund instead, 2484, 2528
She sent me door to door in New Bedford Massachusetts on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school back then, 2528, 2555
And I remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house, 2555, 2573
She told me how badly she wanted an education but it just didnt seem possible, 2573, 2588
My heart went out to her and I wanted to help, 2588, 2599
But it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough, 2599, 2611
That wouldnt force the public school to build more wheelchair ramps or put more resources into special education, 2611, 2629
I learned that to drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws, 2629, 2644
So we gathered evidence, 2644, 2648
We built a coalition, 2648, 2652
And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities, 2652, 2668
And that experience turned me into a lifelong advocate for children and families." "I went to South Carolina to investigate the plight of 12- and 13-year-old boys imprisoned alongside grown men who had committed serious felonies, 2668, 2704
In Alabama I helped expose the racism of segregated academies, 2704, 2714
In Arkansas I ran a legal aid clinic that provided representation to poor families and prison inmates who could not afford it, 2714, 2736
When Bill was elected President a lot of people were surprised and even threatened by the idea of an activist as First Lady, 2736, 2759
But I wasnt about to quit then either, 2759, 2767
I fought for universal health care and ended up working with Republicans and Democrats in Congress to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program which covers eight million kids today." "The third woman who changed my life was named Sophia the 17-year-old captain of a high school basketball team in New York City, 2767, 2819
It was the late 1990s and Democrats in New York were urging me to run for the Senate and I kept telling them no, 2819, 2843
After all no First Lady had ever done anything like that, 2843, 2854
I myself hadnt run for anything since student council, 2854, 2863
Id always been an advocate not a politician, 2863, 2871
But then one day I visited that school in New York for an event with young women athletes with Billie Jean King, 2871, 2893
Hanging above our heads was a big banner that said Dare to compete, 2893, 2906
Before my speech Sophia introduced me, 2906, 2912
She was tall and as we shook hands she bent over and whispered in my ear Dare to compete Mrs, 2912, 2932
Clinton, 2932, 2933
Dare to compete, 2933, 2936
Once again something just clicked, 2936, 2941
For years I had been telling young women to step up, 2941, 2952
Participate, 2952, 2953
Go for what you believe in, 2953, 2959
Could it be I was afraid to do something I had urge so many others to do?" "Well it was a difficult transition becoming a candidate for the first time back in that New York Senate race, 2959, 2996
Even all these years later I confess I dont enjoy doing some of the things that come naturally to most politicians like talking about myself, 2996, 3021
But I took that leap then for the same reason Im running now to even the odds for those whove got the odds stacked against them especially children and families, 3021, 3051
And Ive learned that in a democracy if you want to help the greatest number of people you have to push for reform from both the outside in and the inside out, 3051, 3083
We need activists and advocates entrepreneurs and innovators teachers and mentors people who change lives every day in a million quiet ways, 3083, 3105
We also need strong principled leaders who can win votes write laws allocate resources and do the slow hard business of governing." "Now of course politics can be discouraging, 3105, 3134
This election in particularly can be down-right depressing sometimes, 3134, 3143
But it matters, 3143, 3146
It really does, 3146, 3149
It matters for our families our communities and our country and the world, 3149, 3162
Our most cherished values are at stake, 3162, 3169
Every election is important from school board to state senate to president, 3169, 3181
But this time is different, 3181, 3186
We are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his businesses who retweets white supremacists who led the birther movement to delegitimize our first black President and hes still lying about it today, 3186, 3223
He refuses to apologize to President Obama his family and the American people, 3223, 3236
We have to stand up to this hate, 3236, 3244
We cannot let it go on." "And when we do that we send a clear message: America is better than this, 3244, 3265
America is better than Donald Trump, 3265, 3271
Just as important we have a chance to make real progress together in our country, 3271, 3286
I need you, 3286, 3289
I need you as partners not just for winning this election but for driving real change over the next four years, 3289, 3310
The fights ahead of us are bigger than one election one president or even one generation, 3310, 3326
Its going to take all of us working side-by-side to build the kind of future we want, 3326, 3343
Thats why if Im in the White House young people will always have a seat at any table where any decision is being made." "So if you believe diversity is Americas strength not Americas burden join us, 3343, 3380
If you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full-time should have to raise their children in poverty join us, 3380, 3406
If you believe that climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs join us, 3406, 3431
If you believe that every man woman and child in America has the right to affordable quality health care join us, 3431, 3452
If you believe we should finally guarantee equal pay for women join us." "And heres how you can join us, 3452, 3472

It really does, 3509, 3512
Text join j-o-i-n to 47246 right now or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer, 3512, 3528
I understand here at Temple youre already organizing campaign tailgates at every football game and having a lot of fun doing it, 3528, 3550
We have 50 days 50 days to reach everybody we possibly can to not only win an election – thats just the first step – then to keep the progress going go even further make it absolutely clear that were going to shape a future that represents the best of who we are, 3550, 3603
So talk to your classmates, 3603, 3608
Talk to your neighbors, 3608, 3612
Help us stand up for our best values and reject prejudice and paranoia." "You know I mentioned my mother and the kindness she experienced, 3612, 3636
Her life was so neglected that when she went to work as that housekeeper/babysitter at the age of 14 it was the first time she ever saw a family that loved each other where the parents loved their children cared for them planned for them where she learned the lessons that enabled her to be such an extraordinary mother to me and my brothers, 3636, 3700
Everything Ive learned in my life convinces me that love trumps hate." So please join us in working together, 3700, 3719
Theres no doubt in my mind that young people have more at stake in this election than any other age group, 3719, 3740
And when you turn out and vote this fall we will be sending a message much larger than even the outcome, 3740, 3761
We will say we can build a future where all our children have the opportunity to live up to their God-given potential no matter who they are where theyre from what they look like or who they love, 3761, 3799
Thats the America we believe in, 3799, 3805
Thats the America worth fighting for, 3805, 3811
Thats what weve got to do to stand together, 3811, 3820
We are stronger together and lets make sure love trumps hate, 3820, 3831
Thank you all!" , 3831, 3834
