Great honor, 3, 5
Great honor thank you, 5, 9
This is a wonderful day, 9, 14
Aww, 14, 15
 " Wow.xa0 On a Saturday morning yet, 15, 22
Isnt that nice? Thank you all, 22, 28
And were going to have an incredible convention, 28, 36
Its really going well, 36, 40
Were going to have an incredible convention, 40, 47
And were going to get things solved and were going to do lots of wonderful things for our country most importantly." "So Im here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign and the White House to fix our rigged system -- we are in a rigged rigged system -- and to make America safe again and to make America great again." "I want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France, 47, 125
Weve witnessed horror beyond belief no matter where you look, 125, 135
And now its happening more and more, 135, 142
And its never going to stop." "We need new leadership, 142, 152
We need new thinking, 152, 156
We need strength, 156, 159
We need in our country law and order, 159, 167
And if Im elected president that will happen, 167, 175
"  I want to express our unyielding support for the people of France and we mourn their loss as a nation, 175, 196
"And as far as Turkey is concerned so many friends in Turkey great people amazing people, 196, 212
We wish them well, 212, 216
It looks like theyre resolving the difficulty but we wish them well, 216, 228
A lot of -- a lot of anguish last night but hopefully itll all work out." "Now as hopefully the next president of the United States I want to refer back to whats happened over the years, 228, 265
The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before, 265, 275
Never been like this, 275, 279
Out of control, 279, 282
After four years of Clinton who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path because I dont even think he could have made these decisions so badly she led him right down a horrible path, 282, 320
He didnt know what he was doing." "Iraq Syria all into chaos, 320, 332
And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons, 332, 341
And on top of that we gave them back $150 billion and we didnt get our hostages until the end, 341, 361
Now were seeing unrest in Turkey a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton, 361, 375
You just have to look every single thing they touched has turned to horrible horrible death-defying problems." "We also need to bring back in this country -- because we see what happened -- our industry our manufacturing our jobs, 375, 414
Theyve been taken away like were babies, 414, 421
Taken away, 421, 423
And were going to bring them back." "I found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous -- really prosperous society for all Americans, 423, 452
Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice, 452, 460
Ive admired the work hes done especially in the state of Indiana, 460, 472
And Im going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute." "But I also admire the fact that he fights for the people and hes going to fight for you, 472, 505
He is a solid solid person, 505, 511
"  "Governor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress, 511, 520
He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference, 520, 535
Number one, 535, 537
Hes really got the skills of a highly talented executive leading the state of Indiana to jobs growth and opportunity in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every states way by the Obama administration, 537, 575
Its horrible out there, 575, 579
High taxes and regulations, 579, 583
And its out of control." "Mike Pence is a man of honor character and honesty, 583, 598
We know that, 598, 601
Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption, 601, 608
Shes a corrupt person, 608, 612
What shes done with her e-mails what shes done with so many things and I see the ads up all the time the ads, 612, 636
Shes totally bought and paid for by Wall Street the special interests the lobbyists 100 percent, 636, 652
Shes crooked Hillary, 652, 655
"  "And I think that while she got away with murder in fact I think it might be her greatest accomplishment escaping the recent scandal and her lies and the loss of 33000 e-mails -- but it wasnt a loss she discarded -- that in itself is a major crime, 655, 705
Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what theyve done which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton." "Thirty-three thousand e-mails are missing and thats OK? Didnt give them to the FBI? Didnt give them to the attorney general and thats OK? Wipes her server clean thats OK? These are crimes, 705, 759
These are crimes, 759, 762
And how she got away with it I think I understand it but I think a lot of people dont." "But I do believe while she didnt pay the price she should have paid shes going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around, 762, 807
Shes going to pay it at the polls, 807, 815
I believe that, 815, 818
"  "On top of everything else Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time, 818, 839
Shes totally owned by Wall Street, 839, 845
We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism, 845, 853
And its not that she believes in it, 853, 861
The people that give her all of this money believe in it, 861, 873
And shell believe in whatever they want her to believe, 873, 883
Believe me, 883, 885
Thats it, 885, 887
"  What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence, 887, 898
  Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam, 898, 913
Radical Islamic terrorism, 913, 916
You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window, 916, 929
You heard what he was screaming out the window, 929, 938
You saw it in San Bernardino, 938, 944
You saw it at the World Trade Center, 944, 952
You saw it in Orlando, 952, 957
How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris, 957, 966
You see it all over, 966, 971
"And Hillary is a weak person, 971, 977
We are the law and order candidates and were the law and order party, 977, 991
Were going to change things around, 991, 997
Theres going to be respect again for law and order, 997, 1007
"  "Hillary Clintons foreign policy helped launch ISIS, 1007, 1015
You know shes talking -- I see the ads she puts on, 1015, 1027
If I make one statement which is fine shell take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad because shes got a lot of money because its given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests, 1027, 1066
Got a lot of money." "But I see the ads on foreign policy, 1066, 1079
Shes talking about Donald Trump doesnt have foreign policy experience, 1079, 1089
Of course not, 1089, 1092
Ive been a very very very successful businessperson, 1092, 1100
I mean -- but -- but if you look at my calls I said dont go into Iraq, 1100, 1118
Nobody cared because I was a businessperson, 1118, 1125
I was a civilian, 1125, 1129
Take the oil, 1129, 1132
Many many calls Ive made." "You take a look, 1132, 1141
I said that in Scotland and in the U.K, 1141, 1150
that was going to happen, 1150, 1155
I was the one that predicted it, 1155, 1162
And everybody said hes wrong hes wrong, 1162, 1169
President Obama said if it happens theyre going to get to the back of the line which probably is one of the reasons they lost because I consider it a win, 1169, 1200
I think it was a win for them actually because they dont want to be told what to do, 1200, 1219
And they dont want to be told that when people pour into the country they have to take them even if theyre not qualified even if they dont have paperwork even if they have no idea where they come from." "And I said that Brexits going to happen, 1219, 1267
I said that they are going to break away, 1267, 1276
And everybody laughed at me, 1276, 1281
And the odds were 20 percent, 1281, 1287
And then when it happened she took an ad saying oh Donald Trump said this or that but Im the one that said it was going to happen, 1287, 1315
And some of the more fair reporters -- about 30 percent of them -- said he was right, 1315, 1333
I appreciate that, 1333, 1336
Seventy percent didnt so thats OK." "So Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy, 1336, 1356
So important, 1356, 1358
Now I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike -- and one of the reasons is party unity I have to be honest, 1358, 1388
So many people have said party unity, 1388, 1395
Because Im an outsider, 1395, 1399
I want to be an outsider, 1399, 1405
I think its one of the reasons I won in landslides, 1405, 1416
I won in landslides, 1416, 1420
This wasnt close, 1420, 1423
This wasnt close, 1423, 1426
"  "No this wasnt close, 1426, 1431
This was -- in the history of the Republican Party history with 17 people running you have to understand other people ran against one two and three, 1431, 1458
There were 17, 1458, 1461
We got -- I say we because Im the messenger Im a messenger -- Im doing a good job but Im a messenger -- we got almost 14 million votes, 1461, 1491
Thats more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president." "Think of it, 1491, 1514
Thats more than Ronald Reagan who we love, 1514, 1522
Thats more than Richard Nixon, 1522, 1527
Its more than Dwight D, 1527, 1532
Eisenhower, 1532, 1533
You know he won the Second World War in all fairness, 1533, 1544
Pretty good, 1544, 1546
Its more than the Bushes." "But I mean by a lot, 1546, 1557
I dont mean by a little, 1557, 1563
But thats with 17 people, 1563, 1568
People dont over-say that, 1568, 1572
That means our message is unbelievable, 1572, 1578
And I want to thank all of the loyal people -- because I have such loyal unbelievable people and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland where its going to be so amazing." "But they displayed it, 1578, 1615
It was on display where we had this group of people who -- many of whom Ive known and I wont say because for party unity Ill say theyre wonderful people OK? Never Trump they said never Trump never Trump, 1615, 1655
Oh were going to win, 1655, 1660
They got crushed, 1660, 1663
And they got crushed immediately because people want what were saying to happen." "Theyre tired of a country that has horrible trade deals that has no borders that has taxes that are through the roof highest taxed nation just about in the world that has regulations that dont allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start -- and by the way speaking of destroying businesses were going to take care of the miners and were going to take care of the steelworkers, 1663, 1751
Were going to put em back to work, 1751, 1759
"  "So theyre very tired of it, 1759, 1766
But I want to thank all of those people that – delegates-- that were on the different committees because boy was that something, 1766, 1789
Did we show them something, 1789, 1794
And unfortunately the vote was very late, 1794, 1801
But essentially we had 112-12, 1801, 1806
This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and were going to have a big fight, 1806, 1827
Were not going to have a fight, 1827, 1834
People agree with what weve -- they want the wall, 1834, 1844
They want the borders, 1844, 1848
They want these things to happen." "And what were doing.., 1848, 1858
"  "And what were doing that Im so proud of so proud -- and nobody else would even think about doing it -- I fought very hard for it, 1858, 1887
Well call it the Johnson amendment where he took away from the evangelicals -- and I want to thank the evangelicals because without the evangelicals I could not have won this nomination, 1887, 1919
The evangelicals have been unbelievable, 1919, 1924
I dominated with the evangelicals, 1924, 1929
A lot of people were surprised, 1929, 1935
They say hes not perfect, 1935, 1940
But you know what? They know Im going to get the job done and theyre really smart, 1940, 1957
"  "And I said -- and I said for the evangelicals that were going to do something that nobodys even tried to do, 1957, 1980
You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group, 1980, 1992
And he was a powerful president, 1992, 1998
He knew how to get things done, 1998, 2005
He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him, 2005, 2020
But he was a powerful president." "And we call it the Johnson amendment where you are just absolutely shunned if youre evangelical if you want to talk religion you lose your tax-exempt status, 2020, 2053
We put into the platform were going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment, 2053, 2068
And were going to let evangelicals were going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk." "I saw this, 2068, 2094
I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office the top -- the absolute top evangelical leaders Christian leaders Jewish leaders believe it or not some Muslim leaders -- people are going to be surprised to hear that -- I had the top leaders up to my office and I said why is it that youre so powerful as an individual and yet when you get out there youre sort of timid?" "And they didnt know how to answer the question, 2094, 2179
And it took two three meetings before I figured it out, 2179, 2190
One great great gentleman that everybody knows but whose name I will not reveal said Mr, 2190, 2206
Trump we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues, 2206, 2217
We live in fear that were going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything thats even slightly political." "And I looked out the window, 2217, 2243
I was in Trump Tower and I pointed to people walking down the street, 2243, 2257
I said well they have the right to speak but you dont, 2257, 2269
That means theyre more powerful than you are, 2269, 2277
We have to do something about it, 2277, 2284
How did it start? How did it start? "  "And they said it started because of Lyndon Johnson, 2284, 2302
And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader, 2302, 2315
And he did this and he got it done, 2315, 2324
And were going to undo it so that religious leaders in this country and those unbelievable people--and not because they backed me in such large numbers-- but so that religion can again have a voice because religions voice has been taken away, 2324, 2366
And were going to change that, 2366, 2372
OK? All right, 2372, 2375
"  "Back to Mike Pence, 2375, 2380
So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana and I won Indiana big, 2380, 2399
Remember Indiana was going to be the firewall, 2399, 2407
Thats where Trump was going down -- they agreed Id win New York Id win Pennsylvania Id win all these places, 2407, 2428
But Indiana was going to be the firewall." "So I got to study Indiana and I got to study New York and a lot of other places and I saw how NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton has drained our manufacturing jobs just drained us like weve never been drained before, 2428, 2478
NAFTA again signed by Bill Clinton, 2478, 2484
NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country, 2484, 2496
Manufacturing down in some states 55 60 percent, 2496, 2504
Its a horror show moving to Mexico moving to other places." "I have a friend whos a great builder, 2504, 2523
What he builds is plants, 2523, 2528
Thats all he does is build plants, 2528, 2535
He doesnt build buildings, 2535, 2539
He doesnt -- he builds plants, 2539, 2545
Its the biggest in the world from what I hear." "I said hows business? I was with him the other day, 2545, 2566
Hows business? He goes unbelievable, 2566, 2571
I said really wow Im surprised, 2571, 2577
Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country, 2577, 2591
He says Donald what were doing in Mexico you wont believe, 2591, 2602
I said what do you mean? He said were building plants in Mexico the likes of which weve never seen." "I said what about this country? Not much, 2602, 2630
Not much, 2630, 2632
Thats the expression, 2632, 2635
He said exactly that, 2635, 2639
Not much, 2639, 2641
I said but Mexico? He said youve never seen anything like it, 2641, 2653
Its incredible." "Folks thats going to stop, 2653, 2660
Were going to go reverse it, 2660, 2666
Were going to bring our jobs back to this country, 2666, 2676
We cant be the stupid people anymore, 2676, 2683
OK? "  "And he was better than a pollster, 2683, 2692
Hes better than a consultant, 2692, 2697
I would say how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars, 2697, 2716
Doesnt cost me millions, 2716, 2720
Me I give them $10000 OK? "  "It costs other people millions, 2720, 2732
It costs other campaigns millions to get a report, 2732, 2741
Every time they get a report its millions, 2741, 2749
But Ill tell you what a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report, 2749, 2769
And he said it, 2769, 2773
He didnt say it from the standpoint of hes upset about it, 2773, 2785
Just fact, 2785, 2787
How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico, 2787, 2794
In fact he actually said Ive never ever seen anything like it." "And if you look Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan, 2794, 2819
We want them to build them in Michigan, 2819, 2827
Theyre going to build them in Michigan, 2827, 2834
And you know that I know how to do that, 2834, 2844
So easy, 2844, 2846
So easy." "But theyre not going to do and theyre not going to take advantage of us without retribution, 2846, 2865
There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think youre going to youre your product and sell it in here, 2865, 2893
There are consequences, 2893, 2896
And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country, 2896, 2907
Its very simple, 2907, 2910
And everybody here knows what the consequences are but I wont say that because Im much more interested right now in Mike, 2910, 2932
"  "Indianas unemployment rate -- and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike other than he looks very good other than hes got an incredible family incredible wife and family -- Karen is amazing, 2932, 2967
"  "Incredible family, 2967, 2970
Highly respected, 2970, 2972
Expected to go for another four years, 2972, 2979
He would have won I think very easily in Indiana, 2979, 2989
Indiana their unemployment rate has fallen, 2989, 2995
When he was there when he started 8.4 percent when he was governor when he took over to less than 5 percent in May of 2016, 2995, 3021
Since January 2013 Indianas labor force has increased by more than 186000 jobs, 3021, 3034
You have to understand Ive gone around to all these states, 3034, 3045
Ive gone to all of them, 3045, 3051
And every time I have statisticians, 3051, 3057
I say give me the stats on a state." "And its always bad down down down, 3057, 3073
Down 40 percent 50 percent 60 percent in some cases, 3073, 3083
Heres somebody where its gone up, 3083, 3089
Private sector job growth is up by more than 147000 jobs since 2013, 3089, 3102
Thats like very unusual." "Governor Pence balanced the budget, 3102, 3111
Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budgets so out of whack in this country we dont know what were doing, 3111, 3132
Were going to owe very soon $21 trillion, 3132, 3140
He balanced the budget, 3140, 3144
They dont know what that means, 3144, 3150
Governor Pence balanced the budget produced a surplus and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana." "Its also rated triple-A their bonds are rated triple-A, 3150, 3179
Very few states have that, 3179, 3184
Triple-A, 3184, 3185
The best, 3185, 3187
Thats as good as you can get whether youre a company a state triple-A." "Indiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business, 3187, 3218
Number one, 3218, 3220
And its not even close, 3220, 3225
There are approximately 34000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office, 3225, 3243
So you have fewer Hoosiers fewer people from Indiana." "And besides that Bobby Knight my friend who really did help me, 3243, 3264
I mean if you want a reference Bobby Knight in Indiana we love Bobby Knight, 3264, 3279
But he agrees with everything Im saying, 3279, 3286
He loves the governor." "Indiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation for veterans where nobodys fighting for the veterans like Im fighting for the veterans the veterans have been left behind, 3286, 3319
"  "If you remember a few months ago Hillary Clinton said the really -- theyre doing much better the V.A, 3319, 3339
is much better, 3339, 3342
Theyre doing a much better job than people give it credit for, 3342, 3354
People are dying on line waiting for five six days for doctors, 3354, 3366
People are dying on -- they cant even see a doctor, 3366, 3377
Its a scandal." "Take a look at whats happening with the V.A, 3377, 3389
in Arizona, 3389, 3391
Take a look at whats happening with -- you know just the Veterans Administration hospitals, 3391, 3406
Its a scandal, 3406, 3409
Its corrupt, 3409, 3411
Its incompetent, 3411, 3413
Its a scandal, 3413, 3416
And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine, 3416, 3424
And boy am I going to win big with the veterans, 3424, 3435
I mean we know that for a fact, 3435, 3443
"  "So its now 2.4 percent for veterans, 3443, 3451
In 2013 when Mike Pence took office the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent, 3451, 3465
It was 31st in the nation one of the bad ones and now its almost the best, 3465, 3482
Got em jobs, 3482, 3485
Got em jobs." "Indianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates, 3485, 3501
Thats a great thing, 3501, 3505
Theyre going to stay there, 3505, 3510
Thats a great thing, 3510, 3514
And Mike worked hard on that, 3514, 3520
He was telling me that was not easy." "Under Governor Pences leadership Indiana enacted the largest K-12 education funding increase in the states history, 3520, 3544
So youre balancing budgets and yet youre giving more money to education, 3544, 3556
Isnt that a great thing? "  "Indiana has just about the largest school choice program in America, 3556, 3573
School choice is where its at folks, 3573, 3580
You want to get your schools better you gotta get rid of Common Core fast." "Governor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the states history, 3580, 3607
Think of that, 3607, 3610
Were cutting taxes and balancing budgets, 3610, 3616
And along with corporate tax reform just about number one in the country, 3616, 3629
CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure." "So with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets were spending more money on education and the infrastructure is kept up, 3629, 3663
That had so much -- look as a builder nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump, 3663, 3689
I build infrastructure, 3689, 3692
Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?" "You know its very interesting, 3692, 3712
Were building -- were building -- I won -- the -- which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue right near the White House and its an amazing -- probably the best location one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA General Services, 3712, 3775
And I really like whats happened, 3775, 3781
Were going to have an opening very soon, 3781, 3789
Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it." "But I thought the other day I was going over the numbers were under budget and about a year -- actually more than a year – but were a year ahead of schedule and were under budget substantially, 3789, 3838
And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do, 3838, 3854
"  "And when I explained to a government representative that were under budget and ahead of schedule they almost fell off because theyve never heard those words before, 3854, 3882
Theyve never heard them." "So when I see what happened to Indiana which was having tremendous problems when I see what happened to Indiana under Mikes work -- also his predecessor did a great job by the way great job whos now at Duke -- whos now at Purdue -- when I see what happened with respect to the numbers the state and everything else that to me was probably the single most important point because its something that hasnt happened -- almost has not happened in this whole country." "The turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible and I learned that when I campaigned there, 3882, 3990
And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide, 3990, 4002
And I learned that when Governor Pence under tremendous pressure from establishment people endorsed somebody else but it was more of an endorsement for me if you remember, 4002, 4030
He talked about Trump then he talked about Ted -- whos a good guy by the way whos going to be speaking at the convention Ted Cruz good guy -- but he talked about Trump Ted then he went back to Trump, 4030, 4072
I said who did he endorse?" "So even though he was under pressure because Im so you know outside of the establishment it was the single greatest non-endorsement Ive ever had in my life OK? I will tell you, 4072, 4111
"  So with that I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States Governor Mike Pence, 4111, 4146
Thank you, 4146, 4148
Thank you everybody, 4148, 4151
Thank you, 4151, 4153
