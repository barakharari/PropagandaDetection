Thank you, 0, 2
It is great to be here in the city of Henderson in the beautiful state of Nevada – a state where I have so many great friends and employees, 2, 31
In 34 days we are going to win this state we are going to win the White House, 31, 49
How many of you watched the Vice Presidential Debate last night? Mike did such an incredible job, 49, 66
I would argue that Mike had the single most decisive victory in the history of Vice Presidential debates, 66, 84
Last night America also got a firsthand look at my judgement and the judgement of my opponent, 84, 101
Our first Presidential decision was the selection of our running mates and all of America saw that I made the right choice, 101, 123
While Mike laid out big and bold solutions for America his opponent talked only of small and petty distractions, 123, 142
"Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and hasnt fixed anything, 142, 154
In fact shes just made things worse – she failed upstate New York promising to create 200000 jobs but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent, 154, 179
She failed overseas producing only death and destruction – she unleashed ISIS destabilized Iraq Syria and Libya and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons." At home Hillary Clinton failed Latinos and African-Americans producing only more poverty in the inner cities, 179, 221
She is merely the vessel for the global special interests bleeding this country dry, 221, 235
I am running to represent Americans – and we are going to make America Rich again, 235, 251
I am going to end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees keep jobs from pouring out of our country renegotiate our disastrous trade deals and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses, 251, 290
My economic agenda is very simple: jobs jobs jobs, 290, 299
The problems we face as a country are immense and it is going to take bold action to turn things around, 299, 320
Right now we owe $20 trillion in debt, 320, 328
It doubled under President Obama, 328, 333
Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country, 333, 342
The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years, 342, 355
Our police are under-funded under-staffed and under-supported – and Hillary Clinton basically accuses our police of all being racist, 355, 374
Our border is wide open and drugs and criminal cartels are pouring into the country, 374, 389
Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare – even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need, 389, 425
Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year, 425, 438
The federal budget is a disaster, 438, 444
Our State Department mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds, 444, 462
We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 462, 472
We are a nation divided with race riots in the streets, 472, 483
"Our college students graduate loaded with debt only to discover they cant find jobs – or certainly not the jobs they want." "Our allies arent paying their fair share foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities cant provide the most basic services." America needs a turnaround, 483, 550
America needs a comeback, 550, 554
America needs a change, 554, 558
That is why I am running, 558, 564
On November 8th we are going to show the whole world that America is back – bigger and better and stronger than ever before, 564, 588
First we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 588, 597
President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, 597, 610
That was a lie, 610, 614
He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2500 dollars, 614, 624
Instead they surged $5000, 624, 628
Another lie, 628, 630
Now of all people President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare, 630, 646
Two days ago Bill Clinton torched President Obamas signature legislation, 646, 656
Remember Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama of the Democratic Party and of our country." Bill has a different view, 656, 682
Here is what bill said: He just said its a "crazy system" and that "its the craziest thing in the world." Bill said: "people out there are busting it sometimes 60 hours a week and wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesnt make any sense" and that "the insurance model doesnt work." On my first day in office I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare, 682, 797
There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump, 797, 809
The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th, 809, 820
The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th, 820, 832
And early voting begins on the 22nd, 832, 839
Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival China Japan and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country our businesses and our citizens, 839, 881
"Were not on a level playing field and our politicians dont understand what is going on." Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers and we are not making things in America anymore, 881, 914
Too much is being made in other countries, 914, 922
When I am President we will start making things in America again, 922, 934
"Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clintons NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton, 934, 954
Hillarys Korea deal also cost us another 100000 jobs." Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70000 factories have shut down or left the United States, 954, 987
"Thats 15 factories closing a day on average." We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 987, 1009
As the factories leave our money leaves with them, 1009, 1018
Stores close schools suffer the tax base erodes wages fall and the quality of life declines, 1018, 1034
Real cash wages for many workers today are lower than they were in 1973, 1034, 1048
"Weve rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own, 1048, 1058
Skyscrapers go up in Beijing while plants and factories crumble in the United States." Companies like Carrier General Electric Motorola Mattel Fiat Chrysler and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico and to other countries, 1058, 1095
"And now Ford has announced its moving all of its small car production to Mexico also." "We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we dont get the deal we want we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers." We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation and apply tariffs to countries that cheat, 1095, 1161
We will also stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership the deal Hillary called the "Gold Standard." The backers of the deal have donated heavily to Hillary Clinton and their wish is her command, 1161, 1192
She is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors, 1192, 1204
I am an outsider fighting for YOU, 1204, 1211
We will stop the foreign cheating the product dumping and the one-sided trade deals, 1211, 1225
We will lower taxes on American business from 35% to 15% and many small businesses will file as individuals any pay only 12 percent, 1225, 1249
On top of that we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history, 1249, 1263
Our tax trade energy and regulatory reforms will help us reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs in a decade, 1263, 1287
America will become the great jobs magnet of the world, 1287, 1297
Factories will come rushing in our schools and communities will be revitalized and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope, 1297, 1323
But to be a rich nation we must also be a secure nation, 1323, 1336
Security begins at the border, 1336, 1341
Any government that does not protect its own people is a government unworthy and unfit to lead, 1341, 1358
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this President Obama and Hillary Clinton, 1358, 1384
This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root, 1384, 1392
The man who killed her arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released into a U.S, 1392, 1411
community under the immigration policies of Obama-Clinton, 1411, 1418
He was released again after the crime and is now at large, 1418, 1430
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0 top of her class the day before, 1430, 1445
Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa Arizona, 1445, 1467
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody, 1467, 1488
Another victim is Kate Steinle gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times, 1488, 1510
"Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 1510, 1533
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administrations priorities for removal." In California a 64-years old Air Force Veteran Marilyn Pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer, 1533, 1571
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported, 1571, 1583
Also in California my good friend Jamiel Shaw lost his amazing son at the age of 17 – he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant, 1583, 1611
The killer had 3 gun charges as well as battery of a police officer prior to the shooting but he had not been deported from our country, 1611, 1638
There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with criminal convictions in the country right now and more who have escaped the law entirely – when I am President we are getting them out and we are getting them out quickly, 1638, 1679
"All Americans living lawfully in this country including millions of patriotic hardworking immigrants are entitled to have their jobs their wages and their security protected, 1679, 1704
The borders around our nation are for the benefit of all people living here today – and when those borders are erased its often the lawful immigrants already here who are the first to suffer lost jobs and decreased security." At the same time our country is being infiltrated by terrorists, 1704, 1755
Just two days ago an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot, 1755, 1769
Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, 1769, 1786
"The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington State, 1786, 1822
Now the media doesnt want to talk about this – they dont want to ask how our vetting procedures failed or how immigration from high-risk parts of the world increased the chances of terrorism and violence." The Boston Bombers were here on asylum, 1822, 1865
The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia, 1865, 1878
The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, 1878, 1890
I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country, 1890, 1901
Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees, 1901, 1910
Hillary is for open borders, 1910, 1915
I am not running to be President of the world, 1915, 1925
I am running to be President of the United States, 1925, 1935
I am for America First, 1935, 1940
For the first time in American history we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers, 1940, 1960
We are going to build a border wall enforce our laws and keep our people safe, 1960, 1976
I have a simple message for the cartels the gang members and the drug dealers preying on our citizens – your days are numbered and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end, 1976, 2012
We are also going to end the government corruption Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking, 2012, 2035
Then she bleached and destroyed 33000 emails – after a congressional subpoena, 2035, 2047
She lied to Congress under oath and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals, 2047, 2064
"Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clintons top aides to DESTROY their laptops." Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to mail in your ballots, 2064, 2105
We are also going to fix our inner cities and help Latino Americans 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty, 2105, 2130
"58% of African-American youth dont have jobs." More than 3000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, 2130, 2152
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 2152, 2160
and more than 60% in Baltimore, 2160, 2166
"The Democrats like Hillary Clinton have run the inner cities for 50 years sixty years seventy years or more, 2166, 2185
Theyve produced only more joblessness failing schools and rising crime." To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump, 2185, 2214
I will fix it, 2214, 2218
I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty and to help their children grow up in safety and peace, 2218, 2243
Poor communities will see a massive infusion of new small businesses and new high-paying jobs, 2243, 2258
I am also going to fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation, 2258, 2278
I want to put every American child on the ladder of success: a great education and a high-paying job, 2278, 2297
Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 2297, 2381
This Election Day you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this country, 2381, 2402
On November 8th the arrogance of Washington D.C, 2402, 2410
will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 2410, 2423
The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of by and for the people, 2423, 2442
I am going to fight for every last citizen in this land and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 2442, 2467
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 2467, 2488
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 2488, 2502
Youre going to remember this day, 2502, 2508
This is a movement like youve never seen before, 2508, 2517
Were going to make history together." "Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote Ive ever cast for anyone at any time." A vote for me is a vote for change and a vote for me is really a vote for you, 2517, 2569
You are voting to believe in yourselves, 2569, 2576
You are voting to believe in your country, 2576, 2584
All together we are going to – Make America wealthy again, 2584, 2595
We are going to make America strong again, 2595, 2603
We are going to make America safe again, 2603, 2611
And we are going to make America great again, 2611, 2620
