The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election, 0, 21
This election will determine whether we remain a free country or we become a corrupt Banana Republic controlled by large donors and foreign governments, 21, 45
The election of Hillary Clinton would lead to the destruction of our country, 45, 58
Today we learned the Department of Justice fed information to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes, 58, 87
This is collusion and corruption of the highest order and is one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor, 87, 113
We have to investigate the investigation, 113, 119
Hillary bleached and deleted 33000 emails after a congressional subpoena – and then destroyed her phones with a hammer – all to cover-up her crimes, 119, 144
People have gone to jail for doing far less, 144, 153
She also lost as much as $6 billion taxpayer dollars, 153, 163
"These Wikileaks emails confirm what those of us here today have known all along: Hillary Clinton is the vessel for a corrupt global establishment that is raiding our country and surrendering our sovereignty, 163, 196
This criminal government cartel doesnt recognize borders but believes in global governance unlimited immigration and rule by corporations." .., 196, 215
Even Chelsea Clinton the WikiLeaks emails show expressed "serious concerns" about conflicts of interests at the Clinton Foundation and State Department, 215, 236
During a recent trip to Florida I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti, 236, 257
The Haitian community has contributed so much to this country, 257, 267
I also learned from them firsthand how much they despise the Clintons for what they did to the people of Haiti, 267, 288
New emails revealed today by ABC News show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti which killed over 150000 people the Clintons couldnt stop cashing in, 288, 314
As people were dying in Haiti Clinton insiders were separating out requests from "Friends of Bill" or "William Jefferson Clinton VIPs" so that their business interests or contracts would receive special treatment, 314, 346
People who were labeled "Not Friends of Bill" were placed on the sidelines, 346, 359
"In their biggest project the Clintons used $400 million in aid and U.S, 359, 372
taxpayer funds to build what amounted to a sweatshop, 372, 381
And guess who set it up? Cheryl Mills Hillarys Chief of Staff who helped destroy her emails and then got an immunity deal from the FBI that included the destruction of her computer." "The company that benefitted from Mills actions then invested in a company owned by Cheryl Mills." "Today as Haitis death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti last time." To all of our friends in Haiti your day of justice is coming and it arrives on November 8th, 381, 474
"Not only have the Clintons ripped off Haiti but the new emails show members of the Clinton team attacking Catholics, 474, 494
This is deeply offensive, 494, 498
Its just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton Campaign has for everyday Americans, 498, 514
Weve all read the reports and heard the stories about how disrespectfully she treats law enforcement secret service and others in uniform, 514, 536
She even smeared all of Americas police officers as essentially racist." "Im proud of the fact that I have always treated the working people of this country with dignity and respect especially our military and law enforcement personnel." "The WikiLeaks emails show that Hillarys staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile." "The emails also show yet again that the DNC rigged the Democratic election to give it to Hillary Clinton, 536, 613
The DNC Vice Chair was caught feeding information about Bernie Sanders plans to the Clinton Campaign." "To all the Bernie voters out there: dont vote for a Wall Street sellout like Hillary Clinton, 613, 646
A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions more Wall Street cheating more terrible trade deals and – as confirmed by Wikileaks – she also wants to cut Medicare and Social Security." .., 646, 683
"Wikileaks also shows something I have been warning about for a very long time, 683, 697
The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign, 697, 707
Its just one more way the system is rigged." Reporters who work for these outlets – like the Washington Post or the New York Times – may think of themselves as journalists but they are actually just cogs in a corporate political machine, 707, 750
"The emails show the New York Times Boston Globe Univision and Jon Harwood of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons and smother the Clintons with praise, 750, 777
The NYT even gave Clinton veto power of her quotes in their stories, 777, 790
Its called corruption." The emails also show that the Hillary was given the CNN townhall questions before her big debate against Bernie Sanders, 790, 813
Dona Brazile the DNC Vice Chair emailed: "from time to time I get the questions in advance." "The media cant report on the establishment because the media is the establishment, 813, 843
And theyre all teamed up against you the American people." .., 843, 854
On November 8th the arrogance of Washington D.C, 854, 862
will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 862, 875
We are going to replace our corrupt global establishment that has failed us on borders on trade on foreign policy on the economy and so much more, 875, 902
We are going to replace the failed leadership in Washington who have betrayed you squandered our wealth and sold our country, 902, 923
I am asking all Americans – Republicans Independents and Democrats – to join us in our campaign to give our government back to the American people, 923, 949
I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 949, 980
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 980, 1001
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 1001, 1015
Youre going to remember this day, 1015, 1021
This is a movement like youve never seen before, 1021, 1030
Were going to make history together, 1030, 1036
Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote Ive ever cast for anyone at any time." A vote for me is a vote for change and a vote for me is really a vote for you, 1036, 1082
Once again we are going to have a government of by and for the people, 1082, 1097
We will make America wealthy again, 1097, 1103
We will make America strong again, 1103, 1109
We will make America safe again, 1109, 1115
And we are going to make America great again, 1115, 1124
