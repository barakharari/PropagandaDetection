"If Mr, 0, 2
Trump gets his way it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin." "Tuesdays terrorist attacks in Brussels were a horrifying reminder that the fight against ISIS and radical jihadist terrorism is far from over, 2, 36
Keeping us safe at home and defeating ISIS and global terrorism abroad are going to be some of the biggest challenges facing our next Commander-in-Chief, 36, 61
And thats why we need to elect a president whos prepared to do all parts of the job from day one." "Hillary Clinton responded to the Brussels attack explaining her plan to defeat ISIS and the global terrorist movement and sharing her vision for the role that America and our allies must play in the fight against terrorism around the world, 61, 122
Heres what you need to know (and you can read her full remarks " ), 122, 137
In the past year alone terrorists have attacked transportation hubs in Brussels a nightclub and restaurants in Paris a office holiday party in San Bernardino a hotel in West Africa a beach resort in Tunisia a market in Lebanon a Russian passenger jet in the Sinai—and too many other places, 137, 187
The threat of terrorism in the 21st century is real urgent and borderless, 187, 200
As Hillary said "Walls wont protect us from this threat, 200, 210
We cant contain ISIS—we must defeat ISIS." Today ISIS controls a sizable (yet shrinking) territory in Iraq and Syria—but it also leads a wider network that reaches across the Middle East and North Africa and into Europe Asia and North America and includes other terrorist groups, 210, 256
To win the war against global terrorism Hillary argued that we have to do battle on each of these fronts, 256, 276
And she   to do that: "Hillarys plan calls for taking out ISISs stronghold in Iraq and Syria by intensifying the current air campaign stepping up support for local forces on the ground and pursuing a diplomatic strategy to resolve Syrias civil war and Iraqs sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias—both of which have contributed to the rise of ISIS." "But we also have to dismantle the global terror network that supplies money arms propaganda and fighters, 276, 352
That doesnt just mean going after enablers who help jihadist terrorists with things like travel and document forgery—it also means denying them "  territory by discrediting their ideology online and stopping their digital recruitment strategies, 352, 387
And hardening our defenses and building our resilience at home will help us discover and disrupt plots before theyre carried out, 387, 408
That requires an intelligence surge including partnering with Silicon Valley to track and analyze ISISs social media posts and map jihadist networks online, 408, 431
As Hillary said "The tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to protect our safety and our privacy." Americas alliances make us stronger, 431, 464
Hillary argued that turning our back on our European allies who are on the front lines of the war on terror would be dangerous and foolish and it would send the wrong signal to our friends and our foes, 464, 503
"Putin already hopes to divide Europe" Hilary said, 503, 511
"If Mr, 511, 513
Trump gets his way it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin, 513, 525
It will make America less safe and the world more dangerous." "What Republicans like Trump dont understand is that we need Europe, 525, 547
We need European intelligence and diplomacy European banks fighting terrorist financing European aircraft flying missions in the Middle East and European special forces helping train and equip local forces fighting ISIS." In fact we need Europe to do  "—and thats why Hillary called on our European partners to take more steps to stop the flow of foreign fighters to and from the Middle East, 547, 611
Knowing the identities of every fighter with a European passport who makes the trip revoking passports and visas and sharing information in real time is essential in this fight, 611, 640
So is a commitment by countries like Belgium to identify and invest in the neighborhoods prisons and schools where terrorist recruitment happens." Take it from our nations former chief diplomat: Bluster doesnt work—we cant just "carpet bomb" populated areas "into oblivion" as Ted Cruz has suggested, 640, 686
Bigotry is also an unacceptable response: Hillary pointed out that its just as dangerous to promote offensive inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims—the very people who are most likely to recognize the warning signs of radicalization before its too late and who are in the best position to block it, 686, 736
And torture—a tactic promoted by Donald Trump—puts our troops and civilians at greater risk, 736, 750
Thats why Hillary pledged that if shes elected president she will never condone or practice torture anywhere in the world, 750, 770
So what does work? Smart strong steady leadership from the United States, 770, 782
As Hillary said "No other country can rally allies and partners to defeat ISIS and win the generational struggle against radical jihadist terrorism, 782, 805
Only the United States can mobilize common action on a global scale in defense of our peoples and our values, 805, 825
And thats exactly what we need to do." , 825, 833
