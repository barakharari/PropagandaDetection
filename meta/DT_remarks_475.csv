Thank you, 0, 2
It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey, 2, 25
"Ive come to know and love the people of New Hampshire, 25, 36
You are strong independent and you are free." We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days and we are going to win this state we are going to win the White House, 36, 74
We are going to take on the special interests the lobbyists and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans, 74, 98
We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people trillions in new wealth for our communities and rising wages for every working American, 98, 124
We are going to create a new government that serves you your family and your country, 124, 140
We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service, 140, 156
Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors, 156, 169
I am an outsider fighting for you, 169, 176
Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money, 176, 197
The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 197, 215
Follow the money, 215, 218
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 218, 238
Follow the money, 238, 241
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 241, 258
Follow the money, 258, 261
The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton, 261, 273
Again just follow the money, 273, 278
In her campaign for President Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds, 278, 299
She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office, 299, 314
The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government, 314, 329
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State, 329, 346
Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks, 346, 356
"She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance shed put the Oval Office up for sale too." "She deleted and bleached 33000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, 356, 394
13 phones missing several destroyed with a hammer, 394, 402
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals, 402, 414
Were going to call them the FBI Immunity 5, 414, 423
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server, 423, 432
Lies to Congress under oath about turning over her work-related emails." She and her financial backers will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country, 432, 470
The American people have had it with years decades of Clinton Corruption and scandals, 470, 484
They are tired of the lies they are tired of the trivial politics they are tired of being talked down to looked down upon and treated like second class citizens, 484, 514
The Clintons are the sordid past, 514, 520
We are the bright future, 520, 525
While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions, 525, 549
This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough, 549, 561
Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for African-American communities, 561, 576
I dont think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart and they know they are being used, 576, 601
They also know that shell do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does and that will never change, 601, 624
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators." Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over, 624, 668
A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people, 668, 679
My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 679, 694
We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs, 694, 728
Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated along with every illegal executive order, 728, 742
We will unleash the power of American energy – we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people, 742, 777
Common core will be ended and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice, 777, 795
The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced, 795, 805
And the disastrous trade deals like NAFTA that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire will be renegotiated, 805, 824
"NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton – and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved, 824, 850
Youve lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal." Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and if she gets the chance she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership – which would destroy manufacturing in this state, 850, 904
Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation, 904, 931
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries, 931, 951
I am not running to be President of the World, 951, 961
I am running to be President of the United States of America, 961, 973
"From now on its going to be America First." Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen? Think about it, 973, 1004
For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders fair trade deals and quality schools that serve parents and students? "All the things youve ever wanted for your country have been denied." "The reason for this is simple, 1004, 1076
Its because the financial interests who control our politics and our media dont want these changes to happen." These special interests control Hillary Clinton, 1076, 1100
She is their chosen representative, 1100, 1105
"Shes been there for 30 years and has never done anything for you and your family." "Shes there for only one reason to protect her donors and collect their money." "Our campaign is taking on big business big media and big donors – were taking them on for YOU, 1105, 1154
So you can have the future you want." That includes keeping your family safe, 1154, 1168
"New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in Americas large cities and that its the largest single-year increase in 45 years." More than 3000 people have been shot in Chicago since January, 1168, 1203
"The failed politicians and the arrogant media dont want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country, 1203, 1227
They just want me to go along with the status quo." Well I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us, 1227, 1256
We will never back down from fighting to save American lives, 1256, 1267
"That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism, 1267, 1278
Hillary Clinton cant even say the words." We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs, 1278, 1296
New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border, 1296, 1313
The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled – once again our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people, 1313, 1334
I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border – that is a promise, 1334, 1351
The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton, 1351, 1368
"Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C, 1368, 1380
Were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives." "Theyre all part of the same corrupt political establishment, 1380, 1406
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable." I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country, 1406, 1434
Together we can accomplish anything we want, 1434, 1441
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th, 1441, 1454
You have to knock on doors, 1454, 1460
You have to pick up that phone, 1460, 1467
You have to campaign on the streets, 1467, 1474
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country, 1474, 1489
To beat the system you have to lift your voice pound the pavement and get out the vote, 1489, 1507
Visit our website to find out how you can help, 1507, 1517
You have 40 days until the election, 1517, 1524
You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true, 1524, 1540
Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away, 1540, 1547
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation, 1547, 1565
The arrogance of Washington D.C, 1565, 1570
will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 1570, 1584
On November 8th we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before, 1584, 1608
Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country: We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1608, 1685
We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1685, 1697
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1697, 1717
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1717, 1726
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation, 1726, 1744
American workers will be hired to do the job, 1744, 1753
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 1753, 1765
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1765, 1787
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1787, 1808
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 1808, 1830
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 1830, 1843
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1843, 1849
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1849, 1855
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1855, 1861
And We Will Make America Great Again, 1861, 1868
Thank you and God Bless! , 1868, 1873
