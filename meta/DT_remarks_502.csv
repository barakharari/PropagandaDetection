Thank you, 0, 2
In 24 days we are going to win the state of Maine and we are going to win the White House, 2, 23
Make sure to get your absentee ballots, 23, 30
Together we are going to deliver real change that puts America First, 30, 42
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 42, 57
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes and regulations lift the restrictions on American energy end common core and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare, 57, 100
We are also going to replace a failed political class that has betrayed our workers spent trillions on endless foreign wars without victory and destroyed our middle class, 100, 128
"Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration, 128, 137
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration, 137, 146
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration, 146, 156
Your energy bills will go way down under a Trump Administration, 156, 167
Your companies wont be leaving Maine under a Trump Administration." We are going to be a rich country again, 167, 186
We are also going to end government corruption, 186, 194
"Hillary speaks in secret to Goldman Sachs – her private position – then lies to you the public with her public position, 194, 216
Its all a fraud." Hillary Clinton deleted 33000 emails – after a Congressional Subpoena – she lied to Congress under oath she made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer and now we learn 2 boxes of email evidence mysteriously went missing, 216, 258
"Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted and gone to jail for her crimes, 258, 271
The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes – and I guarantee you the Clintons are laughing at them, 271, 303
The Directors performance in Congress coupled with Bill Clintons clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney Generals airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary – supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren – is perhaps the lowest point in those departments history." Instead of being held accountable Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election, 303, 362
The election is being rigged by corrupt media pushing false allegations and outright lies in an effort to elect her President, 362, 383
But we are going to stop it, 383, 390
We are not going to back down, 390, 397
We are not going to let it happen, 397, 405
We have only just begun to fight, 405, 412
Americans have had it with the years the decades of Clinton Corruption, 412, 424
This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough, 424, 437
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." Hillary and Bill raise millions of dollars from global interest groups who have no allegiance to this country or its workers, 437, 478
By "open trade" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars, 478, 497
By "open borders" she means totally unlimited immigration, 497, 505
Either we win the election or we lose the country, 505, 515
"Hillarys plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism within our shores, 515, 533
She wants us to follow the path of France and Germany and import terrorism directly into the United States." "So let me state this as clearly as I can, 533, 562
If Im elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country." We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration, 562, 587
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders, 587, 596
And yes we will build a wall, 596, 603
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, 603, 615
It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl, 615, 640
In August Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times including one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home, 640, 672
He left her on the side of a dirt road, 672, 682
What kind of government allows its own people to suffer such horrors? "As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldnt take them back, 682, 716
Among those she allowed to go free was a criminal alien who had previously been convicted for shooting a girl in the head – after his release he viciously murdered a young girl name Casey Chadwick." A wall will not only keep out criminals but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth, 716, 773
Drugs overdoses in Maine are on a record pace, 773, 782
I have outlined a plan to stop the opioid crisis, 782, 792
My plan begins with a strong border includes the prosecution of drug dealers and dramatically expands access to life-saving treatments that will help people unchain themselves from this terrible addiction, 792, 822
But if we are going to bring hope back to suffering Americans we must also solve our jobs crisis, 822, 841
At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals, 841, 855
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps, 855, 869
We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 869, 892
This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton, 892, 898
When I am President everything will change, 898, 905
We will move people from the welfare rolls to the employment rolls, 905, 917
We will end our chronic trade deficits, 917, 924
We will start growing again, 924, 929
"Well rebuild our roads schools bridges tunnels railways hospitals and airports." The state of Maine has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton, 929, 963
Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70000 factories have shut down or left the United States, 963, 987
"Thats 15 factories closing a day on average." We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 987, 1009
"If I win day one we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA, 1009, 1024
If we dont get the deal we want well leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal." We are going to start making things in America again, 1024, 1054
As part of our plan to bring back our jobs we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent, 1054, 1078
We will lower taxes massively on all Americans – Hillary will raise your taxes massively, 1078, 1093
Our biggest reductions will be for the working and middle class – this includes letting parents deduct the cost of childcare, 1093, 1114
"Reagans tax cuts in the eighties and Kennedys tax cuts in the sixties brought us tremendous growth, 1114, 1131
My economic reforms – on taxes trade regulation and American energy – will produce at least 25 million newjobs in a decade, 1131, 1153
Its the most pro-growth economic plan in American history." We are also going to protect the right of the people of Maine to use their own land, 1153, 1180
President Obama with the support of politicians like Hillary Clinton issued an executive order 2 months ago making over 87000 acres in Maine into a new "National Monument." No consideration was made for local concerns impacts to jobs or the Maine forestry sector, 1180, 1223
No approval by Congress, 1223, 1227
Your state legislature opposed it, 1227, 1232
It is just another federal overreach that is going to do more harm than good, 1232, 1247
Obama and Clinton dont care that this area badly needs jobs and growth and that this decision -- done at the stroke of the pen without the support of the local community-- undermines the people that live and work here in Maine, 1247, 1289
"But we are going to turn it all around, 1289, 1298
Americas comeback begins on November 8th." Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1298, 1399
You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true, 1399, 1416
On November 8th the arrogance of Washington D.C, 1416, 1424
will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 1424, 1437
I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation, 1437, 1454
"Im going to fight for every child living in poverty, 1454, 1464
Im going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence." "Im going to fight for every worker who deserves a raise and for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries." "Im going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors." "Im going to fight for every patriotic citizen that Hillary Clinton slanders as deplorable and irredeemable – and I am going to be a President for all of our citizens." I am going to fight to bring us together as Americans, 1464, 1573
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1573, 1594
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 1594, 1608
Youre going to remember this day, 1608, 1614
This is a movement like youve never seen before, 1614, 1623
Were going to make history together, 1623, 1629
Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote youve ever cast for anyone at any time." Once again we are going to have a government of by and for the people, 1629, 1670
We will make America wealthy again, 1670, 1676
We will make America powerful again, 1676, 1682
We will make America strong again, 1682, 1688
We will make America safe again, 1688, 1694
And we will make America great again, 1694, 1701
