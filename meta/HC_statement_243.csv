Hillary Clinton released the following statement on the ongoing labor negotiations between Verizon and their communications workers thousands of whom are based in New York: "I am disappointed to learn that negotiations have broken down between Verizon and their workers represented by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, 0, 54
xa0Verizon should come back to the bargaining table with a fair offer for their workers, 54, 69
xa0To preserve and grow Americas middle class we need to protect good wages and benefits including retirement security, 69, 87
xa0And we should be doing all we can to keep good-paying jobs with real job security in New York, 87, 106
"Instead Verizon wants to outsource more and more jobs, 106, 115
xa0That would mean walking away from workers who have been part of their family and our communities for years â€“ the workers who install and repair our phone and cable service and who respond to customer needs day and night, 115, 155
xa0We rely on these men and women as part of the communications infrastructure that keeps businesses and our economy moving, 155, 175
xa0Verizon should do the right thing and return to negotiations, 175, 185
"I believe in the power of collective bargaining, 185, 193
xa0If elected President I will do everything in my power to protect workers protect unions and give businesses the incentives and support to keep jobs here, 193, 219
I will also fight for an America where workers do not have to go on strike to have health care secure jobs and pensions." , 219, 243
