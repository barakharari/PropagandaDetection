We need Hillary, 0, 3
When I announced that I would lead the effort to change the culture around mental health to address stigma and the way our city delivers mental health services—a tough issue that has historically been ignored—Hillary was one of the first to express enthusiasm and to offer me advice about how to make sure everyone is included in  ", 3, 61
I wasnt surprised." "Thats probably why from the very beginning Hillary recognized a truth that many would rather ignore: So many of the challenges facing American families are rooted in inequality, 61, 92
That is why throughout her career she has fought for policies that address the root causes of inequality." "The need for her leadership on this issue has never been more urgent especially for African Americans, 92, 127
The typical African American family has just 8 cents of wealth for every dollar held by a typical white family, 127, 147
Eight cents, 147, 149
And its even less for African American women." That has to change—and it starts by fighting for equal pay, 149, 168
That is why Hillary as senator helped pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, 168, 180
But equal pay is just a start, 180, 187
We also need to give hardworking Americans a raise, 187, 196
"Back in January my husband Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $15-dollar minimum wage for all city government employees, 196, 215
And on Monday our states minimum wage was raised to $15 dollars, 215, 227
Now we need other states to follow our lead." It is also high time for us to provide every American with access to paid sick leave and paid family leave, 227, 257
Because no one should be forced to choose between the health of their family and their next paycheck, 257, 275
"Doing that wont be easy, 275, 280
I know because weve already done it extending paid family leave to 20000 city employees and sick leave to a half-million more New Yorkers." Now we need to make sure every family has access to these crucial resources, 280, 318
Doing that will take more than a vision, 318, 326
It will take a plan and meticulous follow up and execution, 326, 337
"And lets not forget early childhood education—a passion that Hillary and I have long shared, 337, 352
Universal pre-k is in its second year here in New York City and I know that Hillary is eager to extend universal pre-kindergarten to the rest of the country." In New York City we have a bold vision to address inequality, 352, 393
And we have plans to make that vision a reality, 393, 403
Our city and our country would benefit greatly if we had a progressive president in the White House, 403, 421
That is why we need Hillary, 421, 427
No one is better prepared to help us with our mission, 427, 438
No one is better prepared to help our working families, 438, 448
"She has what it takes—and she wont stop until the work is done." , 448, 461
