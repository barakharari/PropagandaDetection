Vote like your reproductive rights depend on it, 0, 8
"Republicans in Congress just voted again to defund Planned Parenthood—and if we had a Republican president right now millions of Americans would lose access to basic health care, 8, 36
So in 2016 this country faces a choice: Let Republicans take their assault on reproductive health and rights all the way to the White House or fight back.The reality is Republican presidential candidates dont just have bad records—theyre tripping over themselves to brag about who will do more damage to womens health if they get elected, 36, 92
We have to make sure they dont get the chance.Here are a few of the reasons why a Republican president would be very very bad news for women:" "Its not just Republicans in Congress, 92, 126
Every single Republican presidential candidate has vowed to defund Planned Parenthood which would cut off millions of patients access to life-saving preventive care including cancer screenings well-woman exams STI and HIV tests and more." "Todays vote proves that its never been more critical to have a president who stands with Planned Parenthood, 126, 178
You wont find that person in the Republican field." "Last year alone Republicans in Congress voted numerous times to chip away at womens reproductive rights, 178, 203
And Republican presidential candidates are on the same mission: Every single one of them supports efforts to restrict womens access to safe and legal abortion and some even oppose abortion in cases of rape incest or to protect a womans health." "In other words: If Congress sends a bill restricting womens reproductive rights to a Republican president you can bet he or she will sign it—and with as many as four Supreme Court seats opening up within the next presidents term in office the right to safe and legal abortion itself could hang in the balance." All of the Republican presidential candidates have pledged to repeal the Affordable Care Act—which makes birth control and preventive care available at no out-of-pocket cost, 203, 324
"To make matters worse many of the Republican candidates for president applauded the Supreme Courts recent Hobby Lobby decision which lets bosses impose their personal beliefs on their employees birth control options, 324, 356
Instead of protecting and expanding access to birth control the way President Obama has done a Republican president would put it back out of reach for millions of women." Republican candidates have made it crystal clear: Each one of them if elected will waste no time in tearing up the Affordable Care Act kicking 18 million Americans off their health care plans and ripping away all the progress weve made, 356, 426
That means taking us back to the days when insurers could charge women more than men for the exact same health coverage, 426, 448
It means going back to insurers denying women coverage because of "pre-existing conditions" like breast cancer pregnancy or domestic violence (seriously), 448, 469
And it means forcing women to go back to paying hundreds of dollars a year for basic health care like cancer screenings and birth control, 469, 494
