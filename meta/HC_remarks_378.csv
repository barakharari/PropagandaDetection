"Thank you, 0, 2
Thank you all, 2, 5
Hello everyone, 5, 7
Its great to be here at UNC Greensboro, 7, 15
I want to thank Martha for that wonderful introduction, 15, 24
It means so much to have her here along with her wonderful daughter Sara and her mother Barbara, 24, 42
And the story she told is really one that motivates me every day because it is kids like Sara that led me to politics in the first place to try to make our country and our world better for them, 42, 82
So to see Sara grown up and thriving is very special and your whole familys support really means the world to me, 82, 104
Thank you Martha Sara Barbara "I have to say its great to be back on the campaign trail, 104, 122
As you may know I recently had a cough that turned out to be pneumonia, 122, 137
I tried to power through it but even I had to admit that maybe a few days of rest would do me good, 137, 160
And Im not great at taking it easy even under ordinary circumstances, 160, 172
But with just two months to go until Election Day? Sitting at home was pretty much the last place I wanted to be." "But it turns out having a few days to myself was actually a gift, 172, 209
I talked with some old friends, 209, 215
I spent time with our very sweet dogs, 215, 223
I did some thinking, 223, 227
The campaign trail doesnt really encourage reflection and its important to sit with your thoughts every now and then, 227, 246
And that did help me reconnect with what this whole campaign is about." "People like me – were lucky, 246, 265
When Im under the weather – now I just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs, 265, 289
But I want you to think with me for a minute about how I certainly feel lucky, 289, 306
When Im under the weather I can afford to take a few days off, 306, 320
Millions of Americans cant, 320, 324
They either go to work sick or they lose a paycheck dont they?" "Lots of Americans still dont even have insurance or they do but its too expensive for them to actually use, 324, 357
So they toss back some Tylenols they chug orange juice and they hope that the cough or the virus goes away on its own." "Lots of working parents cant afford childcare which in many states costs as much as college tuition, 357, 398
So for millions of moms and dads if they get sick theres no backup, 398, 412
Theyre on their own arent they?" "Thats the story for too many people still in America, 412, 428
When illness strikes or an accident happens you feel youre on your own, 428, 441
If you lose your job or cant afford college youre on your own, 441, 454
If your aging parent starts needing more help and you dont know what to do youre on your own." "Life events like these are catastrophic for some families but mere bumps in the road for others, 454, 490
I have met so many people living on a razors edge one illness away from losing their job one paycheck away from losing their home, 490, 515
And that goes against everything we stand for as Americans, 515, 525
Because some things should not come down to luck, 525, 534
Some things should be within reach for everyone no matter what, 534, 545
Like financial security, 545, 548
Like affordable health care, 548, 552
Like the peace of mind that comes with knowing that if something goes wrong your family will be okay, 552, 571
And above all the knowledge that no matter what your president is fighting for you and will always have your back." "That right there thats why I got into this race, 571, 602
I am running for everyone working hard to support their families everyone whos been knocked down but gets back up, 602, 622
The factory workers on their feet all day and the nurses looking after patients all night, 622, 638
Im running for young people like so many of you here who dream of changing our world for the better and for all the parents and grandparents supporting those dreams by dedicating every dollar they can spare to your education." "Im running for the LGBT teenager here in North Carolina who sees your governor sign a bill legalizing discrimination and suddenly feels like a second-class citizen, 638, 704
And if anyone wonders what the costs of discrimination are just ask the people and businesses of North Carolina, 704, 723
Look at whats happening with the NCAA and the ACC, 723, 733
This is where bigotry leads and we cant afford it – not here not anywhere else in America." "Im running for women like Janelle Turner, 733, 758
Back in May of last year Janelle was diagnosed with breast cancer, 758, 770
She went through nearly six months of very tough treatments, 770, 780
Last October she brought her eight-year-old daughter to one of our rallies in Iowa and they made a huge sign that read Thirteenth chemo yesterday, 780, 805
Three more, 805, 807
Hear me roar! Wouldnt you want to meet the woman behind that sign? Well I sure did, 807, 824
So we got talking and weve stayed in touch, 824, 833
She keeps promising me shell see me at the inauguration, 833, 843
And I tell her Ill keep working to get there but shed better be there too." "Im running for her and all the mothers and fathers trying to get and stay healthy so they can be there for their kids, 843, 883
But perhaps most of all Im running for those kids, 883, 893
Standing up for children has been the work of my life, 893, 904
As a lawyer with the Childrens Defense Fund as First Lady in Arkansas in the White House as a Senator I have fought for kids housed in adult jails kids who have been neglected and abused kids who couldnt get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions kids with disabilities so they could go to school, 904, 959
You heard today from someone Ive known for a long time now grown up and a lovely young woman Anastasia Somoza, 959, 980
I learned from my family and my Methodist faith that we are each called to do all the good we can for all the people we can for however long we can, 980, 1012
And to me that means making sure all our children have the chance to live up to their God-given potentials." "So when I meet a little girl in Nevada terrified that her parents are going to be deported it hits me right in the gut, 1012, 1057
When I meet a little boy in Flint Michigan who cant drink the water at home or in school because its poisoned with lead that gets me going, 1057, 1085
All I want to do is get to work making things better for them." "Thats why I care so much about national security too, 1085, 1109
I want to give our kids a safer world, 1109, 1118
To me that means a world with strong allies more friends fewer enemies and fewer nuclear weapons, 1118, 1135
It also means leading the fight against climate change so we can leave our kids a health planet." "My opponent in this race disagrees with me on every one of these fronts, 1135, 1167
Just a few days ago he said that if another countrys troops taunted ours – not fired at them but taunted them just taunts – hed responded – he would respond by blowing them out of the water, 1167, 1205
He would start a war over that, 1205, 1212
That is just one more reason my friends why the stakes in this election are as high as any in our lifetimes." "Ive been involved in politics in one way or another for many years, 1212, 1247
It is not an easy business, 1247, 1253
It can get rough and Ive built up some defenses, 1253, 1263
When it comes to public service Im better at the service part than the public part, 1263, 1279
But this is why I do it and this is who Im in it for: to make life better for children and families, 1279, 1302
And thats what this race has always been about for me." "Well now were in the final stretch, 1302, 1320
There are just 54 days till Election Day, 1320, 1328
Just 54 days till the most consequential vote of our lifetimes, 1328, 1339
And just a little more than a month until early voting starts here in North Carolina, 1339, 1355
Lets make these days count particularly here because you know what your governor and legislature tried to do – make it harder for young people to vote harder for people of color harder for people with disabilities harder for the elderly, 1355, 1396
There cant be any more motivation than that to make sure every young person every person of color every person with a disability every older person turns out and votes." "So in these final days lets try to tune out all the chatter and the nonstop analysis that doesnt often have much to do with what the next president has to do to create good jobs to create opportunity to make it possible for every young person to afford to go to college or get the skills that you need for the jobs of the future, 1396, 1492
Lets talk about what really matters." "And heres my promise to you, 1492, 1504
Im going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way I will serve as your president should you give me that great honor – focused on opportunities for kids and fairness for families." "Next week Ill go to Philadelphia to talk about challenges facing our young people; in Florida to focus on building an economy that welcomes everyones contributions in-cluding people with disabilities; then Ill be back here in North Carolina to meet with more working families, 1504, 1586
From now until November 8th everywhere I go Im going to talk about my ideas for our country, 1586, 1604
My campaign has rolled out detailed plans in 38 different policy areas – yes somebody actually counted, 1604, 1621
Everything from reining in Wall Street to creating good-paying jobs to fighting Alzheimers to supporting people with autism, 1621, 1639
You see I have this old-fashioned notion that if youre running for president you should say what you plan to do how youre going to get it done and how youre going to pay for it, 1639, 1675
You can read it all on my website hillaryclinton.com, 1675, 1684
We even put it in a new book called you guessed it Stronger Together, 1684, 1698
Get a copy of it because it tells you everything Tim Kaine and I intend to do." "Now like a lot of women I have a tendency to over-prepare, 1698, 1727
I sweat the details whether were talking about the exact level of lead in the water in Flint or how many North Carolina kids are in early enrichment programs or the precise interest rate on your student loans right down to the decimal, 1727, 1770
Because you know what? Its not a detail if its your kid, 1770, 1782
Its not a detail if its your family, 1782, 1790
Its a big deal, 1790, 1794
And it should be a big deal to your president." "Now I confess Ill never be the showman my opponent is and thats okay with me, 1794, 1820
Just look at – look at the show he put on with Dr, 1820, 1833
Oz today, 1833, 1835
But I am going to deliver for you and your family just like I did for Sarah all those years ago with the Childrens Health Insurance Program that gave her the chance to be the extraordinary young woman she is, 1835, 1875
And Ill tell you something else, 1875, 1881
People accuse me of all kinds of things, 1881, 1889
You probably have seen that, 1889, 1894
But nobody ever accuses me of quitting, 1894, 1901
And I will never give up Ill never walk away no matter how tough the going gets, 1901, 1918
Im actually asking Americans to hold me accountable for my ideas and hold my opponent accountable for his." "We dont need a president who says the minimum wage is too high, 1918, 1949
We need a president who knows that Americans deserve a raise to get to a living wage, 1949, 1966
We dont need a president who wants to take away peoples health coverage, 1966, 1979
We need a president who wants everyone to have quality affordable health care, 1979, 1992
And we dont need a president who apparently thinks only married people deserve paid leave and only mothers stay home with kids, 1992, 2014
We dont need someone who rushes out a half-baked plan just weeks before an election after decades of ignoring or putting down working moms, 2014, 2038
We need a president who has spent years fighting for these issues who has a plan to support all families in all their various shapes, 2038, 2063
Ask yourself which candidate you can count on to be on your side respect your family stand up and fight for you and your kids." "That is who you should vote for on November 8th because as Michelle Obama said in her fabulous speech at the Democratic convention when we go to the polls this November the real choice isnt between Democrat or Republican, 2063, 2127
Its about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives, 2127, 2146
Its also about the kind of country we want to be and what we want to leave behind for future generations, 2146, 2167
People have to decide are we going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top? Are we going to bring people together or pit Americans against each other and rip our country apart? Are we going to work with our allies to keep us safe or are we going to put a loose cannon in charge who would risk everything generations of Americans have worked so hard to build?" "Now I have a lot of confidence in the American people and in our country, 2167, 2256
My opponent keeps running us down saying were weak a disaster an embarrassment, 2256, 2269
Every time he says things like that I think about Janelle and her strength in the face of cancer or Martha and Sarah in the face of their health challenges and that little boy in Flint who gets up every day and goes to school even though he cant drink the water, 2269, 2321
See my opponent has America all wrong, 2321, 2328
Theres nothing we cant do when we come together as one nation set big goals and pursue them." "And the American dream – the American dream is big enough for everyone to share in its promise, 2328, 2364
So if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage that no one who works full-time should have to raise their child in poverty join us, 2364, 2392
If you believe that every man woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care and women should be free to make our own health decisions join us, 2392, 2423
If you believe – if you believe your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay then join us, 2423, 2443
Get involved these last 55 days, 2443, 2449
Go to hillaryclinton.com or text join j-o-i-n to 47246, 2449, 2458
We need volunteers right here in North Carolina, 2458, 2466
We cant do this without you." "And remember the presidential race isnt the only one this fall, 2466, 2483
Weve got a lot of im-portant statewide races, 2483, 2491
Lets come together and send Deborah Ross to represent the people in the Senate, 2491, 2505
Starting on October 20th you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county, 2505, 2528
So the heat is on, 2528, 2533
Spread the word, 2533, 2536
Tell your friends your family your neighbors, 2536, 2543
If you share our vision for Americas future come be part of helping us shape it, 2543, 2559
We do not have a minute to lose." We have so many blessings, 2559, 2572
Now its our job to deliver on those and to make sure every single person and particularly every child no matter who they are what they look like or who they love is part of the American dream now and way into the future, 2572, 2616
Let that be our message, 2616, 2621
Let that be our mission, 2621, 2626
Please come out and help us fight fight for you fight for our children fight for our families, 2626, 2644
Lets make America all that it should be, 2644, 2652
Thank you and God bless you!" , 2652, 2658
