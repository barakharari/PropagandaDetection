"Whoever America elects this fall will help determine the future of the Court for decades to come." "This afternoon in Madison Wisconsin Hillary Clinton laid out the stakes of one of the most important issues of the 2016 election: the Supreme Court, 0, 42
Heres what you need to know." At its best the Supreme Court is a place where the rights of every American are heard and protected, 42, 67
And that notion left a powerful impression on Hillary growing up, 67, 78
In recent years the Court has made a lot of consequential decisions—some that uphold those ideals and some that undermine them, 78, 99
The Court?"made same-sex marriage legal nationwide preserved the Affordable Care Act—not once but twice—and ensured equal access to education for women" Hillary said, 99, 122
However it also "cut the heart out of the Voting Rights Act, 122, 134
It overturned commonsense laws addressing gun violence."? "Justice Scalias recent death leaves the Supreme Court at a critical crossroads: His replacement could tip the ideological balance on the bench determining whether the Court protects and advances the progress weve made as a nation—or dismantles Americans fundamental rights one ruling at a time." President Obama has done his constitutional duty to nominate a justice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, 134, 205
But so far Republicans in Congress are refusing to do theirs—denying his nominee Judge Merrick Garland a proper nomination hearing, 205, 225
"Theyd rather undermine the president and stall until after the election—when they think theyll have a shot of reclaiming the White House, 225, 247
Thats not only unprecedented its also undemocratic." "Republicans in Congress claim theyre just waiting for a new president to give the American people a voice, 247, 272
But Hillary called their bluff:" "On Election Day two justice will be older than 80—past the Supreme Courts average retirement age, 272, 293
That means the next president could appoint multiple justices, 293, 302
In doing so he or she will have the power to transform the makeup of the Court for decades to come." Why does that matter? Just look at the cases on the docket in this term alone, 302, 339
As Hillary said: "For years Republicans have been quietly and effectively using the courts to impose their aggressive agenda where legislation has failed, 339, 362
Now theres a very real chance that Donald Trump—someone who believes Muslims should be banned from entering the country who wants to kick out 11 million immigrants and who thinks wages are too high—could be the person appointing Supreme Court justices an attorney general and federal judges at every level." "And we cant forget that Trump is far from alone when it comes to extreme rhetoric and tactics, 362, 430
Republicans led by Ted Cruz shut down the federal government rather than fund the Affordable Care Act in 2013, 430, 449
They nearly shut down the government again last fall over Planned Parenthood, 449, 461
And they did so with the blessing of their leader in the Senate Mitch McConnell who publicly stated that his and his partys No, 461, 485
1 goal was to ensure that President Obama would be a one-term president." As Hillary pointed out: "And we cant afford to let the Republicans make that call." , 485, 513
