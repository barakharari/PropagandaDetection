Thank you, 0, 2
I am so thrilled to be back in Arizona, 2, 11
In 35 days we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House, 11, 30
I am going to make America Rich again, 30, 38
I am going to end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees keep jobs from pouring out of our country renegotiate our disastrous trade deals and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses, 38, 77
My economic agenda is very simple: jobs jobs jobs, 77, 86
I want to send our best wishes to the great governor Mike Pence as he prepares for his debate tonight, 86, 106
The debate will be a contrast between our campaign of big ideas and bold solutions for tomorrow versus the small and petty Clinton campaign that is stuck in the past, 106, 136
We are change – she is four more years of Obama, 136, 147
"Clinton cant talk about the real problems facing our country because shes the one who helped create all of our problems in the first place, 147, 172
To hide her corruption she deleted 33000 emails after a congressional subpoena." "Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and hasnt fixed anything, 172, 196
In fact shes just made things worse – she failed upstate New York promising to create 200000 jobs but manufacturing is down almost 40 percent, 196, 221
She failed overseas unleashing death and destruction, 221, 228
And she failed Latinos and African-Americans producing only more poverty in the inner cities." "Now after years of failure she complains about how Ive used the tax laws to my benefit, 228, 259
Then why didnt she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did? She could have changed those laws when she was in the Senate, 259, 292
The reason that she did not is that her donors and contributors have used those tax laws the same as I did." "I know all their names and I know who they are but its not up to me to make them public figures." Two public Hillary supporters who are known are George Soros who declared losses of $1.5 billion in just six months and Warren Buffet who in 2014 declared losses of $873 million, 292, 367
I know how the tax code works better than anyone and I am going to fix it so it is fair and just and works for you and your family, 367, 397
"Ive made my money as a highly-successful private businessperson following the law, 397, 409
Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official violating the law and selling her government office." The problems we face as a country are immense and it is going to take bold action to turn things around, 409, 448
Right now we owe $20 trillion in debt, 448, 456
It doubled under President Obama, 456, 461
Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country, 461, 470
The homicide rate last year experienced its largest single-year increase in 45 years, 470, 483
Our border is wide open and drugs and criminal cartels our pouring into the country, 483, 498
Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare – even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need, 498, 534
Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year, 534, 547
The federal budget is a disaster, 547, 553
Our State Department mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds, 553, 571
We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 571, 581
We are nation divided with race riots in the streets, 581, 591
"Our college students graduate loaded with debt only to discover they cant find jobs – or certainly not the jobs they want." Overseas our failed leaders have empowered Iran unleashed ISIS and turned Iraq Libya and Syria into absolute chaos, 591, 631
"Our allies arent paying their fair share foreign countries like Russia and China do not respect us and our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities cant provide the most basic services." America needs a turnaround, 631, 676
America needs a comeback, 676, 680
America needs a change, 680, 684
That is why I am running, 684, 690
First we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 690, 699
The architect of Obamacare Jonathan Gruber admitted that the whole sales pitch was a lie – he called it the "stupidity of the American voter." But the only stupidity was the stupidity of our leaders who passed this disaster into law over the objections of the American people, 699, 747
Do you remember all the lies? President Obama said if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, 747, 766
He promised his plan would reduce premiums by $2500 dollars, 766, 776
Instead they surged $5000, 776, 780
Now of all people President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare, 780, 796
He has absolutely trashed President Obamas signature legislation, 796, 804
Remember Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama of the Democratic Party of our country." Bill has a different view, 804, 829
Here is what bill said: He just said its a "crazy system" where people end up with "premiums doubled and coverage cut in half." He said "its the craziest thing in the world." Bill Clinton said: "people out there are busting it sometimes 60 hours a week and wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesnt make any sense" and that "the insurance model doesnt work." "I couldnt agree more, 829, 936
Which is why on my first day in office I am going to ask a Republican Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare." This is essential for Arizona, 936, 969
Because of Obamacare most of the state will only have 1 carrier next year and premiums are expected to go up by 49% next year, 969, 994
There is only 1 way to stop it: to vote for Trump, 994, 1006
Early ballots are mailed out on October 12th and you need to mail them back in as early as you possibly can, 1006, 1028
Next we are going to unleash American energy I just met with energy producers in Colorado and they are pleading with the government to let them create jobs and wealth in the United States, 1028, 1062
As part our plan to reach 4% growth and create at least 25 million new jobs we are going to lift the restrictions on shale oil natural gas clean coal and all forms of job-producing American energy, 1062, 1099
Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival China Japan and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country our businesses and our citizens, 1099, 1141
"Were not on a level playing field and our politicians dont understand what is going on." Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers and we are not making things in America anymore, 1141, 1174
Too much is being made in other countries, 1174, 1182
When I am President we will start making things in America again, 1182, 1194
Companies like Apple will start making their computers and iPhones in our country, 1194, 1207
"Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clintons NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton, 1207, 1227
Hillarys Korea deal also cost us another 100000 jobs." Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70000 factories have shut down or left the United States, 1227, 1260
"Thats 15 factories closing a day on average." Never in history has a country surrendered so much of its wealth to foreign countries, 1260, 1283
As the factories leave our money leaves with them, 1283, 1292
Stores close schools suffer the tax base erodes wages fall and the quality of life declines, 1292, 1308
"Weve rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own." Companies like Carrier General Electric Motorola Mattel Fiat Chrysler and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico and to other countries, 1308, 1341
"And now Ford has announced its moving all of its small car production to Mexico also." "We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we dont get the deal we want we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers." We are also going to stand up to foreign currency manipulation and apply tariffs to countries that cheat, 1341, 1407
Jobs will leave from other countries and come into the United States, 1407, 1419
Factories will come rushing in our schools and communities will be revitalized and our poorest citizens will get new jobs and higher pay –and new hope, 1419, 1445
But to be a rich nation we must also be a secure nation, 1445, 1458
Security begins at the border, 1458, 1463
"A nation that doesnt control is borders is not a nation." "A country that doesnt protect its people isnt a country." "A government that doesnt put its own citizens first is a government unworthy and unfit to lead." Here are some heartbreaking examples of how our government has failed our citizens, 1463, 1514
Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this Administration, 1514, 1536
This includes incredible Americans like 21-year-old Sarah Root, 1536, 1544
The man who killed her arrived at the border entered federal custody and then was released into a U.S, 1544, 1563
community under the policies of this White House, 1563, 1571
He was released again after the crime and is now at large, 1571, 1583
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0 top of her class the day before, 1583, 1598
Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policies was Grant Ronnebeck a 21 year-old convenience store clerk in Mesa Arizona, 1598, 1620
He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from Federal Custody, 1620, 1641
Another victim is Kate Steinle gunned down in the Sanctuary City of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times, 1641, 1663
"Then there is the case of 90 year-old Earl Olander who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home, 1663, 1686
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records who did not meet the Obama Administrations priorities for removal." In California a 64-yeard old Air Force Veteran Marilyn Pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer, 1686, 1724
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never deported, 1724, 1736
Also in California my good friend Jamiel Shaw lost his amazing son at the age of 17 – he was viciously shot and killed by an illegal immigrant with three gun charges as well as battery of a police officer – but despite these previous crimes he had not been deported, 1736, 1787
A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25000 homicide arrests to their names, 1787, 1816
There are more than 2 million criminal aliens in the county right now – when I am President we are getting them out and quickly, 1816, 1841
On top of that illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion a year, 1841, 1856
For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next ten years we could provide one million at-risk students with a school voucher, 1856, 1883
At the same time our country is being infiltrated by terrorists, 1883, 1894
Just yesterday an immigrant from Bangladesh was charged in another ISIS plot, 1894, 1906
Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, 1906, 1923
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington, 1923, 1958
Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers here on asylum or the San Bernardino Shooter here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia, 1958, 1982
Or the Orlando shooter the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, 1982, 1994
I am going to keep the terrorists out of our country, 1994, 2005
Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees, 2005, 2014
Hillary is for open borders, 2014, 2019
I am not running to be President of the world, 2019, 2029
I am running to be President of the United States, 2029, 2039
I am for America First, 2039, 2044
For the first time in American history we have the endorsement of our ICE officers and our Border Patrol officers, 2044, 2064
We also have the endorsement of Sheriff Joe, 2064, 2072
We are going to build a border wall enforce our laws and keep our people safe, 2072, 2088
The chaos the violence and the crime will come to an end – beginning in January of 2017, 2088, 2106
We are going to end the government corruption "Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking, 2106, 2128
Then she bleached and destroyed 33000 emails – after a congressional subpoena, 2128, 2140
She lied to Congress under oath and her staffers took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals, 2140, 2157
Its worse than Watergate." "The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged and its a shame and its one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation." We have become a Banana Republic, 2157, 2193
"Yesterday we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clintons top aides to DESTROY their laptops." Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels and the American people have one chance to stop it – by sending in your ballots, 2193, 2245
We are also going to fix our inner cities 45% of African-American children under the age of six live in poverty, 2245, 2266
"58% of African-American youth dont have jobs." More than 3000 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, 2266, 2287
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 2287, 2295
and more than 60% in Baltimore, 2295, 2301
"The Democrats like Hillary Clinton have run the inner cities for 50 years six years seventy years or more, 2301, 2320
Theyve produced only more joblessness failing schools and rising crime, 2320, 2330
Theyve horribly failed and abused our African-American and Latino communities." To those African-Americans and Latinos suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump, 2330, 2361
I will fix it, 2361, 2365
To everyone in the country I say: what do you have to lose? We will have safe communities for EVERYONE, 2365, 2385
School choice for your children, 2385, 2390
Great trade deals that bring jobs into our country not out of our country, 2390, 2404
Everyone will be included in the American Dream, 2404, 2412
Here are the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest job-creating tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; end common core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 2412, 2496
We are going to rebuild America, 2496, 2502
We are going to revitalize America, 2502, 2508
And we are going to unite America, 2508, 2515
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 2515, 2536
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 2536, 2550
Youre going to remember this day, 2550, 2556
Were going to make history, 2556, 2561
This is a movement like youve never seen before, 2561, 2570
Were going to make history together." "Youre going to look back at this event and youre going to look back at November 8th or the day you put in your early ballot and say this is by far the most important vote Ive ever cast for anyone at any time." You are going to be proud of your country again and you are going to be proud of your President again, 2570, 2641
"A vote for me is a vote for change and a vote for me is really a vote for you, 2641, 2661
You are voting to believe in yourselves, 2661, 2668
A vote for commonsense government solutions to problems, 2668, 2676
Its a vote for jobs jobs jobs." "Its a vote for a government of by and for the people." All together we are going to – Make America wealthy again, 2676, 2706
We are going to make America strong again, 2706, 2714
We are going to make America safe again, 2714, 2722
And we are going to make America great again, 2722, 2731
