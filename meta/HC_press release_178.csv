"My hope is that my daughter will not have to dream of being the first anything." Dear Mrs, 0, 18
Clinton My daughter Alexis is 8 years old, 18, 26
She was born in 2008 to a white mother and African American father the same year we elected a strong president who looks like her.? In this election Alexis is looking forward to another strong president that also looks like her, 26, 67
Alexis is a BIG Hillary Clinton supporter, 67, 74
Although she does not understand all that is at stake during this election  When my husband was growing up his dream was to be the first black president, 74, 102
Although his aspirations went a different direction I saw the pride in him when this became a reality for President Obama, 102, 123
He accomplished the hopes and dreams of MILLIONS of Americans, 123, 133
You have this same opportunity, 133, 138
My hope is that my daughter will not have to dream of being the first anything because that road will have already been paved by strong women like you, 138, 167
 Good luck and keep up the fight for us all!!! â€”Heather Henderson Illinois , 167, 180
