Let me be clearâ€”I am pro-life, 0, 6
I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape incest or the life of the mother being at risk, 6, 25
I did not always hold this position but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me, 25, 50
My story is well documented so I will not retell it here, 50, 62
However what I will do with the remaining space is express my feelings about life and the culture of life as we approach the 43nd anniversary of the Roe v, 62, 92
Wade, 92, 93
I build things, 93, 96
There is a process involved in building things, 96, 104
We tap into a lot of disciplines with engineering being one of the most important, 104, 119
The rules for putting structures together are as strict as are the rules of physics, 119, 134
These rules have stood the test of time and have become the path to putting together structures that endure and are beautiful, 134, 156
America when it is at its best follows a set of rules that have worked since our founding, 156, 174
One of those rules is that we as Americans revere life and have done so since our Founders made it the first and most important of our "unalienable" rights, 174, 203
Over time our culture of life in this country has started sliding toward a culture of death, 203, 220
Perhaps the most significant piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v, 220, 236
Wade was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago over 50 million Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by this country, 236, 262
They never had the chance to become doctors musicians farmers teachers husbands fathers sons or daughters, 262, 278
They never had the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their skills lives loves or passions into the fabric of country, 278, 304
They are missing and they are missed, 304, 311
The Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found, 311, 333
Even if we take the court at its word that abortion is a matter of privacy we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds then should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress, 333, 381
Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best, 381, 404
If using taxpayer money to facilitate our slide to a culture of death was not enough the 1973 decision became a landmark decision demonstrating the utter contempt the court had for federalism and the 10th Amendment, 404, 440
Roe v, 440, 442
Wade gave the court an excuse to dismantle the decisions of state legislatures and the votes of the people, 442, 461
This is a pattern that the court has repeated over and over again since that decision, 461, 477
Perhaps Roe v, 477, 480
Wade became yet another incidence of disconnect between the people and their government, 480, 493
We are in the middle of a presidential political cycle and votes will be cast in just days, 493, 511
The citizens of this nation will have the chance to vote for candidates that are aligned with their individual worldviews, 511, 531
It is my hope that they will choose the builder the man who has the ability to imagine the greatness of this nation, 531, 554
The next President must follow those principles that work best and that reinforce the reverence Americans hold for life, 554, 573
A culture of life is too important to let slip away for convenience or political correctness, 573, 589
It is by preserving our culture of life that we will Make America Great Again, 589, 604
