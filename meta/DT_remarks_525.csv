Thank you, 0, 2
 n Thank you very much, 2, 7
 n We love New Hampshire I can tell you that, 7, 17
 n I need to open with a very critical breaking news announcement, 17, 29
 n "The FBI has just sent a letter to Congress informing them that they have discovered new e-mails pertaining to the former Secretary of State Hillary Clintons investigationn" Audience: Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!n And they are reopening her case into her criminal and illegal conduct that threatens the security of the United States of America, 29, 89
 n "Hillary Clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before, 89, 102
We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office, 102, 115
I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the Department of Justice are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made, 115, 145
" n "This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood, 145, 160
And it is everybodys hope that it is about to be corrected, 160, 172
" n So that is a big announcement that I heard 10 minutes ago and I guess obviously most of you folks have heard about and in all fairness for all of the people that have suffered for doing so much less including just recently four-star General James Cartwright General Petraeus and many others, 172, 226
Perhaps finally justice will be done, 226, 232
 n "With that being said the rest of my speech is going to be so boring, 232, 248
Should I even make the speech? We will talk about borders right? We will talk about trade, 248, 265
Well bring back our jobs well strengthen our military and lets get going OK? " n I want to thank General Flynn hes a great general and I want to thank you for being here General, 265, 301
Thank you very much, 301, 305
Just before General Flynn was going up we heard this news, 305, 316
I said "General get up there and keep them busy, 316, 326
We want to digest what just happened here." Thank you General.n In 11 days we are going to win New Hampshire   the state of my first victory, 326, 353
And we are going to win back the White House, 353, 363
 n Seventy-five percent of the American people think our country is on the wrong track and we are going to fix it, 363, 385
We are going to get our country back on the right track and very very quickly, 385, 401
Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare  n "We cant forget how big a news that is we cant lose track, 401, 424
Its a disaster just like everything else in this administration.n" It has just been announced that Americans are going to experience another massive double-digit hike in Obamacare premiums including a 116 percent premium hike to our very good friends in the great state of Arizona.n Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is the craziest thing in the world where people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half.n In Minnesota where the premium increase will be almost 60 percent the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable, 424, 518
Jonathan Gruber the architect of Obamacare  " admitted it was all a fraud and he said it was passed because of the stupidity of the American voter, 518, 545
Hey were doing a lot of good work arent we? Were catching all of these people, 545, 561
Were doing a good job, 561, 566
Jonathan Gruber theres another, 566, 570
See we didnt forget, 570, 574
I never forgot Jonathan Gruber.n" "I said you know if I do this were going to run and his name came up and people forget after a week or two, 574, 604
I said I am never going to forget Jonathan Gruber the architect of Obamacare and what he said, 604, 622
So we did not forget, 622, 627
Almost can you imagine its like a little more than a week before the election, 627, 642
We didnt forget the name Jonathan Gruber.n" "But the only real stupidity is that shown by our politicians who passed this monstrosity over the furious objection of certain politicians and the American voter, 642, 675
Job-killing Obamacare is just one more way the system is rigged, 675, 686
What Ive just announced previously it might not be as rigged as I thought, 686, 700
Right? Right? " n "The FBI I think theyre going to right the ship folks, 700, 715
I think theyre going to right the ship, 715, 723
" n "And theyre going to save their reputation by doing so.n" Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare destroying American health care forever, 723, 748
She wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive, 748, 759
I will repeal and replace Obamacare and we will replace it with a much less expensive plan and a plan that is much much better, 759, 784
 n "Just this year Hillary Clinton declared Obamacare is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama the Democratic Party and our country, 784, 807
Well that was thats turned out to be wrong, 807, 816
Do they do anything right? We dont win anymore, 816, 825
We dont I mean youre going to have such a good time starting in 17, 825, 840
Were going to start winning again, 840, 846
Were going to start winning again, 846, 852
" n "Because its turned out and Ive been saying this from before it passed Obamacare is a catastrophe beyond imagination, 852, 873
Insurers are leaving doctors are quitting companies are fleeing workers hours are being cut part-time jobs are all over the place, 873, 894
Those beautiful full-time jobs that you used to have dont exist and deductibles are through the roof, 894, 911
You dont get to use it, 911, 917
We dont get rid of Obamacare we have no choice, 917, 927
But if we dont get rid of it our health care system is gone forever, 927, 942
Well never have another chance.n" "And by the way if we dont win this election youre never going to have another chance either that I can tell you, 942, 970
Never going to happen again, 970, 975
Repealing Obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on November 8th, 975, 991
" n "But real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington and again maybe thats happened, 991, 1010
Wow, 1010, 1011
We have a big day, 1011, 1016
" n No think of it I won my first primary in New Hampshire and I am getting here and the news this morning is this is bigger than Watergate, 1016, 1046
This is bigger than Watergate in my opinion, 1046, 1054
This is bigger than Watergate  n "Hillary bleached and deleted 33000 e-mails after receiving a congressional subpoena, 1054, 1071
That alone to me there were more serious things done but how does it get much more? But that was so obvious, 1071, 1093
She gets the subpoena and she bleaches and deletes 33000 e-mails, 1093, 1104
That to me because it was so simple you know? Not its not about the sale of the uranium that nobody knows what it means I know what it means to Russia, 1104, 1136
Then she talks to me about Russia, 1136, 1143
20 percent of the uranium in our country to Russia.n" But you know the deletion of 33000 e-mails boy that just sort of is so out there after receiving a subpoena from the United States government, 1143, 1179
She lied to Congress she lied to the FBI she made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer, 1179, 1197
The Clinton crew gave more than $675000 to the wife of the deputy director of the FBI  " and the man who was overseeing the investigation into Hillarys illegal server but maybe that takes care of itself, 1197, 1234
Right now that takes care of itself I think I think, 1234, 1245
Very proud that the FBI was willing to do this actually really very proud, 1245, 1259
" n "Just yesterday we learned that Bill Clintons right-hand man pushed for Clintons foundation donors and other large corporations to funnel as much as $66 million in personal profit to Bill and Hillary Clinton.n" "This man explained that the cozy relationship between his consulting firm to foundation and Clintons personal income had helped Bill and Hillary enrich themselves and obtain in-kind services including personal travel hospitality vacations and the like, 1259, 1330
" n The same people paying Bill Clinton for speeches were lobbying Hillary Clinton at the same the same time same time, 1330, 1352
 n And these people are seriously corrupt, 1352, 1359
 n "Terribly conflict, 1359, 1362
Hillarys pay for play included defense contracts, 1362, 1369
Take Raytheon when the contractor wanted big foreign arms deals they hired three lobbyists that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Hillarys last campaign and are raising money for her current campaign.n" "And by the way 50 to 1 in ads 50 to 1, 1369, 1414
And if you look at Florida were winning, 1414, 1422
Ohio were winning, 1422, 1425
Iowa were winning, 1425, 1428
" n "Doing great in New Hampshire, 1428, 1435
I think were going to have a tremendous victory in Pennsylvania, 1435, 1446
" n We better have a great victory in New Hampshire please, 1446, 1458
OK we will, 1458, 1461
 n "In fact when this news when this news of the FBIs investigation when it just happened a little while ago they said Mr, 1461, 1485
Trump I think theyd understand we could skip your speech in New Hampshire this is so big, 1485, 1502
I said I dont have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire, 1502, 1516
Believe me I dont have the courage, 1516, 1523
" n "Im not skipping New Hampshire I never will, 1523, 1533
You know when I won and you remember because I go around and we had the big rallies and they said oh the big rallies will never work in New Hampshire you have to sit down and have dinner with everybody, 1533, 1574
I said thats like thats a lot of dinners, 1574, 1583
They dont expect that.n" "But you remember when we met and Id have a lot of small meetings too with people wed talk and New Hampshire more than any other place taught me about drugs flowing into this country, 1583, 1622
And your police department so great the police departments in New Hampshire they told me, 1622, 1637
I went to some I became friendly with some, 1637, 1646
" n "And I never knew I never knew honestly I knew it was bad I never knew it was so bad, 1646, 1668
And I said to the people of New Hampshire because more than any other place you look at the beautiful little roadways and lakes and streams and everything is so beautiful the trees and you say how could they have a drug problem here? It doesnt fit.n" "But Id sit down with groups and I said whats your biggest problem? And I figured theyd say maybe the veterans which are suffering greatly in this area we understand that, 1668, 1746
But it was always -- and well solve that problem, 1746, 1756
But it was always you know what it was always heroine, 1756, 1767
Id say heroine? What do you mean? And I learned so much, 1767, 1779
And I said to the people of New Hampshire that if I win which I did with New Hampshire if I win and I also said and if I go all the way we are going to stop the inflow of drugs into New Hampshire and into our country 100 percent " n "And I gave the people of New Hampshire my pledge more than anybody else in this case because they really taught me about whats happening with the world of drugs pouring in, 1779, 1864
Hard to believe, 1864, 1867
Its just so so strange when you look and see the beauty of this place and then you see that heroin and drugs are your number one problem by far.n" "Anyway with months these lobbyists sealed over $26 billion in foreign arms deals including over $19 billion in Qatar some people would say Qatar which happened to be off Bill Clinton, 1867, 1928
$1 million as a birthday gift for a few minutes of face time, 1928, 1941
$1 million, 1941, 1943
The lobbyists one of whom was the sister-in-law to Hillary Clintons current campaign chairman received hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees the contractor got billions of dollars in contracts and Hillary Clinton got her campaign cash and money for her foundation.n" And you know Im putting up tremendous amounts of money, 1943, 1995
Today I wrote another check for $10 million, 1995, 2003
Im spending money like crazy, 2003, 2008
Ill probably have over maybe close to or over $100 million of my money spent on the campaign, 2008, 2026
But theres something nice about that, 2026, 2032
Unless I lose in which case I say "What was that all about?" But were gonna do whats right for you not whats right for some contributor or special interest, 2032, 2062
 n "Hillary put the office of the secretary of state up for sale and if she ever got the chance believe me she would put the office and you know what office Im talking about the office called the Oval Office up for sale too, 2062, 2107
I propose a contract with the American voter which will end corruption and give government back to our great people, 2107, 2127
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and heed the words Im about to say and I never loved this expression but now I love it because its become its become the hottest expression, 2127, 2163
If we win on November 8th we are going to Washington D.C, 2163, 2175
when we win OK and we are going to drain the swamp, 2175, 2187
" n "At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs, 2187, 2203
Youve been suffering with the jobs, 2203, 2209
The jobs have gone like candy being taken from a baby, 2209, 2220
New growth numbers just released put the average growth rate for this year at a disastrous 1.5 percent, 2220, 2238
If China goes down to 7 or 8 percent GDP you know its like a national catastrophe, 2238, 2255
Last quarter we were at 1 percent, 2255, 2262
Our job numbers last week were horrible, 2262, 2269
They were anemic as the expression goes, 2269, 2276
They like to say anemic that was the word they used, 2276, 2287
Obama is the first president in modern history not to have a single year of 3 percent growth.n" "And they say its hard because were a large county, 2287, 2315
Well India is a much larger country and theyre at 8 percent, 2315, 2327
China is at 7 percent, 2327, 2332
And Chinas not happy, 2332, 2336
So were at around 1 percent and we just keep going along just keep going along losing our jobs to Mexico and every other place, 2336, 2361
Forty-seven million Americans are on food stamps and 45 million people think of it this is our country are living in poverty.n" Meanwhile our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion a year, 2361, 2397
You say "Who negotiates these contracts?" Were living through Obama, 2397, 2407
Its true, 2407, 2409
You know instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton he ought to be in the White House in the Oval Office negotiating trade deals beating ISIS taking care of our veterans which he does not do, 2409, 2444
Were living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 2444, 2457
Theyre stealing our jobs, 2457, 2461
Greatest in the history of the world.n "New Hampshire has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported strongly by Hillary, 2461, 2490
Weve lost 70000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary disaster.n" "The Trump administration will immediately begin negotiating and we will start this negotiation so fast, 2490, 2521
We will start a negotiation on NAFTA and if we dont get the deal we want we will terminate NAFTA and get a much much better trade deal, 2521, 2549
" n "And I wont go into the details but because theyre different tax systems theyre under a VAT system and were under our system but because of the fact that theyre under a much different tax system the day the deal was signed it was a defective deal with us having a massive at least 17 percent disadvantage.n" "So its complicated, 2549, 2611
Im not going to bother you or bore you with it but weve been working with a defective deal for years and nobody no politician ever went back to renegotiate it, 2611, 2642
Were going to get it done folks so easily, 2642, 2651
" n "If a company wants to fire their workers and go to Mexico or another country and then they think theyre going to ship their products back into the United States we will charge them a tax of 35 percent, 2651, 2692
" n "So when you think these companies which right now are out there negotiating to leave here theyll leave New Hampshire theyll leave Pennsylvania theyre gonna leave Ohio theyre gonna leave all of these places all of our great places and great states, 2692, 2736
And right now as were talking theyre negotiating deals.n" "Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world in terms of the new plants, 2736, 2759
A friend of mine Bill Plante hes the biggest he said the eighth wonder of the world whats happening in Mexico, 2759, 2780
And I say and I tell this to people what about us? He said meh not gonna be its gonna be the other way around, 2780, 2805
" n "But there will be consequences, 2805, 2812
And you know when they realize that theyve got to now pay a tax all of that to come through our very strong border because there will be a strong border " " with their product you know what theyre gonna say? Theyre gonna say lets say were not gonna move and theyre gonna stay, 2812, 2867
Its very simple, 2867, 2870
But the politicians dont want to do that because theyre controlled theyre controlled by the people that give them their campaign contributions and probably other things, 2870, 2896
We will does anybody know what I mean by that? " n We will also stand up to Chinese currency manipulation and we will stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 2896, 2924
 n "We will become a rich nation again but to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation, 2924, 2945
Hillary Clinton unleashed ISIS onto the world and it has now spread into our country, 2945, 2960
There are right now 1000 open ISIS investigations across the United States more than at any time that weve ever had, 2960, 2981
Now Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent " " the massive number of Syrian refugees flowing into our country, 2981, 3001
Thats over the Obama numbers and those are thousands and thousands of people, 3001, 3014

They are so dishonest folks, 3338, 3343
But a lot of these reports coming out in the early voting states people are coming up that have never voted, 3343, 3364
These are great Americans these are great people but theyve just never seen anybody that they wanted to like theyve never heard people say were going to actually bring back your jobs, 3364, 3396
Were not going to let companies leave us and fire everybody and move and then let the product pour into our country with no tax.n" "No no just go ahead leave fire all our people move to Mexico make the product sell your air conditioners Carriers an example theyre leaving they might not leave theyre probably all about ready to change their mind, 3396, 3459
But just let your product come right in no tax no nothing, 3459, 3471
I mean how stupid is this? How stupid?n" And Im a free-trader Im a fair trader, 3471, 3487
But we have the wrong people represent us, 3487, 3495
So whats happening is these lines in Florida are four blocks long, 3495, 3507
They were never like that, 3507, 3512
Theyve never seen anything like it, 3512, 3518
