" Thank you Madam Secretary, 0, 5
This is a big interview for us, 5, 12
Twenty-two years weve been doing this and this is one of our big ones, 12, 26
I want to tell you—want to ask you about 12 questions tonight..."  OK, 26, 39
 .., 39, 40
in two segments, 40, 43
I hope we get through them all, 43, 50
 Thanks Chris, 50, 52
" Back in 2001 when we had 9/11 and you were a senator from New York there was a different spirit in this country including the Republican Party, 52, 80
You had a Republican president who went on the air and made it clear time and again this is not a battle between the West and the East, 80, 108
Its not about Muslims, 108, 112
Its about terrorism, 112, 115
And he did it so effectively." "And now we have the leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president basically declaring a war on Muslims saying theyre not allowed in the country the whole works, 115, 150
What do you make of this?" " Well its deeply distressing to me because I as you know well remember what happened after 9/11, 150, 174
And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that." "And now we need to have a sense of unity and purpose in combatting terrorism, 174, 214
I view it as a threat, 214, 220
I believe ISIS cannot be contained, 220, 226
It has to be defeated, 226, 231
But in order to do that we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans so that what Im hearing from the other side is not only offensive and shameful its dangerous counterproductive, 231, 266
And of course we have to work with countries around the world in order to have a unified coalition against terrorism." "And Ive laid out very clearly what I think needs to be done and it does include an American-led air alliance and were doing that, 266, 312
And were supporting troops on the ground that are not Americans special forces but we do need to have the Kurds and the Arabs with special forces support but not American combat troops." And we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan Afghanistan and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet, 312, 383
"But then the third pillar of my approach is we have to be safe here at home, 383, 400
We have to work with our friends and allies around the world, 400, 412
And I know you just got back from Israel, 412, 421
We have a lot of important work to do with countries from one end of the globe to the other, 421, 441
And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere, 441, 456
And thats what Im advocating." " Thats why Im concerned about the Republican Party because this ethnic way of going at this situation the way they seem to be going at the Muslim people rather than the terrorists—this started—remember when the man whose name we dare not speak anymore Donald Trump—I mean the fact is Trump started his sort of initiation in politics by saying the president of the United States was an illegal immigrant he was probably a Muslim he had a—he almost was an identity thief who created a notion of himself through a phony birth certificate a phony birth announcement and he was somehow—in fact he used to say things—Trump would say things like Nobody knew him in school like hes some phantom impersonator usurper." The Republican Party every time he did that said nothing, 456, 594
 Right, 594, 595
" Boehner the speaker of the House who was pretty much respected wouldnt—isnt this a Republican Party problem that started with Trumps first arrival on the world stage as some sort of politician that its ethnic with them? The president of the United States is one of the bad guys one of the—if not the terrorists one of the sneaker-in-ers who snuck into the country and assumed an identity, 595, 664
Its pretty sick." " Well its very divisive and I think counterproductive, 664, 676
It undermines our values who we are as a people, 676, 686
We are a nation of immigrants which you know so well, 686, 697
And when I hear whats coming from the other side—and its not just one person, 697, 712
Theres an echo chamber there, 712, 717
And its very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer divide and conquer and you know a house divided against itself cannot stand." "We need to be united, 717, 747
And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric who use the kind of derogatory comments whether its about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities whoever it might be, 747, 780
That is not a sign of leadership, 780, 787
Thats a sign of you know showmanship of desperation that should be rejected roundly by the American people."  By the way you know my grandmother spoke Irish when I grew up, 787, 818
I had an Irish accent in the house, 818, 826
 Yes?  Let me ask you about guns.., 826, 833
 I would have guessed that, 833, 838
" Yes, 838, 840
Well lets talk about guns because youve shown a lot of guts out there, 840, 854
And we know all the politics of guns, 854, 862
You know it, 862, 865
You ran with your husband, 865, 870
You ran before for president." There are states that have a real gun culture including the state I grew up in Pennsylvania, 870, 892
And you come from that part of the world in a way, 892, 904
And you do come from   Scranton.., 904, 910
 My father comes from right, 910, 915
" So you know theres a gun culture, 915, 923
How do you deal with that in Electoral College situations where youve got to beat a Republican come next November hopefully for you? How do you—how do you make sure that the gun people dont emotionally say Oh shes an enemy of guns?" " Well I think its important to be focused on what we can do together and thats why I do support comprehensive background checks and to close the gun show loophole and the on-line loophole and whats called the Charleston loophole..."  Right, 923, 1008
 .., 1008, 1009
and to prevent people who are on the no-fly list from getting guns, 1009, 1022
And in fact what I am proposing is supported by a great majority of the American people and a significant majority of gun owners, 1022, 1046
"Just today at Osage—you were here when I was speaking to the crowd—and then afterwards I always take time so people can come up to me, 1046, 1072
Sometimes I do it publicly a lot of times I do it privately whats on their minds." "And a man came up, 1072, 1094
He had a veterans cap on, 1094, 1100
And he said you know Im a gun owner he said but I dont see any reason why we cant do more to keep guns out of the wrong hands."  Yes, 1100, 1131
 And he asked me What can I do? I said Well please stand up against the NRA and the gun lobby, 1131, 1152
And please talk to your friends because what we are proposing is consistent with constitutional rights, 1152, 1168
"But I agree with you Chris its going to be part of the—you know the political debate and frankly the battle in a lot of parts of our country going forward."  Yes, 1168, 1200
" But it is so important when we lose 90 people a day 33000 Americans every year and when you have met as many victims of gun violence as I have when youve sat there and youve listened to their stories about losing a child losing a husband losing a parent—and Ive met with the mothers who have lost children to gun violence by police hands by you know more likely gun and gang—deadly combination, 1200, 1275
Ive just so many people from Columbine to Sandy Hook." "I just cant remain silent, 1275, 1290
And I think we are at a turning point, 1290, 1299
And what I said to the man here is you know There needs to be a rival organization to the NRA of responsible gun owners who know that their hunting rights..."  Moms Demand Action, 1299, 1333
" .., 1333, 1335
their collecting rights all of that is not going to be affected, 1335, 1347
So Im going to keep beating the drum and Im delighted that the president announced the actions he did today." " Well youre back in this fight."  I am, 1347, 1376
 You know you were here eight years ago, 1376, 1384
Here you are again, 1384, 1388
 I am, 1388, 1390
I am, 1390, 1392
 And I do wonder sometimes at you sometimes your ability—your.., 1392, 1402
  To use the word "stamina" that hasnt been used correctly lately, 1402, 1413
You know Im a student of history like you are and I remember Nixon back in 1950 ran against Helen Gehagen Douglas, 1413, 1435
And she was one of the first women liberal to go out there.., 1435, 1448
 She is, 1448, 1450
 .., 1450, 1451
progressives to try to win a big seat, 1451, 1459
Right, 1459, 1460
"And he used to—he said things like You know its awfully hard on a woman, 1460, 1475
"  He used these little shots at her, 1475, 1483
 Yes, 1483, 1484
 Here we are two thirds of a century later.., 1484, 1493
 Right, 1493, 1494
" .., 1494, 1496
and the leading Republican candidate is out saying that you dont have the stamina the strength—is this sexism? Is it what it is?" " Well you know I have a new years resolution..." " I know, 1496, 1532
Ive heard this.., 1532, 1535
"   I will not respond to his you know.., 1535, 1544
 What does it say about the Republican.., 1544, 1551
 .., 1551, 1552
personal attacks, 1552, 1554
 Well let me try to phrase it—I feel like a lawyer now, 1554, 1566
How do I rephrase?   "How does the Republican Party deal with the fact theyre voting for this guy that 35 percent of people are supporting him and even though hes making these charges which a lot of people would say are—why would he go after your stamina rather than Bills stamina or George McGoverns stamina or anybody elses except youre a woman?"  Well look.., 1566, 1630
" Hes older than you." " Thats true." " Im older than you." " Thats true!" " My staminas all right." " Thats true."  So why is he doing this?  Well why does he do whatever he does? I can only tell you what I hear from people and what I hear from people is really about their lives and their future, 1630, 1692
I mean lot of this back and forth that goes on.., 1692, 1703
 I know but.., 1703, 1706
 .., 1706, 1707
in the political.., 1707, 1710
" .., 1710, 1712
hes winning." " .., 1712, 1716
universe—well well see, 1716, 1719
Well see, 1719, 1721
We havent had a single caucus, 1721, 1727
We havent had a single primary, 1727, 1733
The Republicans will have to choose whoever they decide to be their nominee and Im looking forward if I am so fortunate to be the nominee to run against whoever they put up." "Im just going to keep working really hard like right out there today you know getting people to caucus for me connecting them up with my great organizers, 1733, 1794
I have an amazing team here..."  OK.., 1794, 1801
" .., 1801, 1803
and were just going to work as hard as we can to make my case." " He aint going to stop, 1803, 1824
He did an interview with my colleague Joe Scarborough this morning, 1824, 1835
Its going to air tomorrow morning, 1835, 1841
Hes out there again saying hes going after your family, 1841, 1851
He said its fair to go after them."  Well I just.., 1851, 1862
" Hes just going to keep doing it."  Well.., 1862, 1871
" He says youre an enabler, 1871, 1877
Hes making it personal with you." " Well he can say whatever he wants to say, 1877, 1893
Im going to keep talking about what people talk to me about..."  OK, 1893, 1906
 .., 1906, 1907
and what they talk to me about is What will you do about prescription drug prices? " By the way youre good on that one, 1907, 1932
Thats so true." " Well its unbelievable whats happening to people!" " Everybodys taking drugs now and you need—if you have diabetes like me or somebody everybody needs it—if your parents died of Alzheimers—you talked about that out here."  Yes, 1932, 1972
 These are real things, 1972, 1976
 These are real things that people talk to me about, 1976, 1986
 OK.., 1986, 1987
" And Im going to be a president who does the big stuff that gets in the headlines that you know you and other analysts and reporters talk about and Im going to do the stuff that keeps people awake at night..."  OK.., 1987, 2030
 .., 2030, 2031
like you know making sure they can afford their prescription drugs, 2031, 2042
 I want to say something nice about you, 2042, 2050
 Oh please!   " No I have to, 2050, 2057
Im personally responsible, 2057, 2060
Back when you had all the difficulty in the second administration of President Clinton your husband and you had a difficult situation you had to go through—and you went through it and I think you were completely stunned by it initially and then you had to deal with it as you became aware of what was going on." "And what did you do? You didnt cry, 2060, 2126
You didnt go away and say Gee whiz this is terrible why am I going through this? What you did is you went out and you acted like a champion for Democrats, 2126, 2158
You went around the country campaigning like mad, 2158, 2166
You were the real banner carrier for the Democratic Party in 98." And something interesting happened, 2166, 2182
An epiphany happened, 2182, 2185
Somehow out there campaigning in New York for Chuck Schumer and other people you said something to yourself, 2185, 2203
You said You know what? Something good can come out of this for me, 2203, 2217
I can become a hero to people, 2217, 2224
"And you ran for the Senate from New York when a lot of people were critics of you would have loved you to have fallen on your face, 2224, 2252
They would have eaten it up if youd gone down in a ditch up in New York and lost—because at the time you were running against Rudy..." " Thats right."  .., 2252, 2283
who looked unbeatable, 2283, 2286
" Thats right." " And you had the guts to go out there, 2286, 2299
What made you do it? Because theres a lot of women watching right now, 2299, 2313
Half my viewers are women, 2313, 2318
And they want to hear whats it take for a woman to just rise out of a situation which is pretty bad and come out of it and say You know what? I can rise to this occasion, 2318, 2356
How did you do it?" " Well you know thats a great question because I..."  Do you know the answer? " I didnt have any sense that all of this would happen, 2356, 2388
I really didnt."  Well New York came and fell in love with you and said We like you, 2388, 2406
 And—and.., 2406, 2407
 Come up here live up here be our senator, 2407, 2416
 They did and Please run, 2416, 2421
And I said no no no, 2421, 2427
I said no no.., 2427, 2431
 Charlie Rangel.., 2431, 2433
 " Yes and so many others, 2433, 2439
And I absolutely said no, 2439, 2444
And Ill tell you what changed my mind and it was maybe something that other women can relate to because I was in the news like Would she or wouldnt she and I kept saying Im not going to, 2444, 2483
And I was first lady going up to do an event in New York City to promote women in athletics and Billie Jean King and great athletes were there." " Shes great."  And so I was introduced by this young woman, 2483, 2524
I think she was like the volleyball or basketball captain, 2524, 2534
And I came up and shook her hand and you know I said Great job, 2534, 2549
She leaned over to me and she said Dare to compete Mrs, 2549, 2561
Clinton dare to compete, 2561, 2565
And I thought Wow, 2565, 2569
You know I have encouraged so many women and girls to compete on the athletic fields in academics.., 2569, 2587
 Yes, 2587, 2588
" .., 2588, 2590
in politics in business and Im being asked to compete, 2590, 2600
And it..."  And stick your neck out, 2600, 2607
 And stick my neck out, 2607, 2612
And it is scary! It is, 2612, 2618
" Its different than supporting your spouse isnt it." " Totally different, 2618, 2630
?I mean I had the hardest time when I started saying I am me, 2630, 2644
Im happy to say you know my husband this or candidate X or Y but to stand up there and be the person out there..."  Wow, 2644, 2670
" And it is a big challenge, 2670, 2677
And I think because you know were coming into our own as women in all walks of life but still theres something a little bit daunting about..."  Yes, 2677, 2705
" .., 2705, 2707
holding yourself out asking people to support you to give you money to vote for you, 2707, 2723
Its hard."  And you know who went through that? Another New York senator Bobby Kennedy, 2723, 2738
 Yes, 2738, 2739
  " .., 2739, 2741
his brothers brother."  I remember reading about that, 2741, 2749
 And then all of a sudden he had to be the guy and stuck his neck out, 2749, 2766
"Anyway were going to come back and talk about..."  OK, 2766, 2776
" .., 2776, 2778
you because I—the way I look at politics—and you called me an analyst, 2778, 2791
I like that, 2791, 2794
Im an analyst, 2794, 2797
And I look at this race for president 2016 which were now in and really that list is closing, 2797, 2816
And a guy at Georgetown a professor once said theres a difference between free will and free choice, 2816, 2834
Free choice means theres a limit number of choices, 2834, 2843
And it looks like theres a limited number of choices for the president of the United States coming in 2016 and youre one of them." "Well be right back and talk about Hillary Clinton as the possibly the next—in fact the first-ever woman commander-in-chief of the United States."   " Madam Secretary you may have a new title if this campaign is successful, 2843, 2905
You have to win the primary, 2905, 2911
You got to beat Bernie, 2911, 2916
You got to beat Martin OMalley, 2916, 2922
But if all that happens then you have to beat whoever on the Republican side you could be the first woman commander-in-chief." "And this is all happening perhaps coincidentally or maybe culturally when Ashton Carter the secretary of defense has just made it clear now that all combat roles are open to women, 2922, 2975
This is something unique in our history, 2975, 2982
Now maybe every woman doesnt want these jobs."  Right, 2982, 2991
 But these jobs are now open, 2991, 2997
You can go out there and be infantry, 2997, 3005
You can go out there you know with a knife in your teeth and you can go swinging on ropes into whatever valley you got to go kill people in, 3005, 3035
Women are going to be doing that just like in Israel where I just was, 3035, 3050
"Hows our country going to adapt to that? And is it important culturally for us to have women in this combat role?" " I think its important to open up all roles to women but I also agree with Secretary Carter that you have to have standards, 3050, 3097
And women and men have to meet those standards because were talking literally life or death, 3097, 3113
So I am..."  You mean like climbing ropes and things like that, 3113, 3125
 Absolutely, 3125, 3126
Absolutely, 3126, 3127
And how much weight you can carry because maybe one of your you know fellow soldiers will need that one day, 3127, 3148
And so I am a huge supporter of women being able to break whatever glass ceilings are holding them back.., 3148, 3168
 If they can physically handle it, 3168, 3174
" Theyve got to be able—and mentally."  Yes, 3174, 3182
" You know it—physically mentally you have to be prepared, 3182, 3192
You have to be ready, 3192, 3197
And I think that youre right not every womans going to want to do that and some of the women who want to do it are not going to qualify." But we just had a few women pass Ranger school which is an enormously.., 3197, 3241
 Yes, 3241, 3242
 .., 3242, 3243
competitive grueling experience, 3243, 3246
It was just less than a handful but they proved they could do it, 3246, 3260
And from everything I know nobody cut any slack for them, 3260, 3271
They did it, 3271, 3274
And in fact after it was over they interviewed some of the you know male competitors.., 3274, 3290
 Right, 3290, 3291
" .., 3291, 3293
to go through Ranger school and these guys said You know after a while I didnt even notice, 3293, 3311
I mean yes youre right she was a woman, 3311, 3320
She carried her weight, 3320, 3324
She pulled her own."  Yes, 3324, 3329
" Thats what you want because I think about the job that Im applying for and it really is a job interview that Im doing all over America."  Commander-in-chief, 3329, 3358
" President and commander-in-chief, 3358, 3362
And I feel ready to fulfill both roles, 3362, 3370
I think its important that the next president get the economy working for everybody so that we dont keep having the deck stacked for those on the top, 3370, 3398
Weve got to stay safe at home and strong in the world, 3398, 3410
And weve got to deal with these problems that keep people up at night I like to say."  Yes, 3410, 3429
 I feel particularly well prepared to do every part of the job, 3429, 3441
And when it comes to being commander-in-chief my eight years as a senator from New York after 9/11 my four years as secretary of state my many many hours in the Situation Room I know how hard these choices are, 3441, 3481
 You were there when Osama was killed, 3481, 3488
 I was, 3488, 3490
You know I was one of the very few people that was brought in to advise the president, 3490, 3508
 Yes, 3508, 3509
 And it was the most.., 3509, 3514
 You said Go for it, 3514, 3519
 I did, 3519, 3521
I did you know after as I say sitting through hours of meetings listening to the intelligence being presented listening to Admiral McRaven who was then the head of special forces talk about you know what special forces could do looking at other options.., 3521, 3565
 Yes, 3565, 3566
 .., 3566, 3567
like a cruise missile or a Predator—armed predator and recommending to the president that we go with the Navy SEAL option and then being there that day watching part of the operation on a video screen in the Situation Room just holding my breath literally through the whole thing, 3567, 3616
I know how hard these choices are, 3616, 3623
And I know what a cool deliberative head needs to be finally making them, 3623, 3637
 Yes, 3637, 3638
 I have learned so much Chris over the last years, 3638, 3648
I feel very ready, 3648, 3652
 You have the—you know who said you had the temperament for it? Bill Clinton which I thought was interesting because he would know your temperament, 3652, 3677
 Yes, 3677, 3678
Yes, 3678, 3679
 Let me ask about your sort of position on this, 3679, 3689
You voted for the Iraq War authorization if not the war, 3689, 3700
"Bernie Sanders is out there still hitting you on that one, 3700, 3711
Of course hes coming from the left on you, 3711, 3720
You have got Rand Paul out there who is a libertarian and a bit of a—I would say a bit of a dove saying that you would be more for regime change that you would start the next war." " Yes, 3720, 3761
Well hes wrong, 3761, 3764
He is wrong." " Theyre positioning you as to the hawkish side of Obama."  Yes, 3764, 3779
Right, 3779, 3780
 How—where would you—you read Fred Hiatt of "The Washington Post" the other day.., 3780, 3793
 Yes, 3793, 3794
 .., 3794, 3795
position you as someone I thought a notch to the hawkish side because he said you were for a no-fly zone in Syria, 3795, 3818
You were for ground troops but not necessarily our troops but some.., 3818, 3830
 Right, 3830, 3831
 Because you need a ground component to tell the bombs where to—to tell them where to drop the bombs, 3831, 3850
 Right, 3850, 3851
Exactly, 3851, 3852
Right, 3852, 3853
 Does that make you more hawkish than the president?  Well I think most of what I have been advocating the president is now doing, 3853, 3877
 But not that, 3877, 3880
 Well we have special forces on the ground, 3880, 3888
He sent them, 3888, 3891
 But no-fly zone?  But the no-fly zone for me was an idea that I developed with some advisers, 3891, 3909
 Is it dangerous with the Russians flying around there?  Well of course you would have to have the Russians to sign off on it, 3909, 3933
 Yes, 3933, 3934
 And we were making progress, 3934, 3939
"I dont know what the result will be of the conflict now between Saudi Arabia and Iran, 3939, 3956
But you know for the last four years we have been pushing to try to get a peace conference going." "And I give Secretary Kerry credit for getting everybody agreeing to be in the same room, 3956, 3992
I saw the no-fly zone as leverage, 3992, 3999
Number one if we could get the Russians on board because we would have to—and I think we could if we were to say look we need safe zones, 3999, 4028
If were going to be operating on the ground advising the Kurds the Arabs we need safe zones." "We also need safe places for civilians so that theyre not refugees leaving Iraq and Syria, 4028, 4062
And it can be done, 4062, 4067
It can be done in a way that doesnt create more problems." "But now Im—Im very supportive of what the presidents doing, 4067, 4089
Were making some progress, 4089, 4093
And I have been calling for that calling for reconstituting the approach toward the sheiks the Sunni sheiks in Anbar Province getting them back into the fight so to speak."  Yes, 4093, 4124
 They are, 4124, 4126
Rebuilding the Iraqi army, 4126, 4130
" Yes, 4130, 4132
Thats what we need."  We need that, 4132, 4139
" We need the Sunnis to retake their land because the Shia cant do it."  We need the—well the still largely Shia Iraqi army took Ramadi but with Sunni troops, 4139, 4169
 Army, 4169, 4170
They have to turn it over to Sunnis, 4170, 4178
 And then turn it over, 4178, 4183
 Yes, 4183, 4184
 This makes all the sense in the world to me, 4184, 4194
"So I view myself as being a realist being practical and in accordance with our values because I think its very important that we get back to promoting our values and pursuing our interests and protecting our security." "If the United States doesnt do that on our own behalf or on behalf of our friends in Europe and Asia and the Middle East no one will, 4194, 4260
So this is not a choice, 4260, 4266
Its not a luxury, 4266, 4270
Its a necessity." " OK, 4270, 4275
Last question, 4275, 4277
Were running out of time." I want to try to help you for this audience tonight our audience locate yourself politically in this country, 4277, 4301
  Now we have Trump out there and we have Bernie out here, 4301, 4313
"Now Bernie calls himself a socialist, 4313, 4319
Nobody uses a derogatory term anymore, 4319, 4325
Its—he loves to have that label, 4325, 4331
Hes never ran as a Democrat, 4331, 4337
He runs against Democrats up there in Vermont." "Youre a Democrat, 4337, 4348
I would say youre a pretty typical Democrat in the tradition of the Democratic Party and Humphrey the rest of them Scoop—not even Scoop, 4348, 4372
I would say Mondale, 4372, 4376
Youre somewhere in there." "Whats the difference between a socialist and a Democrat?"  Well you have to.., 4376, 4393
 Is that a question you want to answer or would you rather not?    Well you would have to ask.., 4393, 4412
  " Well see Im asking you, 4412, 4418
Youre a Democrat, 4418, 4421
Hes a socialist, 4421, 4424
Would you like somebody to call you a socialist? I wouldnt like somebody calling me a socialist." " Well but Im not one, 4424, 4447
Im not one." " OK, 4447, 4452
Well whats the difference between a socialist and a Democrat? Last question."  Well I can tell you what I am, 4452, 4472
I am a progressive Democrat, 4472, 4477
I am a progressive Democrat.., 4477, 4482
 How is that different than a socialist? " .., 4482, 4491
who likes to get things done and who believes that were better off in this country when were trying to solve problems together getting people to work together." "There will always be strong feelings and I respect that from you know the far right the far left libertarians whatever—whoever it might be, 4491, 4543
We need to get people working together, 4543, 4550
We have got to get the economy fixed, 4550, 4558
We have got to get all of our problems you know really tackled, 4558, 4571
And thats what I want to do."  I know, 4571, 4580
"Yes I think the difference is—and Debbie Wasserman Schultz wouldnt answer the question either I asked her because I know politically you have to keep together, 4580, 4606
The center-left and the left has to work together, 4606, 4615
I know all that." Let me ask you about working together, 4615, 4626
You gave a nice speech here today in Osage about the need to work—I wrote a book about Tip and Reagan, 4626, 4647
When it comes to an urgent issue they can find a solution, 4647, 4659
 Right, 4659, 4660
 Obama—I have always supported the president on his philosophy on his general approach to a lot of things, 4660, 4678
"But he doesnt seem to like the company of fellow politicians, 4678, 4689
He just doesnt, 4689, 4692
He doesnt want to hang out with them play cards with them at midnight, 4692, 4706
Maybe he did it in Springfield, 4706, 4712
For some reason he doesnt want to do it in Washington." You seem to like the company of people like Lindsey Graham and John McCain, 4712, 4737
And you can find a way go on CODELs with them and getting along with them, 4737, 4753
And it seems to me that is an important part of life that you have to find—you were talking about Tom DeLay here, 4753, 4776
And I get along with Tom DeLay, 4776, 4783
Even though you disagree 180 on something you have got to find—Congress means coming together, 4783, 4798
 Yes, 4798, 4799
Well your book is a perfect example of.., 4799, 4807
 "Tip and the Gipper."  Exactly, 4807, 4812
And look there may be.., 4812, 4817
 You read it?  I did, 4817, 4822
 Thank you, 4822, 4824
" I dont—I dont want you to know that but I did." " But you have just told me that, 4824, 4844
I like this, 4844, 4847
Youre throwing me an encomium here, 4847, 4853
"   No because I—because I am always looking for ways that we work together, 4853, 4867
 Yes, 4867, 4868
 And it used to be easier in the past, 4868, 4877
 It did, 4877, 4879
 I think that the polarization has gotten so acute now and so you have to work even harder, 4879, 4897
But relationships are the beginning of everything, 4897, 4904
" So you could imagine if youre fortunate to become the next president of the United States having people over to the White House not going to the Jefferson Hotel for an hour-and-a-half but actually having people come over and talk it over?"  Yes well.., 4904, 4949
" By the way youre an empty nester so its easier for you."  It is easier, 4949, 4965
 Yes, 4965, 4966
 It is much easier, 4966, 4970
And look everybody has strengths that they bring to this position, 4970, 4981
And obviously.., 4981, 4983
 Is schmoozing one of yours?  Well I think that I like it because I am looking for that common ground somewhere, 4983, 5004
 Yes, 5004, 5005
Yes, 5005, 5006
" And I dont think that you get it just on the first try."  Yes, 5006, 5021
 You have got to listen to people, 5021, 5028
You got to get to know people, 5028, 5035
You got to look for ways that you can reach across the aisle, 5035, 5048
 Yes, 5048, 5049
" Im not saying its going to be magic because part of whats happened—and it is different from when Tip ONeill and President Reagan were working together—it is so much more gerrymandered, 5049, 5081
Its so much more influenced..." " I know, 5081, 5089
You dont have any Republicans in a Democratic district."  Not anymore, 5089, 5100
" You dont have any Democrats in a Republican district." " And so people dont feel like they have to make deals." " OK, 5100, 5124
I have been telling people for years that when theyre with you personally youre very different and youre very easy to talk to, 5124, 5147
"  I think watching you the last 20 minutes they get the point, 5147, 5160
 Thank you, 5160, 5162
 I think this has been a great interview, 5162, 5170
And I appreciate you for coming on and giving us the time, 5170, 5182
 Thank you very much Chris, 5182, 5187
Great to see you, 5187, 5191
 Thank you Madam Secretary, 5191, 5195
