Thank you, 0, 2
In 18 days we are going to win the state of North Carolina and we are going to win the White House, 2, 24
"Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns -- raised from special interests -- and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen LA Times and Investors Business Daily." Early voting is underway so make sure to send in your ballot, 24, 72
Together we are going to deliver real change that puts America First, 72, 84
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes and regulations unleash job-producing American energy rebuild our military and take care of our Vets and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare, 84, 131
"Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration, 131, 140
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration, 140, 149
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration, 149, 159
Your companies wont be leaving North Carolina under a Trump Administration." We will be a strong nation again, 159, 177
American Leadership has grown so weak that the Philippines have broken with decades of pro-American foreign policy to instead leave for the orbit of China and Russia, 177, 204
Strength will also require growth, 204, 209
"Right now our economy isnt growing at all, 209, 217
We had only around 1% growth in the last quarter, 217, 227
Im going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years." Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago they are working harder and longer but making less, 227, 264
Some of them are working two three jobs but still taking home less money, 264, 278
Companies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico, 278, 289
Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico, 289, 300
"When Im President if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States, 300, 334
That means the companies wont leave in the first place and if they do well at least make money when they ship their products across the border." "Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries – including millions of dollars from corporations and countries pushing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 334, 394
Thats how our system is corrupt and broken." "Were going to take on big donors big business and big media that have enriched themselves at your expense." The media is so corrupt that Hillary was given the exact questions to a previous debate word for word by Donna Brazile – who is now under tremendous pressure to resign, 394, 452
Hillary was given the questions used the questions and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate, 452, 471
Years ago there was a show called the $64000 question – a contestant got the questions in advance his life was ruined, 471, 493
This is even bigger because we are playing for the presidency of the United States, 493, 508
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency, 508, 523
"Now from WikiLeaks weve just learned she tried to get $12 million from the King of Morocco for an appearance – more pay-for-play." That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again, 523, 564
"Its time to drain the swamp in Washington D.C." Those reforms include the following: A 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service, 564, 594
A lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, 594, 608
A complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, 608, 619
Additionally I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress, 619, 638
Not only will we end government corruption but we will end economic stagnation, 638, 651
My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: Jobs Jobs Jobs At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, 651, 682
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps, 682, 696
We have nearly an $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 696, 720
North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton, 720, 743
"Weve lost 70000 factories since Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal." We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 743, 775
A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA stand up to foreign cheating and stop the jobs from leaving our country, 775, 796
We are going to start making things in America again – and we are going to start making things in North Carolina again, 796, 819
In order to bring manufacturing back to North Carolina Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania and so many other places we are going to undertake a major reform of our federal bureaucracy, 819, 848
American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture Commerce Labor State and Treasury Department and the U.S, 848, 874
Trade Representative, 874, 876
In my administration all trade policymaking will be consolidated into one Office, 876, 888
It will report to what we call the American Desk, 888, 898
The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker and the national interests of the United States, 898, 923
"Its going to be America First." As part of our plan to bring back our jobs we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent, 923, 953
We are also going to rebuild our inner cities, 953, 962
African- Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering, 962, 973
The violence is unbearable, 973, 977
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot, 977, 989
There is no education there are no jobs there is no safety, 989, 1001
Nearly 3500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, 1001, 1015
"Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 1015, 1023
and more than 60% in Baltimore, 1023, 1029
And its getting worse." To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, 1029, 1052
I will fix it, 1052, 1056
We will be a rich nation once again, 1056, 1064
But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country, 1064, 1077
National Security begins at the border, 1077, 1083
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." "Hillarys plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores." So let me state this as clearly as I can, 1083, 1136
"If Im elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country." We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration, 1136, 1161
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders, 1161, 1170
And yes we will build a wall, 1170, 1177
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, 1177, 1189
"As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldnt take them back." It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl, 1189, 1236
In August Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times his victims included one 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home, 1236, 1270
He left her on the side of a dirt road, 1270, 1280
A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran Marilyn Pharis was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported – but never was, 1280, 1312
What kind of government allows its citizens to suffer such horrors? Either we win this election or we lose the country, 1312, 1333
A victory in November will be a victory for you the American people, 1333, 1346
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1346, 1431
You have 18 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true, 1431, 1448
Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens, 1448, 1465
"Its a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment." I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation, 1465, 1496
"Im going to fight for every child living in poverty." "Im going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence." "Im going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like North Carolina and shipped to other countries." "Im going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests." And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1496, 1587
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1587, 1608
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life." "Youre going to remember this day." "This is a movement like youve never seen before." "Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most" "important vote youve ever cast for anyone at any time." Because if we win – We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1608, 1674
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1674, 1680
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1680, 1686
And We Will Make America Great Again, 1686, 1693
