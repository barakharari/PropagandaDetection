 "Thank you! Thank you all so much! Wow, 0, 8
It is so great to be back here in Pittsburgh, 8, 18
I do not think it gets any better than to be accompanied out onto the stage by Dan and Pat Rooney, 18, 39
I am a big admirer of the Rooney family and I was so honored to serve with Dan when he was our ambassador to Ireland, 39, 64
"The Rooney family commitment to Pittsburgh is really extraordinary and its not just the amazing commitment to the Stealers, 64, 83
As special as that is but to their roots what they believe in their values and their deep concern for future generations, 83, 105
So I am incredibly humbled to be supported by Dan and Pat and the Rooney family, 105, 121
It means a great deal to both Tim and me." I also want to thank congressman Mike Doyle who is here with us, 121, 144
Allegheny and county executive Richard Fitzgerald who is here, 144, 153
Mayor Bill Peduto, 153, 156
Mayor John Federman, 156, 159
Pennsylvania attorney general Bruce Beemer, 159, 164
And all the other elected officials it means a lot for you to be here with us, 164, 181
If all goes well in 17 days we are looking forward to working with you on behalf of Pittsburgh, 181, 200
Some of you know that I have a special place in my heart for Pennsylvania and I am excited about helping in any way that we can for Pittsburgh Allegheny county and western Pennsylvania to keep moving forward with confidence and optimism about what is possible for the future we want to create together, 200, 254
I am thrilled to be here with Tim Kaine, 254, 263
I asked him to be my running mate because I knew he would be one of the smartest toughest most qualified vice presidents we have ever had, 263, 290
And I also knew he had never lost an election, 290, 300
I kind of figured that might rub off on me a little bit, 300, 313
Now that I have gotten to spend more time with him and with his wonderful wife Anne and their family I am even more confident that he will be such an extraordinary leader for our country, 313, 349
He is not just smart tough and qualified Tim Kaine is as good and decent a person as you will ever meet, 349, 371
I am deeply honored to have him by my side in this campaign, 371, 384
Tim and I are excited by all of the energy and enthusiasm we are seeing across the country and particularly here in Pennsylvania, 384, 407
"But both of us unlike our opponent do not believe we can do this alone, 407, 422
We believe that we are going to do this by working with all of you, 422, 437
And that we are going to come together in the next 17 days and convince everybody you can to get out and vote because whatever issue you care about its going to be on the ballot, 437, 473
It may not be listed but it will be on the ballot." Whether you care about new good jobs with a rising incomes or you care about better education or you care about what we can do to get the cost of prescription drugs down, 473, 518
What ever it is you care about it is literally going to be on that ballot, 518, 534
"Now my name and Tims name may be the ones on the ballot but we are going to be representing everything that we can do that you hope for our country, 534, 565
And were going to need help doing that after the election and that is why I hope you will do everything you can to elect Katie Mcginty your next senator." You know Katie is the daughter of a Philadelphia police officer, 565, 606
I think she is one of 10 children right? One of 10 children, 606, 619
She has devoted her professional life to protecting working families, 619, 629
I have known her now for more than 20 years when she was really young and I have seen that same can-do spirit, 629, 652
She just gets up every day and asks what can she do to fight for healthier neighborhoods to keep our kids and healthy to fight for cleaner air and cleaner water to help people make the most out of their own lives, 652, 694
Now she is running for the senate because like Tim and I she believes our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top, 694, 720
"Katie is exactly the kind of partner we need in the senate, 720, 732
But more importantly she is exactly the kind of senator that Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania needs in the senate, 732, 751
We have got to get things done for the people of Pennsylvania and America and Katie will help us break through the gridlock actually make a difference in peoples lives help us create more good jobs with rising incomes guarantee equal pay for women defending planned parenthood." "And I think it is pretty clear when you look at Katies opponent -- he still refuses to stand up to Donald Trump." "A lot of republicans have, 751, 826
They have had the grit to stand up and say he does not represent me." "But Pat Toomey heard Donald attack a grieving gold star family who lost their son in Iraq, 826, 858
He heard Donald called Mexican immigrants rapists he heard him say terrible things about women, 858, 873
He heard him spread the lie that our first black president wasnt really born in America -- how much more does Pat Toomey need to hear? If he doesnt have the courage to stand up to Donald Trump after all this then can you be sure he will stand up for you when it counts against powerful interests?" "So you know when I look at this Im thinking to myself we have work to do in Washington, 873, 950
And I know its not easy, 950, 956
I understand we have some real challenges, 956, 963
I believe we can do it, 963, 969
I would not be standing here Tim would not be with me -- but we need people in Washington who put you first who get up every day thinking about middle-class families who worry about where you are going to get the money to send your kids to college how you are going to take care of your mom or dad because they are failing and what are you going to do for them? How are you going to deal with all of the challenges? That is what I try to do my entire life, 969, 1064
That is who you should be electing people who care about you your families your children." Now as Tim said he asked if any of you watched the debate on Wednesday, 1064, 1095
Well I will tell you that was the third and last time I will ever have to debate Donald Trump, 1095, 1115
I mean think about this I have now spent 4 and a half hours on stage with Donald proving once again I have the stamina to be President and commander in chief, 1115, 1147
"And after every one of those debates people have said how did you do that? And really you just have to be of good cheer when you find yourself in a situation like that, 1147, 1181
You are in front of 50 60 70 80 million people, 1181, 1192
So no matter what he would say I just kept thinking of all the people I have met throughout this campaign, 1192, 1213
Just early today Ive met Henry over there, 1213, 1221
Henry is on top of his dads shoulders and Henry gave me a note saying he hoped I would be president and you know I really want to be president for all of the kids in America to do everything I can to help you." You know I also did have a chance to talk about some of the important concerns people have shared with me, 1221, 1287
From the first day I started this campaign back in april 2015 people have been telling me what is on their minds and it is one of the greatest honors, 1287, 1317
"You know sometimes it is just fleeting, 1317, 1324
I will be in a coffee shop shaking hands or I will come down and shake hands on a rope line just running into somebody, 1324, 1349
And that person that man or woman or that young person takes a moment to stop looks into my eyes, 1349, 1369
I can tell they are trying to take my measure and I am grateful that they take their vote their choice so seriously, 1369, 1392
And then they might say something like I have a really terrible problem in my family, 1392, 1408
My son or my daughter has gotten addicted to opiates or to heroin, 1408, 1421
What are you going to do about it? Or maybe they will say my brother has schizophrenia and we cant afford to get him the kind of consistent care he needs , 1421, 1452
Or maybe they will say I am a diabetic, 1452, 1461
And the drug company has just raised the cost of insulin and I cant afford it, 1461, 1477
What are you going to do about it?" That is the right question to ask anybody running for president because at the end of the day this is about you, 1477, 1507
As I said the other night we are going to invest in the middle class, 1507, 1522
We are going to grow this economy from the middle out and the bottom up not the top down, 1522, 1541
And we are going to make sure that we produce a enough good jobs with rising incomes so that every single person especially every single young person in America can go as far as your hard work and talent will take you, 1541, 1583
"Now Ive got to say I believe in hard work, 1583, 1593
That is how I was raised, 1593, 1599
I believe youve got to work for what you get in life, 1599, 1611
But I think we have to knock down some of the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and going as far as they should, 1611, 1639
For me that starts by believing in our country." You know there has been no other place in the history of the world that has given so much opportunity to so many, 1639, 1671
Do we have problems? We have problems, 1671, 1678
Do we have challenges? Of course we do, 1678, 1686
We are human beings, 1686, 1690
But boy there is no more blessed place, 1690, 1698
And Donald Trump did something the other night that no other presidential nominee has ever done of either party, 1698, 1717
He refused to say he would respect the results of this election, 1717, 1729
"Make no mistakes about this my friends, 1729, 1736
He is threatening our democracy, 1736, 1741
Look I have lost elections, 1741, 1746
You dont feel very good the next day believe me, 1746, 1756
But we know in our country the difference between leadership and dictatorship right?" You know the peaceful transition of power is one of those things that sets us apart and whether you support me or my opponent together we must show we support American democracy, 1756, 1801
And I believe both Donald Trump and I should be grateful for the opportunities that our country has given us, 1801, 1821
And the best way to demonstrate that we support our democracy is to turn out and vote, 1821, 1838
And there is an inspiring story being written by people across America right now, 1838, 1852
We have just reached a milestone more than 200 million Americans are registered to vote in this election, 1852, 1870
And you know what? That includes 50 -- more than 50 million young people, 1870, 1884
More than ever before, 1884, 1888
I find that a very hopeful sign, 1888, 1895
And here in Pennsylvania hundreds of thousands of more voters are registered then were in 2012, 1895, 1911
What does this tell us? I think it tells us no matter how much negativity is out there something exciting is happening right now, 1911, 1935
People are coming together -- democrats republicans independents -- all to reject hate and division, 1935, 1950
And in the states where they can people are motivated to vote early to defend core American values and embrace a future where every person counts everyone has a place everyone can contribute, 1950, 1983
You see despite what Donald Trump may think most Americans really believe we can do better, 1983, 1999
Most Americans really believe women should be respected, 1999, 2007
Most Americans really believe that workers should be paid fairly, 2007, 2017
Most Americans be-lieve that the United States should work with our allies to lead the world and keep us safe, 2017, 2037
The energy we are seeing in the final weeks of this campaign is about more than winning an election, 2037, 2056
It is about standing up to the kind of country that we want for ourselves and our children, 2056, 2074
And it is about the kind of lessons we want to teach our sons and daughters, 2074, 2090
I want you to know if Tim and I are fortunate enough to be your president and vice president we will work with everyone, 2090, 2114
Now I imagine here in allegheny county and if you are from further west you probably know people who are thinking about voting for Donald Trump, 2114, 2140
And here is what I want you to tell them, 2140, 2150
I want you to tell them that I understand that they need a president who cares about them will listen to them and I want to be their president too, 2150, 2180
Because whether you agree or disagree with me whether you vote for me or vote against me I believe we can disagree without being disagreeable, 2180, 2205
I have seen that, 2205, 2209
I know it can happen, 2209, 2214
And I know there are a lot of people here in Pennsylvania who have a lot of questions, 2214, 2232
They want to know how do we move forward better, 2232, 2242
They want to know about their town where there used to be a lot of jobs and there are not as many any more, 2242, 2266
They are upset what they see around them, 2266, 2274
I get that, 2274, 2277
But anger is not a plan, 2277, 2283
"And we need -- we need to work together, 2283, 2292
We need plans that will help us deal with the legitimate concerns and questions that people have in Pennsylvania, 2292, 2311
I think that is what our whole country needs right now, 2311, 2322
Thats what I will try to do, 2322, 2329
I am not going to pretend that we can snap our fingers and solve our problems, 2329, 2345
That does not happen in the real world, 2345, 2353
But I know we can make progress together, 2353, 2361
The choice we face in this election is stark especially when it comes to the economy." "Tim and I believe when the middle class thrives America thrives, 2361, 2388
And when we invest in working families in the middle class in small businesses we can make the economy work again for everybody, 2388, 2411
I think it is fair to say that both Donald Trump and Pat Toomey have a different perspective, 2411, 2429
They believe -- and they believe this -- if you give trillions of dollars -- and they mean trillion with a t -- of tax cuts to millionaires billionaires corporations it will all trickle down to everybody else, 2429, 2467
It has not worked before and it has caused us a lot of messes we have had to clean up and I have been privileged to see presidents up close and personal -- right, 2467, 2501
Married to one thats right, 2501, 2506
Worked for one." And here is what I know, 2506, 2515
That when you focus on helping the middle class you end up lifting everybody, 2515, 2529
When you focus on helping the top you help the top, 2529, 2540
That is not good enough, 2540, 2545
Donald likes to say he is on the side of American workers but his actions tell a different story, 2545, 2564
Yes he has bought cheap Chinese steel and aluminum for his construction projects, 2564, 2577
He should be buying good American-made steel that supports good American jobs, 2577, 2589
"I would like to hear Donald explain to American steelworkers filing for unemployment why he put Chinese steel workers to work instead of steelworkers here in Pennsylvania, 2589, 2616
And for all his talk about putting America first he has made many of his products in 12 different countries, 2616, 2636
So if he wants to make America great again why doesnt he start by making things in America? And we now know -- we now know he hasnt paid a dime in federal income taxes for years, 2636, 2673
He says that makes him smart, 2673, 2679
Well I dont know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in a year in the first place, 2679, 2701
Especially -- answer me this -- how do you lose a billion dollars when you are in the casino business?" Never could figure that out, 2701, 2726
But what it means is that every one of us is paying more in federal income taxes than a billionaire has, 2726, 2747
That is wrong and we will end of those kinds of loopholes and gimmicks, 2747, 2761
"I will tell you what, 2761, 2766
It also means Donald has contributed zero -- zero for our military zero for our vets zero for pell grants to help young people go to college zero for our highways zero for everything, 2766, 2800
And yet he stands up on stage and criticizes America, 2800, 2810
Well its unfair and its wrong, 2810, 2816
With your help we will make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II jobs in infrastructure, 2816, 2835
Our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our water systems all need help and those are a lot of good jobs waiting to be done jobs that cant be exported out of Pennsylvania." I believe we can bring advanced manufacturing back to the United States, 2835, 2881
That is why we will invest $10 billion in a make it in America partnerships that brings together workers and unions and businesses universities and community colleges, 2881, 2908
Some countries are going to take the lead with precision machineries, 2908, 2919
Some countries is going to take the lead with 3-d printing, 2919, 2930
We invented both of those technologies, 2930, 2936
We should take the lead and we should have the jobs, 2936, 2947
"We are also going to fight climate change with clean renewable energy jobs, 2947, 2960
And we are going to help small businesses which will create two thirds of all of the new jobs in America, 2960, 2981
And we are going to defend your right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and benefits, 2981, 2999
Dont let anybody fool you my friends, 2999, 3006
assault on worker rights and unions is an assault on the middle class." It is time to say loudly and clearly right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America, 3006, 3038
"So I have set some big goals, 3038, 3045
I am excited about what we are going to do, 3045, 3055
And its all going to put people to work right here, 3055, 3066
And sometimes folks say to me how are you going to get that done? You go to the congress —well first of all I hope we will elect some or democrats, 3066, 3097
That will be job number one, 3097, 3103
Number two I think it will be a very simple question, 3103, 3114
Our members of congress members of the senate going to be on the side of the rich the powerful and the wealthy or on your side? And you know what? They are going to have to answer that question, 3114, 3153
Because if they stay beholden to the special interest if they continue to do the bidding of the lobbyist and lawyers and others who stand outside their doors -- I have been in the senate, 3153, 3188
I have seen it, 3188, 3192
I know it, 3192, 3195
If they are going to continue to do the work of those who are already privileged in America then I want to make sure that they dont come back to Washington after the next election." We are in a great great high school here and I am so proud to be here, 3195, 3247
And so we are going to be a good partner with education especially with educators, 3247, 3262
We are going to start with universal pre-k, 3262, 3270
We want good schools with good teachers in every zip code so every kid gets a world-class education, 3270, 3288
And I want us to bring technical education back to high school, 3288, 3300
I think it was a mistake when we took it out, 3300, 3311
"There are a lot of good jobs that you can be prepared for in todays economy -- coming out of high school maybe going to community college going into an apprenticeship program and I want to lift up that work, 3311, 3351
A four-year college degree should not be and is not the only way to have a good job with the rising income and a satisfying life." We are going to make public colleges and universities tuition free for any families making less than $125000 a year, 3351, 3397
And we are going to help you pay down your college debt, 3397, 3409
"Its going to be great, 3409, 3414
To help you pay it back as a percentage of your income at your job so you are never on the hook for more than you can afford, 3414, 3442
I worked on this with Senator Bernie Sanders and its going to help save -- its going to help save people thousands of dollars." In fact after a year maybe after you are here -- you can go to hillaryclin-ton.com/calculator to see how much your family can save, 3442, 3490
We want you to know we are going to deliver results for you, 3490, 3503
"I mean ultimately its pretty simple, 3503, 3509
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and I want everybody to have your chance to get your piece of the American dream." "So theres a lot of work we are going to be doing, 3509, 3547
We need to raise the national mini-mum wage, 3547, 3555
People who work full-time should not be mired in poverty, 3555, 3565
We are as Tim said going to guarantee equal pay for women, 3565, 3577
You know look its not just a womans issue, 3577, 3586
If you have a mother which all of us do -- if you have a mother a wife a daughter or a sister whos working its your issue, 3586, 3614
Its good for the entire family its good for our economy." "So my friends there is a lot for us to do in the next 17 days, 3614, 3641
Because we have got to get the word out, 3641, 3650
We have got to tell everybody what we are doing and why this election is so critically important, 3650, 3668
And thats where all of you come in, 3668, 3676
If you do know people who are thinking about voting for our opponent."  Nope!  Well you may, 3676, 3693
You know I hope you will stage an intervention, 3693, 3702
And I do hope you will talk about you know the reality versus the demagoguery of what we have seen in this campaign, 3702, 3725
"You know we need to come together around all of the issues that are important to everybody and as I said in the beginning whatever issue you care about its going to be on the ballot, 3725, 3761
I care a lot about making sure that women and girls are treated with dignity and respect that they deserve in our country." I care a lot about making sure that we save social security and we ensure that everybody has the benefits that they need in order to be able to live a decent life in retirement, 3761, 3819
And boy do I care a lot about our constitution, 3819, 3829
"And maybe its because on your behalf I went to 112 countries as your secretary of state, 3829, 3846
And I met a lot of people who in the us because we have been so steady and so committed to our constitutional system and our values, 3846, 3873
And what I hope is that you care as deeply as our founders did as our parents and grandparents did because maybe they came from somewhere else where they werent treated right, 3873, 3905
Maybe they saw firsthand what it meant to be deprived of the rule of law." "You know every time Donald Trump says he wants to jail his opponent meaning me I think to myself you know we dont do that in America, 3905, 3947
We actually have laws and courts and an independent judiciary." Or you know when he blows up at a journalist or criticizes the press and goes on and on and on, 3947, 3978
"You know I get criticized by the press, 3978, 3986
I know that is part of our democratic system, 3986, 3995
We believe in a free press, 3995, 4001
And boy if you go to countries where there isnt one you will understand why that is so important." And when he says there should be a religious test -- a religious test for people at our borders a country founded on religious freedom, 4001, 4045
You have to ask yourself who is going to conduct the test? Are we going to get a quiz? What if the border security official does not believe you? Who gets to decide whether you get to come in or out based on your religion? "And if you havent seen it yet I hope you will go and look at the extraordinary statement by Mr, 4045, 4110
Khan on Youtube in a new video that we have put out, 4110, 4122
You remember he pulled out a constitution at our convention, 4122, 4132
And he reveres our constitution, 4132, 4137
And for good reason, 4137, 4141
Because he too came from a place where the was no rule of law to speak of." "So whatever issue you care about this is an issue that will be decided by this election and that is why Im reaching out to republicans democrats independents everyone, 4141, 4187
I know if we bring our talent our energy and our ambition to the work of building our country we are going to see the best days of America ahead of us and when your chil-dren and your grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line I hope you will say you voted for a better America." "So here we go, 4187, 4253
Just remember -- youve got to get out and vote youve got to get everybody you know to get out and vote, 4253, 4275
If you do not know where to vote please go to iwillvote.com, 4275, 4287
You can put your information in and it is the magic of the internet, 4287, 4301
They will tell you where you are supposed to vote, 4301, 4311
You can go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer, 4311, 4321
Or you can take your phone out right and text join to 47246, 4321, 4334
And if we can get all of you and everybody you know involved in this next 17 days I will tell you this -- it is easy to forget how far our country has come." "There are a lot of people here -- as I said whose parents and grandparents came here as immigrants, 4334, 4388
My grandfather Hugh Rodam came as an immigrant as a young boy and settled in Scranton, 4388, 4404
And he went to work in the Scranton lace mills he went to work in his teens he worked there until he retired at the age of 65, 4404, 4432
He believed in our country, 4432, 4437
He believed in the kind of future he could get through his hard work, 4437, 4451
That is what I want everybody in our country to believe again, 4451, 4463
We are going to unleash the talent the innovation the energy that brought people like my grandfather here but which we will harness for the future, 4463, 4489
Dont let anybody tell you Americas best days are behind us, 4489, 4500
Dont believe that for a minute." We are going to pull together, 4500, 4512
We are going to make it clear that confidence and opti-mism respect for each other bringing folks together who may disagree but can begin to find common ground is what has always worked and it will work again, 4512, 4550
Help us, 4550, 4552
Help us create that kind of future and help us prove once and for all that love trumps hate, 4552, 4571
Thank you all." , 4571, 4574
