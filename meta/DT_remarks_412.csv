On November 8th we are going to declare our independence from special interests corrupt politicians and from a rigged system that benefits only the insiders, 0, 25
"We are going to declare our independence from media executives that dont care about us and politicians who dont listen to us." We are going to declare our independence from rising crime soaring poverty and crushing debt, 25, 62
We are going to declare our independence from failures of the past and create a New American Future, 62, 80
Once again we will have a government of by and for the people, 80, 93
Americanism not globalism will be our credo, 93, 100
"Its going to be America First from now on." Let me tell you what this new future looks like, 100, 119
We are going to cut taxes and create millions of new jobs, 119, 131
We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 131, 139
We are going to appoint judges who will support defend and uphold the Constitution of the United States, 139, 157
We are going to save and cherish the 2nd amendment, 157, 167
We will ensure every Veteran in this country has the right to seek medical treatment at a VA facility or with the private doctor of their choice, 167, 194
"Were going to eliminate job-killing regulations." We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution, 194, 209
"Lets talk about another issue that is important to our future and the future of our children." "Thats the issue of crime, 209, 231
Violent crime is rising across the country, 231, 238
More than 2700 have been shot in Chicago alone this year." No American should consider this level of crime acceptable, 238, 258
Every American has the right to live in safety and peace, 258, 269
A Trump Administration is going to restore law and order, 269, 279
Let me take this opportunity to thank our wonderful police and law enforcement officers, 279, 293
This state has known unbelievable heartache in recent days after the murder of 5 police officers and the wounding of another 7 in the assault on Dallas, 293, 320
We pray for the families and hope for the speedy recovery of the wounded, 320, 334
To all law enforcement in America: we are with you we support you and we will always stand with you, 334, 354
Together we will create a safe community for every citizen in the land – but especially those who have not known safety in a very very long time, 354, 382
That includes appointing an Attorney General and a Secretary of Homeland Security who are completely committed to upholding the law, 382, 402
I will appoint federal officials and investigators who will work hand-in-hand with police and citizens to dismantle gangs cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people, 402, 427
I will appoint prosecutors who will go into the most dangerous communities in America and work to liberate our citizens from violence and fear, 427, 451
All citizens deserve to be protected, 451, 457
No American left behind, 457, 461
I want every African-American parent in this country – and all parents in this country – to be able to raise their kids in safety, 461, 486
And I want to ensure every African-American child in this country – and all children in this country – are put on the American ladder of success: a good education and a good-paying job, 486, 520
We are going to have school choice charter schools and merit-pay for teachers, 520, 533
My opponent Hillary Clinton discriminates against African-American students by opposing school choice because she is owned and paid for by the education bureaucracy, 533, 556
No one owns me, 556, 560
I answer only to the American people, 560, 567
"In a New York Post column Deroy Murdock published data confirming what Ive been saying about the devastating economic conditions in the African-American communities, 567, 591
Murdock confirms these facts:" "The overall labor force participation rate for black Americans has slipped from 63.2 percent to 61.2 percent — down 3.2 percent, 591, 616
This metric also slumped for black teenagers from 29.6 percent to 27.7 percent — down 6.4 percent, 616, 633
The percentage of black Americans in poverty has grown under Obama the Census Bureau reports from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 26.2 percent in 2014 — up 1.6 percent, 633, 662
The number of blacks on Food Stamps soared under Obama — from 7.4 million in 2009 to 11.7 million in 2014 — up 58.2 percent, 662, 687
Also from Obamas arrival through last June 30 the percentage of black Americans who own homes plunged from 46.1 to 41.7 percent the Census reports — down 9.5 percent." Nearly 4 in 10 African American children live in poverty, 687, 726
58 percent of young African Americans are not employed, 726, 735
Homicide is up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C, 735, 744
and up more than 60 percent in Baltimore, 744, 752
Violent crime rose 17 percent in the fifty largest US cities, 752, 763
This is the legacy of President Obama and Hillary Clinton, 763, 773
To those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by trying something new? Let me also tell you what you have to gain: more jobs higher wages and a massive reduction in the terrible crime plaguing our inner cities, 773, 814
We are going to turn it all around, 814, 822
Success must be created for everyone and available to everyone, 822, 832
That is how we are going to create a New American Future, 832, 844
But to make every American safe and prosperous we must address one of the most vital issues of all: Border Security, 844, 865
We are going to build a wall, 865, 872
We are going to enforce the law, 872, 879
We are going to protect your jobs and wages, 879, 888
And we are going to keep our country safe, 888, 897
According to the Texas government nearly two hundred thousand illegal immigrants were booked into Texas jails between 2011 and 2016, 897, 917
Collectively those arrested were responsible for more than half a million criminal offenses including 1055 homicides 5516 sexual assault charges and more than 50000 charges of either burglary or theft, 917, 947
Yet Hillary Clinton wants a totally completely open border, 947, 956
She wants catch-and-release, 956, 959
Obamacare for illegal immigrants, 959, 963
Massive amnesty in her first 100 days, 963, 970
She wants to gut immigration enforcement, 970, 976
She supports Sanctuary Cities, 976, 980
She wants to let people overstay their visas without removal, 980, 990
One lawless order after another, 990, 995
We must not let it happen, 995, 1001
Hillary Clinton also wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees, 1001, 1011
There have been hundreds of immigrants and their children charged with terrorism inside the United States since 9/11 and a number of terrible attacks like the Boston Bombing San Bernardino and Orlando, 1011, 1043
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to fling open the floodgates even wider, 1043, 1054
"I want to create safe zones in the Middle East, 1054, 1064
My plan suspends visas when we cant perform effective screening and it puts forward a new ideological screening program to keep out people from our country who dont support our values, 1064, 1095
After all that is what taking the oath of citizenship is all about." This election will decide whether or not we have a border, 1095, 1119
This election will decide whether or not we have a country, 1119, 1130
Today I met with the moms of American children killed by illegal immigrants as a result of the policies Hillary Clinton supports, 1130, 1152
Hillary Clinton will never meet with these families she will never hear these stories, 1152, 1166
These are all forgotten Americans – they are not Hollywood or media stars or big money special interest donors, 1166, 1185
She is bought-and-paid-for by the special interests, 1185, 1192
This corruption relates closely to another corruption scandal that strikes at the heart of our Democracy, 1192, 1208
Every day more and more alarming facts come out, 1208, 1217
"The scandal I speak of is the State Departments Pay-For-Play Scandal under Hillary Clinton." If our Secretary of State can be bought or bribed or sell or trade government favors then the whole American system is threatened, 1217, 1254
"It is a threat to the foundation of Democracy itself, 1254, 1264
This is what happens in a Third World country – its the failed conditions people flee when they come to America." America can never elect a candidate who like Hillary Clinton did government favors for those giving her family and her foundation massive amounts of cash, 1264, 1310
"The new revelations about Hillary Clintons email scandal make clear we have only seen the tip of the iceberg." "Hillary Clinton is desperate to cover-up her crimes, 1310, 1337
Thats why she deleted 33000 emails, 1337, 1343
Thats also why she lied repeatedly to Congress and the American public." She said she never sent or received classified materials, 1343, 1364
That was a lie proved over and over again, 1364, 1373
She claimed she used an insecure email server for the convenience of using only one device, 1373, 1389
But she used multiple devices, 1389, 1394
Another lie, 1394, 1396
Under penalty of perjury she said she turned over all of her work-related emails, 1396, 1410
But the FBI found thousands she never turned over and now just found another 15000 more, 1410, 1426
Another Clinton lie, 1426, 1429
She said she sent nothing marked classified, 1429, 1436
A total lie unmasked to the world, 1436, 1443
And more to come, 1443, 1447
She said her server was secure and had no breaches, 1447, 1457
But we know now it was completely unsecure and the FBI Director said it could easily be hacked by our foreign enemies, 1457, 1479
More Clinton lies, 1479, 1482
Clinton said her lawyers reviewed all of her emails before destroying them, 1482, 1494
One more Hillary Clinton lie, 1494, 1499
Lie after lie after lie, 1499, 1504
Hillary Clinton is unfit to hold public office, 1504, 1512
"It is impossible to figure out where the Clinton Foundation ends and the State Department begins, 1512, 1528
It is now abundantly clear that the Clintons set up a business to profit from public office, 1528, 1545
They sold access and specific actions by and to them for money." It goes back to the Arkansas days and it continued during the White House days with the sale of the Lincoln Bedroom to large donors, 1545, 1582
But once Bill was out of office the small time Clinton business – or more accurately their crime enterprise – grew with the roles reversed, 1582, 1607
Bill now an ex-President collected the money for the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton had the public offices to sell; Senator Secretary of State and for all that time a potential President, 1607, 1639
They turned this into an exponentially larger business, 1639, 1647
But it was more than a business it was a continuing big time criminal enterprise, 1647, 1662
It involved numerous violations of the conflict of interest and bribery laws and other serious laws of the United States, 1662, 1682
The e-mails and phone logs show that the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Department of State were one and the same, 1682, 1703
If you donated to the Clinton Foundation or paid massive speaking fees to Bill Clinton you got an entry to the Department of State, 1703, 1727
Together they constituted the most scandalous and certainly most profitable sale of public office since the Teapot Dome Scandal of the 1920s, 1727, 1749
"Today a phone log was released for Cheryl Mills, 1749, 1758
She was Secretary of State Clintons Chief of Staff, 1758, 1767
You would expect the log to contain only calls concerning Department of State business, 1767, 1781
But Cheryl Mills received 148 messages between 2010 and 2012 from the Chief Operating Officer of the Clinton Foundation – no other individual or group appears to have left that many messages." We also just learned today that more than half the people who met with Hillary Clinton from outside government while she was Secretary of State were donors to the Foundation, 1781, 1843
This creates the nexus which is at the core of a RICO case, 1843, 1856
In other words they merged the two into the Clinton Family racketeering enterprise, 1856, 1869
The specific crimes committed to carry out that enterprise are too numerous to cover in this speech, 1869, 1886
I walked through two of them yesterday – the sale of U.S, 1886, 1898
Uranium to Russia and the exemption of a telecom giant from sanctions after they paid Bill Clinton for a speech, 1898, 1918
The UBS saga is another one, 1918, 1924
Shortly after Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State she went to Geneva and intervened in a dispute concerning secret identities of Americans, 1924, 1946
She negotiated a very good deal for UBS and a very bad deal for law enforcement, 1946, 1962
Of the 52000 accounts the U.S, 1962, 1968
was seeking the government settled for only 4450 accounts, 1968, 1977
Her intervention was described by Treasury as unusual, 1977, 1985
Before her unusual intervention UBS had donated only $60000 to the Foundation, 1985, 1997
After the Clinton favor for UBS it opened its wallet for big bucks and out came a $600000 contribution a $32 million loan and a $1.5 million speaking fee for Bill Clinton, 1997, 2029
This is corruption pure and simple, 2029, 2035
This is why I have called for a special prosecutor, 2035, 2045
"Justice is supposed to be blind, 2045, 2051
Its never supposed to be for sale." In the long-run there is only one way to end the corruption in our country: elect Donald J, 2051, 2076
Trump, 2076, 2077
Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the law, 2077, 2085
Come November the American people will show her that she is not, 2085, 2097
You will be voting for justice fairness and equality, 2097, 2106
You will also be voting for a more inclusive country where no one is left out, 2106, 2122
Another 2 million Latinos have joined the ranks of those in poverty, 2122, 2134
Incomes for Latino households have declined by nearly $1000 under President Obama, 2134, 2146
The number of Latino children living in poverty increased by 15 percent, 2146, 2158
Our pro-growth pro-jobs pro-family agenda is going to bring hope back to every community in our nation, 2158, 2175
I will dedicate myself to restore the ladder of success to all those who live in poverty, 2175, 2192
We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future, 2192, 2216
The era of division is coming to end, 2216, 2224
We will create a new future of American unity, 2224, 2233
Are you ready for real American change? It is time to emphasize what we all have in common as Americans, 2233, 2253
We will promote our common culture values and principles, 2253, 2262
We will be one nation, 2262, 2267
We will be one people, 2267, 2272
We will share together one great future, 2272, 2279
"Its going to be America First." Together we will make America proud again, 2279, 2292
We will make America prosperous again, 2292, 2298
We will make America safe again, 2298, 2304
Friends citizens and fellow Americans: We will make America great again, 2304, 2315
