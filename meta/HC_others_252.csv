"Donald Trump recently discovered a new love for Americas veterans promising that a Trump administration will treat them really really well, 0, 21
Yet after a publicity stunt earlier this year when he ditched a GOP debate to hold an event on behalf of veterans his campaign  more than half of the $6 million dollars it allegedly raised, 21, 56
They  where that money has gone, 56, 62
And worse this is part of a long pattern of the real Donald J, 62, 76
Trump who for over a decade tried to get disabled veterans legally operating as street vendors thrown off of Fifth Avenue in New York City, 76, 101
He  that these Americans who were simply trying to earn a living in the country they gave so much to defend were clogging and seriously downgrading the area." "And yet even as Donald Trump denigrates our nations current veterans hes putting our future veterans at risk with a risky and incoherent foreign policy, 101, 154
  and  national security professionals agree that a Trump administration would make America dangerously less safe while reducing its standing and influence in the world, 154, 178
His embrace of both military adventurism and isolationism and his support of the use of torture will not only recklessly place our troops in harms way but will dramatically increase the risk to our service members serving in operations overseas, 178, 218
Trumps policies are detrimental to the young men and women who volunteer to serve this country from the moment they join the armed services to the end of their career civilian or military, 218, 251
He cant be trusted by our veterans or anyone else." "Its time for Donald Trump to stop using vets as political props donate the rest of the money he raised and build a real understanding of the needs and concerns of the men and women who have served America."
