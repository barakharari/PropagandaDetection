"The mothers of Trayvon Martin Eric Garner Sandra Bland Dontre Hamilton and Jordan Davis share what its like fight for justice alongside one another." I have joined together with several other mothers who have lost children, 0, 36
We are the Mothers of the Movement, 36, 43
We have decided that we are going to band together and were going to tell the world our personal stories, 43, 63
This movement is about getting up and moving! Its about changing whats going on in our criminal justice system whats going on with policing in our communities, 63, 90
I know this is what I need to be doing because there are many people who are so angry with the state of whats going on in the world that theyre not going to vote, 90, 125
So I can get out there and say "Hey Im still standing, 125, 137
Even in the midst of all this grief I can get up and move so you can too." Thats why we say were Mothers of the Movement, 137, 164
We are moving, 164, 167
Were not parked we are going, 167, 173
Thats it, 173, 175
"You know when youre a mom and youre grieving and youre missing your child even after youre done with the crying you still have to go home and deal with your regular life which is hard, 175, 211
And so when we get together it is one of the most powerful things you ever can imagine, 211, 229
We catch up and we hear whats going on with the legislature in each persons state, 229, 245
And we try to have fun, 245, 251
We try to at least laugh, 251, 257
Because there is a lot of crying sometimes, 257, 265
We keep tissue available, 265, 269
We will talk about our kids of course but we also talk about all the things that are going on in the world, 269, 292
And now with all of us endorsing Hillary were in this movement to get her in there, 292, 309
We dont care what we have to do were going to do it." Well first of all I wasnt even going to go to that meeting, 309, 335
It was one of those days where I woke up and it was a bad day, 335, 351
I was having a "Sandy day" all day, 351, 359
I was crying and I said "Im not going ok?" And then my daughter said "What do you mean youre not going? Oh no were going." So I get there and all the other moms are there and its like this big reunion, 359, 402
We just hugged each other, 402, 407
Might not have said a word but we just hugged each other and you could feel that energy, 407, 425
Then Hillary Clinton comes in she sits down, 425, 433
And immediately it was like shes at our kitchen table, 433, 443
There was this overwhelming sense that this is family, 443, 452
She said "Im honored to be here with you guys, 452, 462
Tell me about your daughter your son." And we were like "My God." She took her time and listened to each one of us around the table, 462, 489
And then around the end of the meeting she said "You guys really need to unify." And thats what we did, 489, 510
Then she said "I will be getting back with you." And to talk with all the ladies and find out thats literally what she did—you cant fake that, 510, 538
Thats not phony, 538, 541
Were just rolling with Hillary, 541, 546
Period, 546, 547
Well I guess you can call me an unwilling participant, 547, 557
I dont think any of the mothers that I come to the table with want to be on that side of the table, 557, 580
I would not have signed up for this I would not have trained for this, 580, 595
This is something that happens in your life and you feel like "I have to do something about it, 595, 614
I cant just continue to be broken, 614, 621
I must do my part." And so this is me doing my part not only for my son whos in heaven but for my son whos here on earth too, 621, 651
Ill always have two boys, 651, 656
But I will continue to do the work to try to fight against senseless gun violence, 656, 672
I will try to do what I can and Im dedicated to this fight, 672, 686
I cant help Trayvon at this time, 686, 693
But there are other Trayvon Martins who I can help, 693, 703
And working with these mothers is one way I can do that, 703, 715
It was a very heartfelt meeting, 715, 721
It was supposed to be pretty short in the beginning but because of the topics and the tragedies and the things that were being discussed Secretary Clinton wanted to hear more, 721, 752
The meeting was very productive on our end as mothers, 752, 762
But it was also an eye opener for Secretary Clinton because now not only did she hear about these tragedies in the news and on social media and from her staffers she heard first-hand from the mothers, 762, 799
And shes a mother, 799, 803
Shes a grandmother, 803, 806
Shes a wife, 806, 809
Shes a woman, 809, 812
She related to us at a time when nobody else would listen, 812, 824
She made no promises about "Ill do this and Ill do that if Im elected." What she did commit to do was put every effort into making sure that this does not happen to anybody elses kid, 824, 861
She wanted to make sure that she put the proper laws and policies in place to try to make a difference, 861, 882
And that was important to us as mothers, 882, 890
"We are having a crisis in the United States, 890, 899
Hillary Clinton has stepped out and is discussing this because she knows it is a huge problem in our community, 899, 919
She addressed the issue—and that meant a lot to us, 919, 929
Her experience and her leadership speaks for itself, 929, 937
Her information and how she deals with equality for women for minorities—it speaks for itself, 937, 952
I tell everybody to make sure theyre taking a look at the track record of some of these candidates and to make sure theyre not just talking the talk, 952, 981
That they have put the work in, 981, 988
Hillary Clinton has put the work in." Its camaraderie, 988, 997
Just a sense—I kind of hate to say it—but a sense of belonging, 997, 1010
Because for us we are our own circle of mothers, 1010, 1020
Its very difficult to express what we feel and what we think to people who havent experienced what weve experienced, 1020, 1040
People claim "Oh I know how you feel." No you dont know, 1040, 1052
And so to be able to lean on each other and to support each other and to nurture each other is so rewarding, 1052, 1075
And as we go forward it may seem like were very strong—but at the core were still pretty weak because you never get over this, 1075, 1100
I mean this is every day of our lives, 1100, 1109
And so to be in the company of other women—black women—who understand what Im bearing because theyre bearing the same thing its comforting, 1109, 1132
Its so comforting to be embraced by other women who really really share your pain, 1132, 1147
It was very powerful, 1147, 1151
There was just this sense of awe because Ive been watching the cases on television and Ive been watching the women and Ive been listening to their stories and listening to the news, 1151, 1184
But to actually be in the same company of women who have been so morally injured by the same gun violence the same implicit bias that was just .., 1184, 1213
I looked at Cleo Pendleton and I said to her "You know what? Im so glad were together but its just so painful why we have to be at this meeting with Secretary Clinton, 1213, 1247
We shouldnt have to be here for these reasons." But it was empowering because during that meeting Secretary Clinton told us "I need you the mothers to mobilize and move forward in this movement." And before that nobody else had really given us permission to really begin to challenge those things that weve suffered, 1247, 1301
Wed just taken permission and decided ourselves to do it, 1301, 1311
But to have someone of the stature of Secretary Clinton back us up and support us and ask us to help champion as well and to know that shes championing for us and our communities that was huge, 1311, 1349
It was monumental to me, 1349, 1354
"These are moments that are once-in-a-lifetime, 1354, 1360
Shes going to be the first female president of the United States and shes going to be able to help usher in change through everything that President Obama has already put in place, 1360, 1393
So to be a part of that history even this little small part that I get to play is such a tremendous blessing, 1393, 1416
So then it makes me know that Jordan and all of our children didnt die in vain, 1416, 1433
That were just all a bigger part of Gods greater plan, 1433, 1444
And so to be able to be a part of that whether she wins or not Im grateful." n "Through Mothers for Justice I provide support to families who are victims of stolen life, 1444, 1478
I call them stolen lives—I dont call them victims because theyre not victims, 1478, 1491
The victims are those who are left in the wake of that stolen life and thats who I help, 1491, 1510
I get phone calls at three four in the morning from moms who just cant deal, 1510, 1526
And I know how they feel, 1526, 1532
I know their lives will never be the same, 1532, 1541
So we nurture we grieve together we depend on each other, 1541, 1552
And thats what we get our comfort from, 1552, 1560
Our joy comes from God." "I enjoy being around my sisters, 1560, 1571
Its been educational, 1571, 1574
Its empowering and its been a spiritual journey, 1574, 1582
We laugh, 1582, 1584
We cry, 1584, 1586
We hold each other up in times of need, 1586, 1595
We depend on each other for answers, 1595, 1602
We are companions and were supportive of each others efforts, 1602, 1612
All of us have our connections with the Lord and what were doing in this movement and its phenomenal, 1612, 1631
And we keep our children right in the midst of everything we do, 1631, 1644
We say that our sons are seeds, 1644, 1651
I feel as though me and my family have been chosen to be a part of this movement because of our faith and Gods mercy and his grace, 1651, 1679
And a lot of the other victims of stolen lives feel the presence of those lives as well, 1679, 1697
This is my lifes work—to get justice for my son and for those coming." "Because I believe Hillary Clinton will make the best president, 1697, 1721
I chose Hillary because of her record because of her caring spirit and because shes a listener and shes been involved since we got together, 1721, 1746
After we first met she made my struggle for justice her business and her affair, 1746, 1761
I had a meeting with Hillary at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 1761, 1772
I spoke with her for about five minutes, 1772, 1780
She told me that she was a mother and a grandmother, 1780, 1791
She was very compassionate, 1791, 1795
She told me how sorry she was and that she was going to build her policy in a way that allowed her to do everything in her power to stop things like what happened to us from ever happening again, 1795, 1835
And right then and there during the meeting I knew that I was going to endorse her, 1835, 1852
I knew that some point in my near future I would be partnering up with her, 1852, 1868
I didnt know it would be to this extent but I am able to move forward because of her efforts, 1868, 1888
I appreciate that, 1888, 1891
Thats why Im here." "My son no longer has a voice but his mother does, 1891, 1906
Im going to get out there and Im going to speak out, 1906, 1918
Im going to walk Im going to rally—whatever it takes—until my voice is heard until we get justice, 1918, 1936
As a people we have to take a stand, 1936, 1945
And I have to take a stand for my son as well as for the people who experienced this but no one knows their stories, 1945, 1970
Or they were in the news for one day and never talked about again, 1970, 1984
Im going to be the voice of the voiceless and the nameless, 1984, 1996
Im going to speak out—not only for Eric but for all the other mothers sisters brothers uncles and aunts out there, 1996, 2017
We have to make the world aware of what they are doing to our young men, 2017, 2033
And if we dont stop it its going to continue." There were 12 of us mothers in that meeting, 2033, 2052
Hillary asked each of us to share our stories and everyones child had died of gun violence—except for my child, 2052, 2072
So when it became my turn she said before I even spoke "Well I know Ms, 2072, 2088
Carr your son didnt die from gun violence." I said "Youre right he was choked to death." She said "Theres something we have to do about that too." She took that into consideration that no matter how your son died it was still violence, 2088, 2132
And this is what we need our officials to recognize—our hurt and our pain no matter how it came, 2132, 2151
It was really impressive to me because she was clearly concerned about my situation, 2151, 2165
"The sermon was all about stepping outside of the box and for me that was a very powerful message, 2165, 2184
Because I sometimes say the same things to people about stepping outside the box, 2184, 2198
The box is repetitious, 2198, 2202
You do the same thing over and over and keep getting the same results which most of the time are not positive, 2202, 2224
When you step outside the box you dont know what youre going to get but youre taking a leap of faith, 2224, 2245
A lot of times when you go on faith you can get more things done more things will materialize, 2245, 2264
Sometimes you dont even know how they happen but they happen, 2264, 2275
And I step out the box a lot of times, 2275, 2285
This movement for my son—this is outside the box for me, 2285, 2296
I never thought that Id be doing this, 2296, 2304
I never thought Id be in South Carolina, 2304, 2312
I never thought Id be in Florida in California, 2312, 2321
But Ive been all these places and thats outside the box for me." , 2321, 2334
