"Thank you, 0, 2
Its wonderful to be here in Pennsylvania." Great polls keep coming in, 2, 14
A brand new Rasmussen poll has us up 5 points nationwide, 14, 25
On November 8th we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House, 25, 44
We are going to replace our failed and corrupt establishment with a new government that serves you your family and your country, 44, 66
At the center of our society is going to be a simple promise to every American: safety, 66, 83
We are going to Make America Safe Again, 83, 91
The rioting in our streets is a threat to all peaceful citizens, 91, 103
It must be ended, 103, 107
The main victims of these violent demonstrations are law-abiding African-Americans who live in these communities and only want to raise their children in peace, 107, 131
Who is looking out for them? For every one violent disruptor there are thousands of moms and dads in those same communities who just want their kids to be able to walk home safely from school, 131, 167
"To all our citizens in all of our inner cities and all across the country I say these words to you tonight: Im with you and I will fight for you." "The job of a leader is to stand in someone elses shoes and see things from their perspective, 167, 216
Hillary Clinton calls people who dont support her deplorable and irredeemable, 216, 227
I call anyone who doesnt support me an American citizen who is entitled to equal representation under the law." I will be a President for all Americans and I will campaign for every last vote in every last community, 227, 266
I will extend my hand to every mayor in this country who wants to be a partner in making our cities safer for their citizens, 266, 291
But to do this we must work with our police – not against our police, 291, 306
Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest that is afflicting our country and hurting those who have the very least, 306, 351
Low-income African-Americans in these communities are the ones suffering in terms of lost jobs lost property values and lost lives, 351, 371
65 people have been shot in the city of Chicago alone since Friday, 371, 384
The problem is not that there are too many police, 384, 394
The problem is that there are not enough police, 394, 403
Police are entrusted with immense responsibility and we must do everything we can to ensure they are properly trained that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always vigorously addressed, 403, 438
But our men and women in blue also need our support our thanks and our gratitude, 438, 454
They are the line separating civilization from chaos, 454, 462
"Hillary Clinton does not have to worry about the sirens and the gunshots at night, 462, 477
No its the poor family living in the inner city – its the mother who feels like a refugee in her own country." Who is there to represent these families? "Hillary Clinton doesnt want to hear their voices, 477, 515
So I will be their voice and I will be a voice for all of the forgotten Americans in this country, 515, 536
People who just want a secure community for their families good schools for the kids and a good-paying job to support their loved ones." We will bring security to our African-American communities and to our Latino communities, 536, 573
We will also bring school choice and new prosperity, 573, 582
"Democrats have run our inner cities for more than half a century, 582, 594
Its time for change – its time for a New American Future." My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 594, 621
My opponent likes to say that for decades she has been "fighting for women." That she has been "fighting for children." Why then are 70 million American women and children living in poverty or on the brink of poverty? Why has she provided no relief for the millions of Americans in search of affordable reliable quality childcare? You know the old saying "Watch what I do not what I say." At the Trump Organization and in my campaign for President women occupy some of the highest positions, 621, 708
I have employed thousands of women in my company, 708, 717
Women of different backgrounds, 717, 721
Women of many talents, 721, 725
And just last week here in Pennsylvania I was joined by my daughter Ivanka and I laid out my plan for childcare and eldercare, 725, 749
We have also talked about improving education and I will talk about it more tonight, 749, 764
A first-class public school education as well as options for alternatives through charter schools school choice and homeschooling is a right not a privilege, 764, 788
The opportunity to attend a two or four-year college or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education should be easier to access pay for and finish, 788, 820
Education is the bedrock of our society, 820, 827
Women also value security, 827, 831
They want a Commander-in-Chief that will defeat radical Islamic terrorism and protect our borders, 831, 845
As I campaign across this country I hear so many stories and pleas from women especially about drug addiction and opioid use, 845, 867
They are doing their best in their communities and for their families to provide a safe and nurturing environment, 867, 886
But even the best-laid plans cannot always protect our youth and increasingly many adults from the scourge of drugs, 886, 905
We lose thousands of our fellow Americans every year to opioid use, 905, 917
I will stop the drug inflow from our borders, 917, 926
These drugs come over the border and make their way into our urban and rural communities and into our suburbs, 926, 946
This must change, 946, 949
Every change starts with a conversation, 949, 955
Together we will have this conversation, 955, 961
And we will make this change, 961, 967
The changes will start immediately, 967, 972
On my first day in office I am going to immediately begin lifting all regulations that are hurting our workers and our businesses, 972, 995
This will unleash a technology revolution, 995, 1001
America will become the best place to innovate and to invest in the future, 1001, 1015
The next great American invention the next great improvement to our lives is right around the corner, 1015, 1032
All we have to do is remove the red tape, 1032, 1042
"Our plan includes one of the biggest tax reforms in American history, 1042, 1054
Its going to include a 15% tax rate for all businesses small and large making our country a magnet for new jobs." We are going to unleash an American Energy Revolution, 1054, 1085
Oil coal natural gas shale energy and renewables, 1085, 1093
This will add at least half a million new jobs every single year, 1093, 1106
But to be a prosperous nation we need to be a country that makes and builds things in our own country, 1106, 1127
That is why I will direct the Department of Commerce to identify every single violation of our trading rules by our foreign competitors, 1127, 1150
We will apply every lawful remedy to end these trade abuses, 1150, 1161
Steel jobs and all manufacturing jobs will be returning to Pennsylvania in a very big way, 1161, 1177
Your state has lost one-third of your manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and one-fourth of your manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade Organization, 1177, 1201
These were both Bill Clinton deals backed by Hillary Clinton, 1201, 1211
The Clintons robbed Pennsylvania stole your jobs and shipped them to other countries – we are going to bring them back, 1211, 1232
Jobs will come flowing back in all over America, 1232, 1241
"It used to be that cars were made in Flint and you couldnt drink the water in Mexico, 1241, 1259
Today the cars are made in Mexico and you cant drink the water in Flint." "Were going to turn it all around." "Theres a reason the hedge fund managers are all donating to Hillary Clintons campaign – and not mine, 1259, 1299
Everybody getting rich off the rigged system and who wants nothing to change are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton." My campaign is powered by my own money and by small dollar donations from everyday patriotic citizens, 1299, 1336
95% of our donors are small dollar donations, 1336, 1344
Every dollar helps us deliver your country back to you – visit DonaldJTrump.com to find out how you can help our movement, 1344, 1366
"Let me tell you what else were going to do." One of the biggest problems facing young people and families today is the cost of college education, 1366, 1393
The cost of college has increased by over 500% since 1973, 1393, 1404
"But what a lot of people dont know is that universities get massive tax breaks for their massive endowments, 1404, 1423
These huge multi-billion dollar endowments are tax-free but too many of these universities dont use the money to help with tuition and student debt." "Instead these universities use the money to pay their administrators or put donors names on buildings or just store the money away, 1423, 1469
In fact many universities spend more on private equity fund managers than tuition programs." But they should be using the money on the students – for tuition for student life and for student housing, 1469, 1503
On top of that the federal government spends over $70 billion in higher education every year plus another $130 billion on federal loans, 1503, 1526
"Here again the universities dont use the money to reduce the price of college – but to increase it." "We have to break this cycle, 1526, 1551
Im going to work with Congress on reforms to make sure that if universities want access to all of these special federal tax breaks and tax dollars – paid for by you – that they are making a good faith effort to reduce the cost of college and student debt and to spend their endowments on their own students." Another major issue for all American families is healthcare, 1551, 1619
President Obama promised Obamacare would reduce the cost of healthcare by $2500 dollars, 1619, 1632
Instead the opposite happened – the cost of healthcare has increased nearly $5000 dollars during that time, 1632, 1649
Just one more Washington lie – like the lie that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, 1649, 1669
"Its a disaster." That is why on my first day I am going to ask Congress to immediately send me a bill to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, 1669, 1697
We are going to replace government-run Obamacare with reforms that put patients first, 1697, 1710
These reforms include expanding access to popular Healthcare Savings Accounts empowering Americans to shop for the insurance of their choice across state lines and block granting Medicaid to the states so they can design innovative solutions to best serve our most vulnerable citizens, 1710, 1753
Hillary Clinton on the other hand wants to give Obamacare to illegal immigrants and wants a total government takeover of healthcare, 1753, 1774
Her plan also gives Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants by making them citizens – bankrupting these programs for Americans, 1774, 1795
"She doesnt understand how Democracy works, 1795, 1801
Public servants are just that – theyre there to serve you, 1801, 1812
But the only people Hillary Clinton has ever served are the special interests." "Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C, 1812, 1837
Were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives." "Theyre all part of the same political establishment, 1837, 1862
They go to the same restaurants they attend the same conferences they have the same friends and connections, 1862, 1880
They all support the same ideology of globalism that makes them rich while shipping your jobs your factories and your wealth to other countries." I am not running to be President of the World, 1880, 1914
I am running to be President of the United States, 1914, 1924
I Am For America – and America First, 1924, 1932
Together we will rebuild this country beyond our greatest dreams, 1932, 1942
Government will start working again, 1942, 1947
Fixing things is what I do, 1947, 1953
Just look at my projects in New York where I turned rundown spaces into new centers of business activity and opportunity – where others saw only problems I saw only potential, 1953, 1984
We turned empty lots into homes offices and living memories for thousands of workers and families, 1984, 2000
"Thats what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods the failing schools the forgotten stretches of this nation and unlock their potential for all of our people." "Ive made a living for years looking at unused spaces and imagining what they could be, 2000, 2052
Politicians look at blighted neighborhoods and offer only excuses – I look at those same neighborhoods and offer solutions." "We spend so much time thinking about how things used to be weve stopped thinking about how great things could be – all we have to do is tune out the doubters the cynics and the naysayers." "We are a nation of strivers dreamers and believers – and thats the spirit that will carry us to victory in November and to great victories as a nation." "Its that same spirit of resilience I have seen visiting the flood-ravaged towns in Louisiana or meeting with the incredible but hard-hit people in cities and towns like Flint Michigan." "Its that spirit of strength we will need to start winning again as a country." But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th, 2052, 2195
You have to knock on doors, 2195, 2201
You have to pick up that phone, 2201, 2208
Go to our website to learn more, 2208, 2215
You have to campaign on the streets, 2215, 2222
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country, 2222, 2237
To beat the system you have to lift your voice pound the pavement and get out the vote, 2237, 2255
You have 46 days to change the world, 2255, 2263
You have 46 days to make possible every dream you ever dreamed of for your country, 2263, 2279
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation, 2279, 2297
The arrogance of Washington D.C, 2297, 2302
will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 2302, 2316
This November 8th we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before, 2316, 2340
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; unleash American energy; appoint justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold the Constitution of the United States; close our border to terrorists save the 2nd amendment; and put American workers first, 2340, 2396
We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 2396, 2408
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 2408, 2428
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 2428, 2437
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation, 2437, 2455
American workers will be hired to do the job, 2455, 2464
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 2464, 2476
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People, 2476, 2500
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 2500, 2521
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 2521, 2543
Jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing onto our shores, 2543, 2558
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 2558, 2571
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 2571, 2577
We Will Make America Strong Again, 2577, 2583
We Will Make America Safe Again, 2583, 2589
And We Will Make America Great Again, 2589, 2596
Thank you and God Bless! , 2596, 2601
