Senior United States District Judge Robert E, 0, 7
Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued – in line with overwhelming public opinion – that RNC delegates must follow election results and that delegates cannot be stolen at the national convention, 7, 44
Delegate Beau Correll Jr, 44, 48
had brought the suit against the Commonwealth of Virginia hoping to reject the will of the voters but was soundly defeated, 48, 69
Specifically the Court found that RNC Rule 16 which binds delegates based on their election results "is in effect presently and that it controls the allocation and binding of delegates as to their voting at convention." (p, 69, 106
6) The Court held that the Plaintiffs "expert testimony" from Erling Curly Haugland was not credible lacked "textual support" (p.6) and that "delegates are bound by RNC Rule 16." (p, 106, 136
7) Further the Court found that by signing the "Declaration and Statement of Qualification" RNC delegates are bound by RNC Rule 16(c)(2) (p, 136, 159
10) and that this Declaration obligated Correll to vote in accordance with Republican Party rules and Virginias election results, 159, 178
(p, 178, 179
46) Trump Campaign Attorney and former FEC Chairman Don McGahn issued the following statement: "The court has confirmed what we have said all along: Rule 16 is in effect and thus delegates including Correll are bound to vote in accordance with the election results, 179, 223
The court did not buy what Curly Haugland was selling and noted that his testimony has no support in the rules text and was contradicted by his own book Unbound, 223, 253
This case puts his unbound theory to rest and is a fatal blow to the Anti-Trump agitators." , 253, 270
