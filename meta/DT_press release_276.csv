Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama released the following statement regarding Mr, 0, 11
Trumps achievement of exceeding the 1237 delegates needed to clench the Republican nomination:" "I congratulate Donald Trump for his primary victory against a field of seventeen formidable candidates, 11, 39
His message resonated with millions of Republicans and new voters he brought into the Party, 39, 54
The American people made their voices loud and clear, 54, 63
They do not want more of the same, 63, 71
Yet as we move to the general election more of the same is exactly what Hillary Clinton offers, 71, 89
More failed trade deals more failed foreign adventures more lawlessness in our immigration system, 89, 103
Donald Trump on the other hand stood against powerful forces and the conventional thinking of a comfortable establishment to boldly declare that our country is on the wrong track that current policies are not working and that prosperity is steadily slipping away from the American people, 103, 149
His message of hope and prosperity has captured the imagination of millions of Republicans Democrats and Independents, 149, 166
His vision provides an historic opportunity to unify our people and break through old battle lines to enable the greatness of America to arise again, 166, 191
Donald Trump cares that working Americans are hurting he understands the policy errors that have caused it to happen and importantly he is determined to use all his strength and skill to get us on the right track again, 191, 230
"There is so much that must be done â€“ and done before its too late, 230, 245
Donald Trump will only negotiate trade deals that benefit America, 245, 255
He will execute a wise realistic foreign policy that brings peace through strength, 255, 268
He will finally respect and respond to the American peoples demand for a lawful immigration system that serves Americas interests, 268, 288
He will nominate judges of great ability who know they serve under the laws and Constitution and are not above them, 288, 309
He will sign legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare not veto it, 309, 321
He will produce a tax code that is fair to all and promotes jobs and better wages, 321, 338
He will stop wasteful Washington spending and restore fiscal sanity." "The choice could not be clearer, 338, 354
A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for a failed status quo that for too long has put the special interests ahead of the peoples interests, 354, 381
A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for American security sovereignty and prosperity." In the coming months I look forward to working with Mr, 381, 406
Trump and his millions of supporters to make America great again." , 406, 417
