"Today Id like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election." People have asked me why I am running for President, 0, 23
I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day, 23, 43
We come to work together and turn visions into reality, 43, 53
We think big and then we make it happen, 53, 62
I love what I do and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it, 62, 83
So when people ask me why I am running I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me, 83, 111
When I see the crumbling roads and bridges or the dilapidated airports or the factories moving overseas to Mexico or to other countries I know these problems can all be fixed but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me, 111, 151
The fact is we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs jobs jobs! "Everywhere I look I see the possibilities of what our country could be, 151, 182
But we cant solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them." We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place, 182, 221
The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money, 221, 238
"Thats why were asking Bernie Sanders voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans, 238, 259
Importantly this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals." "Because its not just the political system thats rigged, 259, 279
Its the whole economy." "Its rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages." "Its rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country fire our workers and sell their products back into the U.S, 279, 316
with absolutely no consequences for them." "Its rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools." "Its rigged against you the American people." Hillary Clinton who as most people know is a world class liar – just look at her pathetic email and server statements or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers a total self-serving lie, 316, 391
"Brian Williams career was destroyed for saying far less." Yesterday she even tried to attack me and my many businesses, 391, 411
But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York not so long ago with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars, 411, 441
I have always had a talent for building businesses and importantly creating jobs, 441, 454
That is a talent our country desperately needs, 454, 462
I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you the American worker first, 462, 479
We are going to put America First and we are going to Make America Great again, 479, 495
This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people or by the politicians, 495, 510
Here is my promise to the American voter: If I am elected President I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C, 510, 533
The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests, 533, 556
Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft, 556, 567
She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes and many others in exchange for cash, 567, 591
Then when she left she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public, 591, 628
Together she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists CEOs and foreign governments in the years since 2001, 628, 648
They totally own her and that will never change, 648, 657
The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control, 657, 687
Those are the stakes, 687, 691
"Hillary Clinton wants to be President, 691, 697
But she doesnt have the temperament or as Bernie Sanders said the judgement to be president." She believes she is entitled to the office, 697, 721
Her campaign slogan is "Im with her." "You know what my response to that is? Im with you: the American people." "She thinks its all about her." "I know its all about you – I know its all about making America Great Again for All Americans." Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first, 721, 780
"We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on whats good for Americas middle class – to a policy of globalism focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy." We reward companies for offshoring and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed, 780, 856
This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats, 856, 866
This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs, 866, 881
We need to reform our economic system so that once again we can all succeed together and America can become rich again, 881, 903
"Thats what we mean by America First." Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores, 903, 934
Our Founders understood this, 934, 938
One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for "the encouragement and protection of manufacturing" in America, 938, 958
Our first Republican President Abraham Lincoln warned us by saying: "The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people." I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton, 958, 1009
"Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clintons disastrous NAFTA just like she supported Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization." "Weve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed." "Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clintons time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated but rather scorned." Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day, 1009, 1094
Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs and effectively let China completely rebuild itself, 1094, 1110
In return Hillary Clinton got rich! "The book Clinton Cash by Peter Schweitzer documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at Americas expense." She gets rich making you poor, 1110, 1145
Here is a quote from the book: "At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters." These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States, 1145, 1207
She sold out our workers and our country for Beijing, 1207, 1217
Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission, 1217, 1249
Now because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal she is pretending that she is against it, 1249, 1271
She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30000 emails are missing.) "But this latest Clinton cover-up doesnt change anything: if she is elected president she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good, 1271, 1331
She will do this just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons NAFTA deal." I want trade deals but they have to be great for the United States and our workers, 1331, 1381
"We dont make great deals anymore but we will once I become president." "Its not just our economy thats been corrupted but our foreign policy too." The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world, 1381, 1429
No Secretary of State has been more wrong more often and in more places than Hillary Clinton, 1429, 1446
Her decisions spread death destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched, 1446, 1456
"Among the victims is our late Ambassador Chris Stevens, 1456, 1465
He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- thats right when the phone rang at 3 oclock in the morning she was sleeping." Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security, 1465, 1508
"Hillary Clintons State Department refused them all." She started the war that put him in Libya denied him the security he asked for then left him there to die, 1508, 1537
To cover her tracks Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death, 1537, 1552
"Here is what one of the victims mothers had to say:" "I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face and you dont want this person to be president." In 2009 before Hillary Clinton was sworn in it was a different world, 1552, 1598
Libya was cooperating, 1598, 1601
Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, 1601, 1608
Syria was under control, 1608, 1612
Iran was being choked by sanctions, 1612, 1618
Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel, 1618, 1632
"ISIS wasnt even on the map." Fast forward to 2013: In just four years Secretary Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East, 1632, 1657
Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians, 1657, 1669
Thanks to Hillary Clinton Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons, 1669, 1691
"Hillary Clintons support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West." "She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood, 1691, 1744
The Egyptian military has retaken control but Clinton has opened the Pandoras box of radical Islam." Then there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers, 1744, 1783
ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made, 1783, 1795
ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East and peaceful Muslims across the world who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety, 1795, 1831
"In short Hillary Clintons tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another." It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place, 1831, 1865
Though I was not in government service I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war and yes even before the war ever started, 1865, 1891
"But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq because when she got into power she couldnt wait to rush us off to war in Libya." She lacks the temperament the judgment and the competence to lead, 1891, 1926
In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office: "She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasnt changed a bit." "Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clintons foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam." "In fact Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States and thats an increase over President Obamas already very high number." Under her plan we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe, 1926, 2060
Already hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S, 2060, 2077
The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth, 2077, 2100
I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people, 2100, 2114
Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death, 2114, 2132
Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department, 2132, 2152
Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency, 2152, 2165
Here is some more of what we learned from the book Clinton Cash: To cover-up her corrupt dealings Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server, 2165, 2195
Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger, 2195, 2220
Then there are the 33000 emails she deleted, 2220, 2228
While we may not know what is in those deleted emails our enemies probably do, 2228, 2243
So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States, 2243, 2262
This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency, 2262, 2270
"We cant hand over our government to someone whose deepest darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies." National security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither, 2270, 2301
Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States, 2301, 2318
She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders in the United States, 2318, 2346
The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs, 2346, 2363
They are the ones she will hurt the most, 2363, 2372
Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza, 2372, 2386
She lost her amazing son Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton, 2386, 2413
Sadly the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate, 2413, 2428
"Here is an excerpt from Mrs, 2428, 2434
Mendozas letter:" "Hillary Clinton who already has the blood of so many on her hands is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country, 2434, 2481
Hillary is not concerned about you or I she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her, 2481, 2502
She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country." Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States on top of the current record level of immigration, 2502, 2546
For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees we could rebuild every inner city in America, 2546, 2567
"Hillarys Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor and unemployed Americans out of work, 2567, 2583
She cant claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them." Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days: There is one common theme in all of these reforms, 2583, 2635
"Its going to be America First." This is why the stakes in November are so great, 2635, 2651
On Election Day the politicians stand trial before the people, 2651, 2661
"The voters are the jury, 2661, 2666
Their ballots are the verdict, 2666, 2671
We dont need or want another Clinton or Obama." Come November the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security betrayed their prosperity and sold out their country, 2671, 2709
They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people, 2709, 2732
"Hillary Clintons message is old and tired, 2732, 2739
Her message is that cant change." My message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it, 2739, 2762
This is our last chance to do it, 2762, 2770
Americans are the people that tamed the West that dug out the Panama Canal that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams and so much more, 2770, 2800
Then we started thinking small, 2800, 2805
We stopped believing in what America could do and became reliant on other countries other people and other institutions, 2805, 2824
We lost our sense of purpose and daring, 2824, 2832
"But thats not who we are." Come this November we can bring America back – bigger and better and stronger than ever, 2832, 2854
We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow, 2854, 2873
Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way, 2873, 2892
Massive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities, 2892, 2909
Inner cities which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party will finally be rebuilt, 2909, 2927
Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better, 2927, 2937
"The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up along with the new jobs, 2937, 2963
Hillarys massive taxation regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone." We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do, 2963, 3001
I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices, 3001, 3011
Our country is going to start working again, 3011, 3019
People are going to start working again, 3019, 3026
Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities, 3026, 3044
Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country, 3044, 3056
We are going to make America rich again, 3056, 3064
We are going to make America safe again, 3064, 3072
We are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE, 3072, 3086
