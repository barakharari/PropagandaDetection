Time for some delegate math, 0, 5
On Saturday Hillary Clinton won the caucus in a tiny U.S, 5, 16
territory many Americans have never heard of: the Northern Mariana Islands, 16, 27
The Pacific island group had just 189 caucus-goers—but it matters more than you think, 27, 41
"Because at the end of the day the Democratic primary is a race for delegates, 41, 56
When voters and caucus-goers head to the polls theyre actually pledging delegates to a candidate, 56, 71
And the candidate with the majority of delegates wins the nomination." And sometimes fighting for every delegate takes a little creativity as   reports: Before Saturday Hillary led Bernie Sanders by 221 delegates—and more than 1.6 million votes, 71, 108
Her win in the Northern Marianas put her ahead by two more delegates—coincidentally the same number of delegates she gained by winning Iowa, 108, 131
Between her victories in the Northern Marianas and her Super Tuesday win in another small territory American Samoa Hillary gained four delegates—the same number Bernie Sanders picked up in Michigan, 131, 161
"And Hillarys delegate lead will be harder and harder to close as the race goes on." "Thats why Hillary and the team are out there working for every last vote and delegate—in every last state and territory big or small." , 161, 201
