"Thank you! Whoa! Thank you so much, 0, 7
And I am so happy to be here in Coral Springs in Broward County in the great state of Florida! And I know theres a big overflow crowd in the next building over, 7, 40
I think they can see and hear us but I wanted to thank them for being part of todays event, 40, 60
"And Ive got to recognize Joshua Simmons who just introduced me, 60, 71
He is a civics teacher at Pompano Beach Middle School and boy are his students lucky to have him and his enthusiasm, 71, 93
And I want to also commend him for talking about his mother and how hard she worked and his sister who he helped to raise, 93, 118
We really are stronger together and that starts in families and neighborhoods and communities." "Well you heard from a lot of my friends who represent you starting with my great friend and former colleague your Senator Bill Nelson, 118, 156
And I am looking forward to working with Bill as we make sure to continue the progress that will move us all forward together, 156, 180
And I sure hope Florida sends some reinforcements to the Senate and elect Congressman Patrick Murphy, 180, 196
I think Florida deserves a full-time senator dont you? And I want to thank my friend someone who has just worked her heart out not just for her constituents but for Democrats across America – Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, 196, 235
And another great friend of mine going back more years than we care to remember – Im so pleased hes here with us – Congressman Alcee Hastings, 235, 262
And I know that Congressman Ted Deutch who represents this district – is over in Israel for the funeral of a great great man Shimon Peres and I want to thank Ted for all of his support and his hard work." "Before I get started and really talk about everything thats at stake and what we have to do the next 39 days to make sure we win this election I wanted to say a few words about the tragic passing of Jose Fernandez, 262, 346
When he left Cuba he did not speak a word of English, 346, 358
He didnt let that stop him, 358, 364
He pursued his dreams, 364, 368
He wanted to and he became one of the best baseball players that Miami has ever seen, 368, 385
And he never forgot where he came from, 385, 393
He worked hard to give back to the community that had given so much to him, 393, 409
Joses life really embodied the American dream and at 24 years of age he was just getting started, 409, 427
Im sure you join me in saying that our thoughts and our prayers are with his family with his fans and everyone whose life he touched during his extraordinary career." "I also want to mention another resident of Coral Springs and thats a man named Bob Levinson, 427, 474
My heart goes out to Bobs family, 474, 481
He disappeared in Iran more than nine years ago and it is long past time for the Iranian regime to provide us information about his whereabouts and let him return home to his family." "Now did any of you see the debate the other night? Well I think it was pretty clear there are two very different choices for our country based on two very different visions of the kind of America that we want to have, 481, 558
My view is we are already great and if we work together we will become even greater in the years ahead, 558, 579
I believe America is an exceptional nation, 579, 586
My opponent believes America is in decline, 586, 593
Ive never heard such a dark and divisive terrible image of our country coming from someone running to be president of the United States, 593, 617
When he talks I lots of times dont even recognize the country hes talking about, 617, 632
And why are we already great? Well it is not just because of the size of our economy or the size of our military, 632, 656
It is because of our generosity; it is because of our ingenuity; it is because of the diversity of our country, 656, 677
I think our diversity is one of our strongest assets." "This morning I laid out my plan for more national service so that more people of all ages can serve America serve their communities, 677, 711
Because America is great when you really strip it all down because America is good, 711, 726
And we cant ever forget that." "I have laid out specific plans about how were going to make our country even greater, 726, 748
Ive actually got a book here with Tim Kaine my running mate, 748, 760
I have this old-fashioned idea: if Im asking you for your vote for president I should tell you what Im going to do, 760, 783
I shouldnt just talk in generalities and use rhetoric and never answer questions about what we can do but to lay out how were going to make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top." That means new jobs – new jobs with rising incomes jobs in infrastructure jobs in advanced manufacturing in innovation and technology and yes clean renewable energy jobs, 783, 848
"My opponents only infrastructure plan is to build a wall, 848, 858
I love that he went down to Mexico and he choked, 858, 869
He didnt even raise it, 869, 874
Hes been going around telling people for months Were going to build a wall and were going to make Mexico pay for it, 874, 897
So hes sitting with the president of Mexico and he doesnt even bring it up, 897, 912
He finds it a lot easier to insult women than to talk to the president of Mexico about building a wall, 912, 933
I mean really who gets up at 3 oclock in the morning to engage in a Twitter attack against a former Miss Universe? I mean he hurled as many insults as he could, 933, 966
Really why does he do things like that? I mean his latest Twitter meltdown is unhinged even for him, 966, 985
It proves yet again that he is temperamentally unfit to be president and commander-in-chief, 985, 999
I have said it before and Ill say it again: A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not be anywhere near the nuclear codes." "So Im going to keep talking about what we can do together after this election, 999, 1041
Getting those new jobs, 1041, 1045
And Ill tell you another area I want to emphasize is small business, 1045, 1058
As I said the other night my dad was a small businessman, 1058, 1070
He made a lot of sacrifice and he worked really hard to give us a good solid middle-class life, 1070, 1089
Im really proud of that, 1089, 1094
And Im sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump who stiffs small businesses doesnt pay his bills to people like my dad, 1094, 1119
But we need to do more to get small business started and growing – here in Broward County throughout South Florida across the state and beyond." "So as we grow the economy we also have to make it fairer, 1119, 1158
I want prosperity to reach everyone not just the privileged few, 1158, 1169
So we are going to raise the minimum wage be-cause if you work full-time you should not still be in poverty, 1169, 1190
And you know two-thirds of all minimum wage workers are women most of them supporting kids, 1190, 1206
And if you work full-time on a minimum wage job at the end of the year youve made $15000, 1206, 1225
I think we can do better, 1225, 1231
And I think we should because we want everybody to have a chance to get ahead and stay ahead and go as far as their hard work and talent will take them." "Something else were going to do is we are finally going to guarantee equal pay for womens work, 1231, 1281
Now this is not my friends just a womens issue, 1281, 1291
If you have a mother a wife a daughter a sister who is working its your issue too to make sure she is paid fairly, 1291, 1316
That will raise family incomes." "And then the third thing I want to do is to make sure – to make sure – more companies share profits with the workers who helped to create those profits in the first place, 1316, 1356
The other night at the debate one of my guests was Mark Cuban, 1356, 1369
He was sitting in the front row, 1369, 1376
And one of the reasons I was proud to have him there is he believes in profit-sharing, 1376, 1393
Hes always in his companies shared profits, 1393, 1400
And by the way he is a real billionaire, 1400, 1409
And when he sold his first company he shared the profits from the sale and 300 people who worked for him who helped to make him a success became millionaires, 1409, 1439
I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that not somebody who stiffs contractors who doesnt pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else but somebody who has the right attitude that were stronger together in business just like we are in government and America." "And the other thing we have to do more of is to make sure that we help deal with some of the stresses that American families are facing, 1439, 1526
It is hard to balance family and work isnt it? I think we can do better, 1526, 1542
I want to see us have paid family leave earned sick days affordable childcare and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college." "Now after the primary was over – and Senator Sanders and I ran a tough primary but you know what? I was really proud, 1542, 1589
We ran a campaign based on issues not insults, 1589, 1598
He and I got together and we said okay what are we going to do to make sure that more young people can actually get a college education? Because right now its way beyond what a lot of families can afford, 1598, 1639
And if you go into debt you come out of it with so much debt that remains a burden on you." "So the other day Senator Sanders and I were up in New Hampshire together and we were rolling out our plan, 1639, 1681
And its pretty simple, 1681, 1685
You can go to my website but let me just tell you briefly, 1685, 1698
If you are in a family that makes less than $125000 you will not pay tuition to go to a public college or university, 1698, 1722
And if you make more than that you will pay what you can afford but you will not have to borrow money because it will be debt-free for you to go, 1722, 1753
And we put together a calculator on my website, 1753, 1762
You can go to hillaryclinton.com/ calculator and you can see how much you will save how much your child or your grandchild would save under this plan." "But I also believe a four-year college degree which is an important part of getting an education to get ahead should not leave you mired in debt, 1762, 1816
So we are going to help you refinance your debt get the interest rates down and if youre willing to do public service national service were going to forgive your debt over time." But not everyone has to go for a four-year degree, 1816, 1859
I want every person not just young people but people who are looking for a different opportunity or may have to retrain – I want to everybody to have a chance for a good solid job, 1859, 1895
I think we made a mistake when we took vocational education out of high school, 1895, 1910
We need to put technical education back into high school, 1910, 1920
"And we need to make sure that community colleges are free so that young people starting in high school can take courses at community college to get the training they need for a good job, 1920, 1955
And I want to see business and labor unions working together for real apprenticeship programs – not the kind that lead to being told Youre fired the kind that lead to being told Youre hired." "Now Im excited about this, 1955, 1995
I really am, 1995, 1998
I am confident and optimistic about our country, 1998, 2006
We never get anything done if all we do is get down in the mouth and feel bad and complain and try to blame somebody for something else, 2006, 2034
Thats not who we are as Americans, 2034, 2041
We need to lift ourselves up and we need to roll up our sleeves to get to work to make sure that future is what it should be for our country." "And while were doing that were going to make sure that our countrys safe and that America provides strong and steady leadership around the world, 2041, 2097
Sometimes when I listen to my opponent it kind of seems he doesnt know who our friends are versus our adversaries, 2097, 2118
He has this weird fascination with dictators, 2118, 2125
Hes kind of signed up for the Vladimir Putin wish list, 2125, 2136
He doesnt care whether NATO falls apart and he is really cavalier about other countries getting nuclear weapons, 2136, 2154
He said he doesnt care, 2154, 2159
Let Japan South Korea even Saudi Arabia get a nuclear weapon, 2159, 2170
Whoa! Thats the kind of dangerous reckless talk that people around the world pay attention to." "As I told him in the debate – he actually said Well we may or may not defend our allies in Asia, 2170, 2208
Words matter, 2208, 2210
And Americas word matters, 2210, 2214
We have to be reliable and trustworthy, 2214, 2221
People have to count on us, 2221, 2227
And weve got a lot of work to do around the world, 2227, 2239
We need to work hard for peace and prosperity, 2239, 2248
We need to tackle climate change together." "Climate change is real, 2248, 2259
Florida knows that, 2259, 2262
My opponent thinks its a hoax created by the Chinese, 2262, 2272
And what that means is he would not be able to take advantage of the economic opportunities that climate change presents, 2272, 2293
You see some countrys going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st Century, 2293, 2308
I think its going to be either China Germany or us, 2308, 2319
I want it to be us and it can be us if we make up our minds for that to happen, 2319, 2340
Lets deploy a half a billion more solar panels, 2340, 2349
Lets produce enough clean energy so that every home in America can be powered by it, 2349, 2365
Theres so much we can do together, 2365, 2372
And that means weve got to work with other countries and weve got to demonstrate that we support our allies whether theyre in Europe the Middle East with Israel or Asia that we stand with those who stand with us." And then finally one of the next priorities that I have if I am so fortunate enough as to be your president is to bring our country together, 2372, 2440
Ive got to tell you look disagreements political disagreements thats fine, 2440, 2451
Thats who we are, 2451, 2455
I dont know any two people in America who agree on everything politically with each other, 2455, 2471
And Ive known been fortunate enough to know a number of our more recent presidents, 2471, 2486
I didnt always agree with them either including my husband, 2486, 2496
But Ill tell you this: Republicans and Democrats alike I never doubt they were trying to put the countrys interests first, 2496, 2517
They were trying to bring people together not pit us against each other, 2517, 2530
And one of the things I will do from the very beginning the very first day of my administration..."  "Day one."  "...is to make them day one – youre right – is to make sure everybody in the country knows Im the president of every American every single per-son, 2530, 2579
"Now – so in order for me to do any of this anything thats in this book and making sure that its paid for by the wealthy and corporations who have to pay their fair share finally all of that depends upon whether we win in November, 2579, 2626
The stakes could not be higher, 2626, 2632
So here is what I am asking all of you, 2632, 2642
How many of you know you are registered to vote? So we need to get everybody to be registered at your current address by October 11th, 2642, 2668
If youve moved you may need to reregister, 2668, 2676
Heres how you can find out if you are registered, 2676, 2686
You can go to iwillvote.com iwillvote.com, 2686, 2692
You put in your name, 2692, 2697
You put in your address and make sure youre registered, 2697, 2707
If you need to get registered we have volunteers here, 2707, 2717
Right? And they will – they have – they have clipboards, 2717, 2728
Were kind of low-tech about it, 2728, 2734
They have clipboards, 2734, 2737
They can help you get registered right here and now or as I say you can go to iwillvote.com and check your registration, 2737, 2760
And remember you can vote by mail starting October 24th here in Broward, 2760, 2773
And the other thing you can do is convince everybody you know to make sure theyre registered and to help them know how to vote by mail so they could get their vote in without making any fuss or inconvenience." "So make no mistake, 2773, 2817
This election is going to be close, 2817, 2824
They always are, 2824, 2827
So every call you make every door you knock on every person you register could make the difference, 2827, 2845
So Im asking you to go ahead and text JOIN text JOIN J?O?I?N to 47246 to get involved or go to hillaryclinton.com, 2845, 2867
And you can volunteer and become involved, 2867, 2874
If we win Broward County by as big a margin as we should win it we win Florida." "And like I say Im not just excited about winning an election, 2874, 2904
Im excited about doing the work, 2904, 2910
Im excited about listening to Americans, 2910, 2916
Ill continue to travel our country, 2916, 2922
Ill be here in Florida so much youll get sick of me because I want to be a good partner for Florida, 2922, 2944
I mean Florida is already suffering from climate change and you have a governor who ordered the state government never to say the word or write the phrase, 2944, 2972
Thats kind of hard to believe, 2972, 2978
So theres a lot were going to do together: jobs rising incomes opportunities, 2978, 2991
And thats what gets me excited." So heres what I hope you will do, 2991, 3005
When you leave here if somebody says Where were you this afternoon? you say Oh I went to a rally for Hillary Clinton, 3005, 3028
If they say Oh thats great" get them registered, 3028, 3037
If they say Oh my gosh, 3037, 3043
How can you do that? if theyre seriously thinking about voting for my opponent stage an intervention really because remember remember friends dont let friends vote for Trump, 3043, 3071
And what we believe and what were going to prove on November 8th is love trumps hate, 3071, 3088
Thank you all so much." , 3088, 3093
