"Last nights horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers â€“ five of whom were killed and seven wounded - is an attack on our country, 0, 27
It is a coordinated premeditated assault on the men and women who keep us safe." We must restore law and order, 27, 48
We must restore the confidence of our people to be safe and secure in their homes and on the street, 48, 68
The senseless tragic deaths of two people in Louisiana and Minnesota reminds us how much more needs to be done, 68, 88
"This morning I offer my thoughts and prayers for all of the victims families and we pray for our brave police officers and first responders who risk their lives to protect us every single day." "Our nation has become too divided, 88, 129
Too many Americans feel like theyve lost hope, 129, 137
Crime is harming too many citizens, 137, 143
Racial tensions have gotten worse not better, 143, 150
This isnt the American Dream we all want for our children." This is a time perhaps more than ever for strong leadership love and compassion, 150, 175
We will pull through these tragedies, 175, 181
