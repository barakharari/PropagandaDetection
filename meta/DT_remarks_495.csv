Were going to renegotiate those trade deals reduce surging crime, 206, 216
You saw what happened the other day murders in the United States the highest level in 45 years, 216, 234
You dont hear that from the press, 234, 241
" n "Were going to cut taxes big league, 241, 250
Crooked Hillary is going to raise taxes, 250, 257
Were going to cut taxes and regulations, 257, 264

" n And we are going to once again put America first, 343, 355
 n "The deadline for voter register who is not registered? Is there anybody in here not registered? If youre not registered get the hell out of here OK? " n "Theres a nice looking young guy hey listen leave right now and go and register, 355, 400
" n "They just extended it for a little while so right after you raise your right hand, 400, 418

" n Also you can request an absentee ballot and you can vote by mail if necessary, 537, 554
So register request a ballot.n Thank you, 554, 561
I love you, 561, 564
I love you too.n "The Hillary Clinton documents have you been seeing this whats going on? Released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in November and how unattractive and dishonest our country has become.n" "The election of Hillary Clinton would lead in my opinion to the almost total destruction of our country as we know it, 564, 627
She would be the most dishonest and the most corrupt person ever elected to high office, 627, 643
And I dont think it would be close.n" The WikiLeaks e-mails show the Department of Justice fed information did you see this? to the Clinton campaign.n So think of this, 643, 673
The Department of Justice you remember that whole deal with Wild Bill getting on the back of an airplane just happened to be in Arizona.n He was gonna play golf, 673, 703
It was 110 degrees.n But he gets on the back of the airplane to meet with the Attorney General to talk about his golf game and to talk about his grandkids, 703, 734
He was there for 39 minutes, 734, 740
 n I think most of us know what happened, 740, 749
 n So fed information Department of Justice fed information think of this to the Clinton campaign about the e-mail investigation so that the campaign could be prepared to cover up her crimes, 749, 781
Now did you ever hear  n Did you ever hear anything like this?  n "And and by the way these dishonest people mainstream media they dont talk about this, 781, 810
They dont talk about this, 810, 815
Now if I sneeze if Donald Trump sneezes today its a major story, 815, 828
" n Here you have Department of Justice coming to see them to brief them prior to their interview, 828, 847
Folks this is out of control.n "And the FBI unbelievable people, 847, 858
You have incredible people in the FBI, 858, 865
I would be willing to be that they are so ashamed of whats happened at the upper level.n" "I would be willing to bet that they dont even sleep at night.n" "These are great people, 865, 900
These are great Americans, 900, 904
And they cant believe whats going on.n" This corruption and collision is just one more reason why I will ask my Attorney General to appoint a special prosecutor, 904, 932
 n "Our country has never been so low, 932, 940
In addition to a special prosecutor to look into what happened and all of the corruption and all of the well say so called crime.n" But look when somebody deletes 33000 e-mails after getting a subpoena, 940, 976
But we have to also remember this remember this, 976, 985
This is maybe in a sense even more important.n We have to investigate the investigation, 985, 1000
 n We have to investigate the investigation, 1000, 1007
 n "Weve never had a case like this, 1007, 1015
And even Congress you know is sort of theyve never had this before because theres no event like this that ever took place.n" Normally Congress you know she lied to Congress, 1015, 1046
She lied to the FBI, 1046, 1051
And remember he said she was negligent, 1051, 1058
She was all the things you needed to be but she lied to Congress she lied to the FBI she lied to everybody she even lied in the debates about the gold standard right.n "Remember she said I never said gold standard, 1058, 1100
And remember when I said line in the sand? She said I wasnt secretary of state, 1100, 1116
I said I think you were but lets see even the press said she was secretary of state so she lied about that.n" "But think of this, 1116, 1143
Think of this, 1143, 1146
Theres never been a time like this in our country, 1146, 1156
And Congress in all fairness and Im so disappointed in them, 1156, 1167
I am so disappointed in Congress, 1167, 1173
I am so disappointed, 1173, 1177
" n "And I mean both sides, 1177, 1184
Im not talking Republican Dem Im talking everybody, 1184, 1192
To allow a thing like this to go this is crime at the highest level, 1192, 1207
She shouldnt be allowed to run for president, 1207, 1215
You know that, 1215, 1218
" n "Other peoples lives have been ruined destroyed for doing a tiny fraction of what she did, 1218, 1236
You saw the man with the book he had to give back all the royalties and went through hell, 1236, 1255
You saw the man with the picture of the submarine his mother goes around shes devastated devastated, 1255, 1272
Took pictures of a submarine, 1272, 1277
And you take a look at this.n" "So we have to investigate the investigation and Congress but I speak to Congressmen, 1277, 1298
They dont know what to do, 1298, 1304
Because normally they vote and they hand it over to the FBI and the Justice Department, 1304, 1320
But the FBI and the Justice Department wont do anything so they dont know what to do, 1320, 1337
" n Now they do make laws, 1337, 1344
Maybe they have to make up a law for a case like this, 1344, 1357
But they take these criminal acts in my opinion criminal acts hand them over to the FBI the FBI actually acknowledge that even frankly could have gone that speech could have been 10 times longer.n "But all of these things yes she did this yes she did this yes she did that yes she did that but were not going to do anything right but what do you do when you hand them over to the FBI and the Justice Department and thats the end of it? We have never been in a position like this.n" "Im so embarrassed by whats taken place and Im very very disappointed in Congress because our people our politicians I dont know do they make a deal where everybody protects each other in Washington? Maybe thats it, 1357, 1490
I really believe it, 1490, 1494
I really believe it, 1494, 1498
I almost say listen were going to leave you alone but when its our turn you have to leave them alone, 1498, 1519
Do they make deals like this?n" "This is the most heinous the most serious thing that Ive ever seen involving justice in the United States in the history of the United States, 1519, 1551
We have a person that has committed crimes that is now running for the presidency and she has the Justice Department where she essentially told the AG in the speech or a talk that shed appoint her AG again, 1551, 1590
And this is the person thats supposed to be ruling?n" "Folks whether I win lose or draw Im ashamed of whats happened to our country and so are you, 1590, 1619
" n Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33000 e-mails, 1619, 1628
And did you see two days ago boxes of e-mails and other things were missing? They were missing.n "So she deleted 33000 e-mails and bleached them, 1628, 1654
By the way nobody bleaches; nobody I have people that are sophisticated in this world, 1654, 1669
They never even heard of it, 1669, 1675
They called it acid wash meaning you can never retrieve them although I have a feeling that the NSA has them, 1675, 1696
They dont want them, 1696, 1700
They dont want to get them, 1700, 1706
I have a feeling, 1706, 1710
" n So then she did this after not before, 1710, 1720
Before would be bad, 1720, 1724
She did this after getting a congressional subpoena.n "Now if your friend is suing you in a regular lawsuit and you do that you go to jail, 1724, 1751
Heres the United States Congress subpoenas her e-mails and other things and she deletes the e-mails saying there are 33000 e-mails remember? for the wedding and for yoga classes 33000 e-mails, 1751, 1782
" n "And then and then after all of that now theyre missing two boxes of perhaps the most important of the group.n" "And what about her law firm? You know what? Shes using a phenomenal law firm, 1782, 1820
I know the firm, 1820, 1824
Phenomenal law firm, 1824, 1827
Theyre the ones that did all this stuff, 1827, 1835
Remember they said we made a ruling they were work-related, 1835, 1845
You cant do that, 1845, 1849
If theyre work- related what you do is you show them you show them and you get them, 1849, 1867
Its a law firm nobody ever mentions, 1867, 1874
The law firm is unbelievable, 1874, 1879
Its very powerful, 1879, 1882
OK?n" "Obviously theyve done a great job, 1882, 1889
But that law firm should be implicated in this crime, 1889, 1899
OK? " n Theyre the ones they got rid of all this stuff, 1899, 1912
The law firm got rid of all this stuff, 1912, 1921
And they should be implicated because they have committed a crime, 1921, 1932
They are not supposed to say "Oh we got rid of most of it." That law firm that I know very well as I said total professionals total insiders they got rid of 33000 and much more than that, 1932, 1971
It is one of the great miscarriages of justice.n So then she destroyed her phones some with a hammer to cover up her crimes, 1971, 1995
Now how many of you people have gotten rid of cell phones and you start whacking them with a hammer? Has any please raise your hand? Please, 1995, 2022
One, 2022, 2023
What business are you in?n "I see two hands, 2023, 2032
We have 15000, 2032, 2035
Two hands, 2035, 2037
Anybody else? It is so disgraceful, 2037, 2043
Its so embarrassing, 2043, 2046
And by the way were going to go over some of the WikiLeaks stuff, 2046, 2060
The press hardly reports it, 2060, 2065
They hardly report it, 2065, 2069
She did a big number of Catholics horrible number on Catholics, 2069, 2080
She did a horrible number on evangelicals through her people.n" And they hardly report it, 2080, 2095
While she was secretary of state she lost or disappeared almost $6 billion, 2095, 2108
Does anyone know that? No, 2108, 2113
How do you lose $6 billion? Even Chelsea Clinton in the WikiLeaks emails expressed quote "serious concerns about conflicts of interest at the Clinton Foundation and the State Department."n "Americans have had it with the years and decades of Clinton corruption, 2113, 2154
Its corruption Whitewater cattle, 2154, 2158
" n "Never is with these people, 2158, 2165
Remember years ago most of you are too young to remember, 2165, 2176
Remember the cattle? She bought some cattle and she had the greatest return like almost in the history of cattle deals? And some of these professional cattlemen and cattle women they say boy shes really good at this stuff, 2176, 2215
Theyd been doing it all their lives they had never had a return like that, 2215, 2230
Its corruption folks, 2230, 2233
Its corruption.n" "They understood that by the way, 2233, 2241
Theyre smart they got it very quickly.n" "This will finally be the year the American people say enough is enough, 2241, 2261
During a recent trip to Florida I had a chance to spend some time with the incredible residents of Little Haiti and you see whats going on in Haiti its a horrible thing, 2261, 2294
And you see whats going on with Clinton its a horrible thing, 2294, 2306
These are not fans of Clinton, 2306, 2312
That I can tell you.n" "They despise the Clintons for what they did to the Haitian people, 2312, 2329
New e-mails revealed by ABC News just yesterday show that during the deadly earthquake in Haiti which killed over 150000 people the Clintons couldnt stop cashing in, 2329, 2356
They kept cashing in.n" As people were dying in Haiti Clinton insiders were separating out requests from friends of Bill or William Jefferson Clinton VIPs so that their business interests or contracts would receive very special treatment while those who were not special friends would be put permanently on the sidelines.n "And remember this, 2356, 2410
Hillarys brother running a gold mine put on the gold Tony you saw Tony, 2410, 2424
Tony, 2424, 2425
Anybody want to hire Tony? Hes put on the board of a big gold mine company having to do with Haiti, 2425, 2446
Its so bad.n" "Look were in a rigged system folks, 2446, 2456
This is a rigged rigged system, 2456, 2462
You saw so many of the things, 2462, 2469
Ill tell you this WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable, 2469, 2477
It tells you the inner heart you got to read it, 2477, 2488
And you got to maybe get it because theyre not putting it out, 2488, 2501
They want to put it out but they cant do that because without the media and without the press Hillary Clinton would be nothing, 2501, 2525
Shed be nothing, 2525, 2528
Zero, 2528, 2529
" n And by the way did everybody see the debate the other day yes?  n So they had nine online polls, 2529, 2551
Some of them had us 90 to 10 80 to 20, 2551, 2562
"Time Magazine" had like a massive look "Time Magazine" is no friend of mine except they put me on the cover so much, 2562, 2585
Not because they like me because they like selling magazines.n But "Time Magazine" it was total destruction, 2585, 2602
And then the next morning she walks in and says did everybody see the debate? People go yes yes, 2602, 2621
Did we beat her or what? I look so forward n I do, 2621, 2634
I look so forward to the next one in Las Vegas.n "As Haitis death toll from Hurricane Matthew is on the rise we should never forget how Bill and Hillary Clinton handled Haiti the last time, 2634, 2670
To all our friends in Little Haiti theyre great people, 2670, 2680
I mean I spent a long time these are people that are incredible, 2680, 2693
They have the warmest feeling the warmest heart, 2693, 2701
But to all of our friends in Little Haiti your day of justice is coming believe me, 2701, 2718
" n And it arrives on November 8, 2718, 2726
November 8 get out and vote.n The new e-mails also show members of the Clinton team viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals, 2726, 2747
They attacked Catholics and evangelicals, 2747, 2752
 n Viciously, 2752, 2754
 n "And that wont be tolerated but it wont be tolerated by the voters, 2754, 2768
Tell you what anybody of religion I really think you have to vote for Donald Trump to be honest with you, 2768, 2789
I really do believe it, 2789, 2794
" n "And in all of the primaries you saw that, 2794, 2805
I wasnt expected to win with evangelicals but once we got started and once they heard my message as opposed to other peoples messages we really we won big with evangelicals, 2805, 2836
Theyre incredible people, 2836, 2839
" n "Remember the Johnson Amendment, 2839, 2845
Were gonna get rid of that Johnson Amendment, 2845, 2853
Just remember that, 2853, 2856
" n "These emails are just the latest evidence of the hatred that the Clinton campaign has for everyday faithful Americans, 2856, 2877
True, 2877, 2878
The Wikileaks email show that Hillary Clintons staff even has to give her secret notes on when she needs to smile, 2878, 2899
Smile Hillary, 2899, 2901
Smile, 2901, 2902
" n "Hey folks we have to get back to work, 2902, 2913
Our countrys in trouble, 2913, 2917
We cant play games anymore, 2917, 2922
Smile, 2922, 2923
You believe it? Smile, 2923, 2927
" n "And how about where it said to the public you say this but to the others that give you the money you say that, 2927, 2953
Ill tell you, 2953, 2956
Its so revealing somebodys going to do a great book on that because the press just did not little tiny stories big big things, 2956, 2980
Getting answers for debates and questions for debates before the debate takes place, 2980, 2993
How about that?n" "Ill tell you what, 2993, 3000
Can you imagine me if any of this stuff pertained to me? Front page headlines all over the world Donald Trump oh well weve been there and we seem to be doing really well.n" Hillary Clinton commonly referred to as Crooked Hillary thinks that you all of you are deplorable and totally irredeemable, 3000, 3053
 n "I actually think irredeemable is worse I dont know, 3053, 3063
Im the only one, 3063, 3067
Deplorable and irredeemable, 3067, 3070
Irredeemable meaning meaning you can never ever come back, 3070, 3079
I call you hard-working American patriots and together we are going to save this country and we are going to make America great again, 3079, 3103
" n "And its hot as hell in here but I dont care, 3103, 3116
" n Call it Florida right? Florida, 3116, 3123
 n "Emails also show that the DNC vice-chair was feeding information so much information to the candidate, 3123, 3140
Oh man I want that why cant the Republicans do that? Why cant Reince feed me information prior to a debate, 3140, 3161
Im so angry at the Republicans I want to be fed information like Hillary gets, 3161, 3176
" n "And we still beat her badly right? So I mean whats the big deal? But I want information, 3176, 3196
The Republicans are not doing their job, 3196, 3203
They should be able to get me all of the questions prior to the debate.n" This all comes after a secret tape that shows Hillary Clinton calling Bernie voters now look Bernie I feel sorry for Bernie.n He made a deal with the devil and he blew his reputation, 3203, 3252
But she called Bernie voters basement dwellers.n "So all of the Bernie votes out there join our movement like all of these young people, 3252, 3276
Were going to fix our trade deals and get special interests out of government.n" "And by the way by the time this ends Ill have over a hundred million dollars of my money in this thing right which means thats $100 million of people that dont have to give me money and say Donald will you do this will you do that will you do that? " n "Thats a lot of money, 3276, 3349
" n "And I asked her the other night I said you know I will have over a hundred million and thats a lot of money, 3349, 3375
If I lose Im going to be so angry at Florida, 3375, 3386
" n "Ill still love you I think, 3386, 3394
Maybe not, 3394, 3396
" n "You know one of the pundits said and youve heard me say this maybe but they said Mr, 3396, 3416
Trump it doesnt matter whether you win or lose, 3416, 3425
You have done the single greatest job, 3425, 3432
nobodys ever done a thing like this before, 3432, 3440
No matter where we go its like this, 3440, 3448
But.., 3448, 3449
" n "They said its the single Bill OReilly said it but many peoples said its the single greatest political phenomena theyve ever seen, 3449, 3473
I said wait a minute youre wrong.n" "If I dont win on November 8th I will consider this the single greatest waste of time energy and money of anything Ive ever done because were not going to be able to reduce your taxes were not going to be able to save your Second Amendment appoint Supreme Court judges take care of you vets fix up your depleted very depleted the greatest people on earth but our military is so depleted.n" "Were going to take care of a lot of things including getting the drugs out, 3473, 3568
A vote for Hillary is a vote for more reckless foreign invasions, 3568, 3580
What a mess did she do does she go down as the all-time worst?n" "More Wall Street cheating more terrible trade deals, 3580, 3602
And as WikiLeaks showed she wants to cut your Medicare and Social Security benefits, 3602, 3616
You didnt see that, 3616, 3620
" n "See? And Im not going to, 3620, 3628
The press doesnt report that she wants to cut your Social Security, 3628, 3640
And she wants to cut Medicare and one of the big advantages of me having a rather large microphone meaning a lot of people are listening is that I can talk about WikiLeaks and look its on al the television networks live, 3640, 3682
Were live, 3682, 3684
" n Amazing, 3684, 3687
 n "I think they are just turning them all off now, 3687, 3698
Watch, 3698, 3699
You go home theyll say why did it end so abruptly?n" "A vote for Trump is a vote for America first and its a vote to protect Medicare and Social Security and lower your taxes, 3699, 3734
" n "Big big tax decrease, 3734, 3740
Were going to lower your taxes, 3740, 3746
WikiLeaks also shows something Ive been warning about for a very very long time, 3746, 3760
The media is simply an extension of the Clinton Campaign, 3760, 3770
" n "Its one of the biggest ways that our system is rigged, 3770, 3783
And I was the first one to use that term when I was running in the primaries when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than people that I beat easily.n" "And my people said oh no thats the way the system I say well then the systems wrong! How do you win a state and you get less delegates?n" "And I said this system is rigged! And it was but we figured out how to win right? Thats what you need, 3783, 3866
" n Won in a landslide, 3866, 3872
I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party in the primaries system  n "By far, 3872, 3892
Wasnt even close, 3892, 3895
" n "Reporters who work for these outlets like the Washington Post or the New York Times may think of themselves as journalists but theyre actually cogs for a corrupt political machine, 3895, 3927
Thats the Clinton machine, 3927, 3931
The e-mail show the New York Times the Boston Globe Univision who I sued I sued Univision and I was very happy with what they did, 3931, 3957
" n And this lightweight you know John Hardwood this lightweight, 3957, 3968
This guy who came out he was shaking, 3968, 3976
He was so nervous.n He asked me the first question "Mr, 3976, 3987
Trump could you answer this question?" What a lightweight, 3987, 3996
They shoulda fired him for what he did.n "John Harwood, 3996, 4006
I hate to make him famous but cause nobody ever heard of him before but a total lightweight of CNBC all doing favors for the Clintons.n" And reporters smothering the Clintons with praise, 4006, 4039
The New York Times even gave Clinton a call to give her a veto power over her quotes in a story that was already written, 4039, 4064
Nobody ever called me and said "Hi Mr, 4064, 4072
Trump, 4072, 4073
We wrote a story, 4073, 4077
Would you read the story and please give us a little feedback, 4077, 4089
