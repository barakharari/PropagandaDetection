"Hillary will be a president who wont have to be taught to say the words ?transgender or ?equality." Sarah McBride "Ive been volunteering for candidates since the age of 10, 0, 30
When I came out my passion for equality became all the more real and personal.What do you tell friends or family who may not have made up their mind about who to support?The presidency is the hardest job in the world and requires someone who understands that our problems cannot be boiled down to one source or one solution." "Ill be thinking of my late husband Andy, 30, 97
Andy was a transgender man and passed away a little over a year ago at the age of 28, 97, 116
When we found out that Andys cancer was terminal he asked me to marry him, 116, 131
We held our wedding on the roof of our building, 131, 141
Just four days later Andy passed away, 141, 148
As an LGBT health advocate Andy knew better than most the impact of the Affordable Care Act in expanding access and opening up health care to LGBT Americans, 148, 176
Ill be thinking about his work and the need to preserve and build on the Affordable Care Act when I vote, 176, 197
But Ill also be thinking about the lesson I learned from his passing, 197, 210
Andy had the courage to live true to himself at a young age, 210, 223
He was supposed to have three quarters of his life as his authentic self, 223, 237
But because of circumstances beyond his control he had less than a quarter, 237, 250
Some have even less than that, 250, 256
Every day matters when it comes to building a world where every person can live their life to the fullest." "Shes the only candidate running to have delivered tangible progress for the transgender community when she reformed passport policies at the State Department and added gender identity to the departments employment policies, 256, 308
Shes laid out a detailed and life-saving platform on LGBT equality and has routinely and proactively spoken about our needs as a community to LGBT and non-LGBT audiences alike, 308, 337
More than anything else Im supporting Hillary because like she says shes not a single issue candidate because we do not live in a single issue country, 337, 364
I know she has the skills experience and solutions necessary to move equality and opportunity forward for people of all backgrounds and identities in every state." Blossom Brown When I started to transition from male to female, 364, 401
Prior to that I felt like politics were not my forte, 401, 412
But as I began to experience discrimination in both the education and health system I felt that it was time for me to care about politics and vote carefully for the candidate who would best address our needs and be more inclusive of the trans community, 412, 458
That they should vote for Hillary because she is inclusive of all communities and that she can continue to make the positive progress in Washington, 458, 483
I always remind them that we do not need bigots of any kind in the White House and we also do not need a candidate who thinks that certain groups should be banned from the United States, 483, 520
We need to have Hillary in office fighting for the rights of all American people! As a trans-health advocate it means a lot to me that all transgender people get to receive the entire appropriate health care we are entitled to—that we are not discriminated against and that we are treated like human beings and not as animals in the health system, 520, 582
I am seeing too many of my trans brothers and sisters who are dealing with this, 582, 598
Barbra Siperstein Growing up in Jersey City I was always surrounded by politics and was politically aware, 598, 615
It was not until after my wife of 34 years died suddenly in late 2001 that I realized how stigmatized and vulnerable I was as a single transgender person and how necessary it was to involve myself in the political system in order to create change assert civil rights and gain societal respect, 615, 668
I understand and share their fear anger and frustration, 668, 677
I tell them to clear the air and understand what is real and what is not what is perceived may be partly true or not at all, 677, 704
I ask who is the one person who can step into the Oval Office prepared to act effectively from day one? Who has shown an effective learning curve and grown over the years? Who has done what she did as secretary of state and has a positive record of working with diverse people as a senator from New York?  I will be thinking about my grandchildren and the kind of world and opportunities they will have to enable for themselves and their families a happy comfortable secure and productive life regardless of race be they male or female straight or gay cis or trans gender, 704, 809
I believe that she wants to and is committed to doing the right thing, 809, 823
She has the experience character strength and learning ability to lead America better than any other candidate, 823, 840
Lou Weaver Eight years ago, 840, 845
When I started my cultural transition, 845, 851
This is an important election and will have far reaching ramifications, 851, 862
In order to work towards equity for everyone we need to elect the best candidate—and that is Hillary Rodham Clinton, 862, 882
The futures of myself and my transgender siblings, 882, 890
The state of the country as a whole, 890, 898
I believe she is the best person to continue to move our country forward, 898, 912
Zackary Drucker In fourth grade—the election of 1992: George Bush vs, 912, 923
Bill Clinton vs, 923, 926
Ross Perot, 926, 928
That was the first election I was consciously aware of because I have a family who is solidly Democrat and they had been fairly disgusted of three terms with a Republican president, 928, 960
I remember watching the debates with my family cutting newspaper clippings and keeping them in a scrapbook! "If somebody hasnt made up their mind its important to at least stress the importance of voting Democrat, 960, 995
The war and hate mentality of Republicans is self-perpetuating and its stirring a pot of anti-American rage that is really dangerous for our future." I feel like beyond my personal rooting for Hillary and being a long-term supporter since her first senate race as a member of the trans community Hillary Clinton has such a solid plan for how to cement the rights of trans people in America and women around the world, 995, 1068
The rights of trans people and women is my number one priority in voting, 1068, 1082
Ames Simmons I have always cared about politics having been fortunate to have been raised with a strong commitment to civic responsibility and community leadership by two parents who had long federal service careers—and who imparted a similar love of policy and service to my community, 1082, 1128
I absolutely voted in the Super Tuesday primary and will vote in the general election in November as a transgender person who cares very much about LGBTQ politics and policy in the U.S, 1128, 1161
I never gave any serious consideration to any candidate other than Hillary Clinton, 1161, 1174
"I support Hillary because of her strong support of the LGBTQ community—and of trans issues in particular—and because she is tested and proven as a candidate who has the ability to get things done for our country, 1174, 1211
Hillarys ability to actually accomplish real and measurable progress for the trans community who otherwise does not have sufficient statistical strength to get things done by ourselves is significant, 1211, 1240
Hillarys commitment to progress in health care to womens rights to eradicating income inequality to racial justice are all deeply compelling factors in her candidacy." Kimi Cole January 2011, 1240, 1269
As my life was going through a major change I became keenly aware of inequities toward transgender people, 1269, 1287
I decided to get involved in the political process and take a stand for fair treatment rather than simply complaining from the sidelines, 1287, 1310
I have gained tremendous respect for Secretary Clinton ?for her courage to tackle tough issues her resilience in the face of brutal media scrutiny and her overt commitment to proactively acknowledging and supporting the LGB and Transgender communities, 1310, 1348
#ImWithHer "In addition to the obviously dangerous challenges being foisted on the LGBT communities by conservative activists its also very important to me in an increasingly dangerous world that we have a president who has a full grasp of the global stage in order to comprehensively address challenges and dangers while guiding our country forward." "Hillary Clinton is the ONLY presidential candidate in 2016 with full understanding and ability to continue building on the progress realized during President Obamas administration." Marisa Richmond When I was 4 my mother took me and my sister to see President Kennedy visit Nashville, 1348, 1447
We stood on the sidewalk in front of an old Texaco as the open limo motorcade went by, 1447, 1465
As he got right in front of me the president turned and smiled and waved right at me, 1465, 1483
I have been a committed Democrat and political junkie ever since, 1483, 1494
I respect my friends who "Feel the Bern" so I do not try to change their minds, 1494, 1511
But if I am asked why I am supporting Hillary I mention her experience in a number of areas especially foreign policy her longstanding support for universal health care and her work for human rights including the passport gender change policy from her days as secretary of state, 1511, 1559
She was also a co-sponsor of the Trans Inclusive Hate Crimes bill when she was a senator, 1559, 1576
Jay Brown "Leading up to November and on Election Day theres no doubt in my mind that Hillary Clinton is the best candidate, 1576, 1599
Im a transgender man a dad of two young daughters and a progressive committed to social justice, 1599, 1616
When I think about her record and her positions on trans and LGBT equality on HIV and AIDS on womens rights—on a range of issues that matter most to me—I know she is going to work hard building a better tomorrow and pushing forward on the issues that matter most." Janice Covington 1972—working on the campaign for Billy Creel for North Carolina Labor Commissioner! Vote Democrat and for Hillary! Because I feel she is the most qualified, 1616, 1693
Meghan Stabler "Ive always cared, 1693, 1698
Its part of the civic duty we have as citizens but most importantly its important to stand up for what is right to stand up for those who cant and ultimately move America forward to be a more perfect union." I lay out the candidates and what they care about, 1698, 1748
Not just lip service or media sound bites but real honest policies backed with experience is what matters, 1748, 1766
"Hillary and I have met a number of times and I know from the conversations weve had and the look in her eye that she passionately cares about LGBT equality and transgender equality in work life and military service, 1766, 1805
She is the only candidate who cares deeply about ALL of us." Diego Sanchez "My passion for politics began as a 12-year-old child delivering flyers to re-elect Congressman Henry B, 1805, 1835
Gonzalez (D-TX-20) Texass first Latino U.S, 1835, 1841
representative, 1841, 1842
Im as fired up now as I was then!" "I tell friends and family members who are undecided about how to cast their vote for president three things: One: Register and vote and get all of your friends to do the same, 1842, 1884
Two: Hillary Clinton must be our next president because of her public service experience her passionate and fearless leadership and her support of communities and people who cannot be forgotten and wont be by her, 1884, 1919
Three: These times are our most critical and I will work hard to gain support from everyone I know or can meet." As an openly trans aging adopted immigrant Latino man with roots in the deep South and New England I will be thinking of LGBTQ elders and youth—especially trans and gender expansive youth of color, 1919, 1975
I know that with solid supportive leadership under Hillary we can not only have hope but live safely to end discrimination and with evidence to have even more hope for generations present and future, 1975, 2009
I support Hillary because I want our next president to be brilliant and brave and she is both, 2009, 2027
Hillary will be a president who wont have to be taught to say the words "transgender" or "equality." I feel blessed to be a naturalized U.S, 2027, 2053
citizen and I feel responsible for doing all I can to improve our nation for the people who will be here when Im not, 2053, 2077
Supporting Hillary is an affirmative step toward that goal part of plotting a path to make our nation safer for people who reflect the many intersecting aspects that comprise me, 2077, 2107
