So how good is he? How good is he?  n Special, 0, 11
Special, 11, 12
He is a special man and special person, 12, 20
And he has become my friend, 20, 26
Oh there is a lot of people here, 26, 34
Whoa, 34, 35
 n Hello everybody, 35, 38
Your football team is going to have a great year, 38, 48
 n "I watch, 48, 51
I watch, 51, 53
Youve got the quarterback youve got the whole deal, 53, 62
I think its going to be a very good year, 62, 72
" n OK? And if you get into that Super Bowl I will be going all right?n So you know I wrote something down before and I think it is important because -- I love you too, 72, 109
 n "Because we need unity we have to win this election, 109, 120
This is truly one of the most important elections certainly in my lifetime, 120, 133
Because we are about to go -- we lose it we are in the wrong direction and maybe its gone, 133, 153
Supreme Court justices always remember that, 153, 159
But so many different levels and when you see what happened with crooked Hillary today it was a disaster, 159, 178
" n A disaster, 178, 182
She had a disaster, 182, 186
She lies folks she lies badly, 186, 192
 n So I want to -- I just wrote this out, 192, 203
I wanted to say to the group you know I had a great time when I was in Wisconsin and I did not quite eke it out, 203, 230
I thought I was going to but after that it worked out well, 230, 243
You built me up you taught me about politics.n "And when I left here I said I think Ive learned a lot, 243, 265
" n "So I love it, 265, 271
I love the people, 271, 275
I have many friends in Wisconsin, 275, 281
And theyre -- theyre incredible people, 281, 287
Youre incredible people I have to tell you that, 287, 296
" n "And were going to have a lot of fun, 296, 307
We are going to have a lot of fun but I had to write this, 307, 322
This campaign is not about me or any one candidate, 322, 332
It is about America, 332, 336
" n "It is time for a change, 336, 344
We need a change, 344, 348
A real change not an Obama change, 348, 355
We dont need an Obama change, 355, 361
We have had enough, 361, 365
It is time to change a rigged political system that works only for the insiders and replace it with a government that serves the people, 365, 390
" n "Have to do it, 390, 396
And know both sides, 396, 400
Ive been on the other side, 400, 406
Believe me, 406, 408
I actually like this side better; this is a movement, 408, 418
This is a movement like they may be have never seen in this country according to even the political pundits that truly hate me OK? This is a -- they -- oh this is a movement that some say most say is one of the great phenomenons that theyve ever seen in politics.n" "Some say its the single greatest phenomenon, 418, 478
" n "Though the media doesnt want to talk about it we have done something -- we, 478, 495
All of us together, 495, 499
Im a messenger; Im only a messenger, 499, 506
We have done something truly historic together standing before you as nominee for president and Im not a politician proudly, 506, 526
" n "Im not part of the system, 526, 534
I ran against the system and Im probably better off running against the system, 534, 548
" n "I ran against the donors, 548, 555
Im my own donor essentially, 555, 560
I have a lot of money under this deal, 560, 569
This is a very expensive crisis I want to tell you, 569, 580
" n "I funded -- as you know I funded the primaries, 580, 592
And Im in for under $60 million and Im largely funding my campaign as we go forward, 592, 609
In addition to that -- in addition to that we have raised tremendous amounts of money and much of it from small donors$61; $61, 609, 633
As a Republican that doesnt happen, 633, 639
It happens because of what you are seeing in front of you today.n" And if you remember just prior to June they did a story "Donald Trump has not really done too well with fund raising." Well that is because I did not even know if I was getting the nomination, 639, 690
Im not going to raise funds -- I wouldve had enough if I didnt make it, 690, 706
I would have said "Bye bye politics."n But I wanted to make sure -- so I got it, 706, 724
And then I started raising money for the Republican Party, 724, 734
and we raised a lot of money, 734, 741
We started really on June 14th Flag Day my birthday, 741, 751
My birthday, 751, 753
 n And in June we raised approximately -- think of this -- $51 million, 753, 767
Can you imagine?  n "And those people couldnt believe it; they were really surprised, 767, 781
Big headlines you know, 781, 785
Because they dont give me too many good headlines, 785, 794
I could do the greatest things, 794, 800
I do things that I think a fantastic.n" "I say good there is no way they cover this badly, 800, 819
And they cover it badly, 819, 824
I gently tell a woman that I love her baby and let the baby cry, 824, 839
It is OK, 839, 842
As the baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti continued to cry -- I remember I told her to stay dont worry maam.n" "But after about 3 or 4 minutes and Im trying to speak and it was in Jacksonville we had this massive massive crowd filled up the stadium, 842, 895
And the babys screaming, 895, 899
So I said maam I would like to reverse my order, 899, 910
Perhaps you could nicely take -- take the baby out, 910, 920
Your baby is greatn" I did it so nicely, 920, 929
She was happy, 929, 932
Even the baby was happy, 932, 937
He stopped crying, 937, 940
 n And maybe you could take the baby out would that be possible? The whole place was cracking up, 940, 959
And the next day in the newspaper it said "Trump throws baby out of arena."n Terrible, 959, 975
Now they are very dishonest, 975, 980
That was a tough one when I -- and I just had a reporter come up to me backstage a reporter come up -- "Mr, 980, 1005
Trump sir but why did you throw that baby out of the area?" I said "I was having fun, 1005, 1024
I was so nice I was so nice, 1024, 1032
Everybody likes me, 1032, 1035
The baby liked me the mother liked me, 1035, 1043
We had a good time, 1043, 1048
I try to keep the baby in but the baby was such -- had such a powerful voice  n "In fact I want to find out who that baby is because I want to sponsor the baby, 1048, 1085
And that baby will sing someday in Philharmonic Hall, 1085, 1094
Im telling you, 1094, 1097
New York City, 1097, 1100
OK? The great Philharmonic, 1100, 1104
" n "So Im not part of the system, 1104, 1113
I ran against the system, 1113, 1118
I ran against the donors because Im largely my own donor, 1118, 1129
Im running against myself, 1129, 1133
Thats sort of -- never thought of it that way, 1133, 1143
And against the status quo and the status quo we have to get rid of because it is not working folks because the country is a mess, 1143, 1170
" n And that is why put up a lot of money, 1170, 1182
But while the Democrats nominated the candidate of special interests and really a candidate of total corruption I mean you take a look at what she is doing the Republicans made history by choosing a nominee from outside of this very very corrupt the system, 1182, 1227
It is a corrupt system.n "Its a corrupt system, 1227, 1236
You want something done they can do it for you, 1236, 1246
And that is not necessarily and usually it isnt good for the country.n" "That is why were going to be able to deliver real change and real safety and real opportunity to all Americans, 1246, 1280
We have to unite, 1280, 1284
Remember that.n" "Everything Ive accomplished I have done by putting together a really fantastic team including Governor Mike Pence of Indiana who has done an incredible.., 1284, 1310
" n "Done an incredible job, 1310, 1316
My wonderful staff of people that really love what we are doing and they are working so hard, 1316, 1334
My family friends and its expanding all the time.n" But I need a Republican Senate and a House to accomplish all of the changes that we have to make, 1334, 1363
We have to make them right?  n "I understand and embrace the wisdom of Ronald Reagans big tent within the party big big tent remember? Ronald Reagan great man great guy, 1363, 1394
Remember he included Reagan Democrats and Independents and Republicans a lot of people, 1394, 1407
Were going to have the same thing, 1407, 1414
There a lot of Democrats perhaps in this room are there a lot of Democrats? Raise your hands, 1414, 1432
I mean I dont think we need too many to be honest with you but -- so I embraced the wisdom that my 80 percent friend is not my 20 percent enemy Ronald Reagan, 1432, 1466
" n Stated by Ronald Reagan pretty good.n We will be the big tent party, 1466, 1481
We are going to have a lot of cross help, 1481, 1491
We are going to have a lot of Bernie Sanders people coming in because of trade because Bernie Sanders knew we were being ripped off by trade, 1491, 1518
Trade is a disaster with China with Japan with Mexico with Vietnam with so many countries with every country every country.n "We dont win at any level with anything and as a unified party we will lead our country to unity as well very important, 1518, 1563
We need the unity we have to win the election, 1563, 1573
" n "No we have to win it --- have to win it, 1573, 1586
Otherwise our big movement was not as big as we thought and thats not good, 1586, 1601
Thats why November 8th youve got to get everybody you know -- and you know all this voter ID nowadays a lot of places arent going to have voter ID, 1601, 1631
Now what does that mean? What does that mean? You just keep walking in and voting? So you have to be very careful very vigilant -- you have to be carefuln" But we will have disagreements but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory and very importantly toward real change, 1631, 1686
 n So in our shared mission to make America great again I support and endorse our speaker of the House Paul Ryan, 1686, 1708
 n "Paul Ryan hes good, 1708, 1713
Hes a good man, 1713, 1717
Hes a good man and hes a good guy, 1717, 1726
And we may disagree on a couple of things but mostly we agree and were going get it done and were going to do a lot of wonderful things, 1726, 1755
" n "Hes a good man, 1755, 1761
And while Im at it I hold in the highest esteem Senator John McCain for his service to our country in uniform and in public office and I fully support and endorse his re-election, 1761, 1795
Very important, 1795, 1797
" n "Well work together, 1797, 1802
I also fully support and endorse Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, 1802, 1814
" n "A state I truly love primarily because that was my first victory but I love New Hampshire, 1814, 1833
No I love New Hampshire one of the most beautiful places, 1833, 1844
Shes a rising star and will continue to represent the great people of New Hampshire so very well for a long long time, 1844, 1867
Senator Kelly Ayotte, 1867, 1870
" n "Working hand-in-hand we will grow our majority in the House and in the Senate, 1870, 1886
We need that weve got to get things done, 1886, 1895
Arm in arm we will rescue the nation from the Obama-Clinton disaster which is exactly what it is that has bled our country dry and spread terrorism unabated across the world thats whats happening, 1895, 1929
You saw it just now Maps came out yesterday they said ISIS far bigger its all over the place, 1929, 1948
Its all over the place, 1948, 1953
Were going to get rid of it folks, 1953, 1961
" n "Our military is depleted, 1961, 1967
Were going to build up our military we are going to get others with us, 1967, 1982
Believe me were going to get plenty of others with us, 1982, 1993
And speaking of others wouldnt it actually be wonderful if we could get along with Russia? Wouldnt that be nice? " n "They talk so big and so brave and so tough theyre the tough ones, 1993, 2029
You know Hillarys real tough give me a break, 2029, 2038
Wouldnt that be great? We get along with Russia we go out together with others and we knock the hell out of ISIS wouldnt that be great? " n "Together we will lead our country back to prosperity security and peace, 2038, 2079
OK? When you look at the world and whats happened -- so we have the queen of corruption shes the queen of corruption, 2079, 2102
She is a disaster, 2102, 2106
I said before if crooked Hillary Clinton becomes president terrorism will destroy the inner workings of our country, 2106, 2124
Believe me they are loving it.n" "She wants to have 550 percent more people coming in from Syria and that region into our nation, 2124, 2148
And we dont know who they are we dont know where they come from really we dont know if theyre ISIS some will be, 2148, 2172
And look at the damage thats done in San Bernardino with a couple -- probably he became radicalized by her -- a couple and these were friends of theirs, 2172, 2201
These were people that gave a party in celebration of the birth of their child and they were gunned down 14 people killed many many injured.n" "Take a look at Orlando -- take a look at Orlando how disgusting that was, 2201, 2242
Take a look at the World Trade Center and so many other places, 2242, 2255
Go to the probably toughest gun laws anywhere in the world go to Paris and take a look at that 130 people gunned down, 2255, 2279
You know if people had guns on the other side where the bullets are flying in the other direction like you sir you sir you and you maam, 2279, 2307
" n "First of all if they knew guns were in the room they probably wouldnt have gone there, 2307, 2326
There were no guns, 2326, 2330
They were just sitting ducks 130 people, 2330, 2337
In San Bernardino you had 14 people.n" "But in Paris just like this boom -- get over here boom -- get over here boom -- 130 people with many still in the hospital many so gravely wounded, 2337, 2374
Its horrible, 2374, 2376
And if they had bullets flying in the other direction maybe they wouldnt have shown up and if they did Ill tell you what you wouldnt have had that kind of carnage, 2376, 2408
You would have had people lying on the other side of the floor instead, 2408, 2422
" n "So Hillary Clinton wants to do major damage as you know to our Second Amendment, 2422, 2439
Hillary Clinton wants to put judges -- she wants to put justices of the Supreme Court -- shes going to make them nice and liberal wait until -- wait until you see what that does to your rights, 2439, 2477
Wait until you see what that does to your Second Amendment, 2477, 2488
You will not recognize it you will not recognize it, 2488, 2498
National Rifle Association NRA endorsed me, 2498, 2504
" n "Theyre great people Wayne -- theyre great people Chris they love this country, 2504, 2519
They endorsed me very early and its really a -- its really an honor, 2519, 2533
Ill tell you what they are phenomenal people when you get to know them, 2533, 2547
They love the country -- you know they love the country, 2547, 2558
They take a lot of heat but they love the country Ill tell you that right now.n" "And I heard Mike Governor Pence talking about 1.2 growth -- 1.2 percent growth the lowest in memory since the 1940s, 2558, 2596
When you think about it its the lowest, 2596, 2604
So a lot of differences between all of us but I thought I would mention -- because Ive known Hillary Clinton over the years -- I know her -- and she makes statements, 2604, 2637
She makes statements and they are statements coming out of her playbook.n" Well lets see "we cant get them for this -- cant get them for this." Ive always heard that I have the best temperament people tell me I have the best temperament I have a temperament to win, 2637, 2687
We got to win, 2687, 2691
We got to win n She said not so long ago "I dont like Donald Trumps tone", 2691, 2708
Now she is reading it off teleprompters only, 2708, 2716
"I dont like Donald trumps tone." And I said you know "we need a tough tone today, 2716, 2733
We have people -- we need a kind tone but we need a tough tone."n We have people being beheaded all over the Middle East and other places, 2733, 2761
We have crime that is rampant, 2761, 2767
We have people in the Middle East being drowned in steel cages, 2767, 2779
This is like medieval times and she is worried about my tone.n So they chop off heads and they drown people and they bury people in sand, 2779, 2806
And then they ask me "Mr, 2806, 2812
Trump sir" -- at one of the debates in which I won Im very happy about that -- "Mr, 2812, 2831
Trump sir how do you feel about waterboarding?" Im seeing chopped off heads drowned people burying in sand -- I said "Im absolutely OK with it let me tell you."  n Can you imagine what the enemy must say -- can you imagine the enemy -- ISIS in this case -- can you imagine what they must say as they spent the day chopping off the heads of Christians -- "come back get together and start talking -- and they say waterboarding is not allowed in the United States -- by the United States waterboarding is not allowed."n Folks we better get smart and tough and we are playing games with Hillary we are playing games, 2831, 2947
It is just games she is not the right person and everybody knows it, 2947, 2961
Her single greatest achievement is being caught in a crime and getting away with it, 2961, 2976
 n This is true 33000 e-mails, 2976, 2982
 n "So I wrote this before on the way over to another rally at also a very nice place thats very full and very nice in Iowa, 2982, 3009
And we love Iowa dont we yes? Right? " n I thought it was accurate unstable -- and she is she is unstable, 3009, 3032
Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment that Bernie Sanders had, 3032, 3041
You just have to pay attention as soon as he said it I started writing notes, 3041, 3057
 n "She has bad judgment, 3057, 3062
She lacks the judgment temperament and moral character to lead this country, 3062, 3074
Plus she is a weak person." We dont need a weak person, 3074, 3086
He just said "plus she is a criminal."n She is a dangerous liar who has disregarded the lives of Americans and who has put all of us at great risk while supporting economic policies that have destroyed our economy, 3086, 3125
We have a long way to go.n She is unhinged shes truly unhinged and she is unbalanced totally unbalanced, 3125, 3144
And you can see in the words of a secret service agent who just wrote a book I bought the book I wanted to see what he had to say; "she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office."n "From my bottom of my soul" he said "I know this to be true." He was there, 3144, 3203
"Her leadership style volcanic impulsive as it is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else hasnt changed a bit, 3203, 3223
Shes unqualified to become president." And she really is and Bernie said that too, 3223, 3237
 n Thank you, 3237, 3240
What great people, 3240, 3243
Wow.n "No but it is true no games it is true, 3243, 3254
In one way she is a monster OK? Look at what happened look at her history, 3254, 3270
In another way she is a weak person she is actually not strong enough to be president, 3270, 3287
So shes got both but she is not strong enough to be president.n" "She will be a be a disaster, 3287, 3307
She will be so bad for our country and Im not just talking about Justices of the Supreme Court, 3307, 3326
She will be so bad for our country and we cant let it happen, 3326, 3340
We cant let it happen.n" You know Mike Pence told me a story and maybe I should not say it but I found it interesting but of the reasons -- I guess the primary reason that hes in politics is because he watched the crookedness of the Clintons when they were in the White House, 3340, 3395
And he said "he ran he ran again and he ran again and he won." You have to hand it to him this is the guy that does not give up, 3395, 3426
He does not quit, 3426, 3430
He never ever quits, 3430, 3434
 n "But he watched the Clintons -- and Im sure they will be thrilled to hear that -- but that actually got him into politics which is interesting.n" So then we make these horrible deals; Iran Deal horrible deal we got $150 billion -- and how about $400 million -- think of it $400 million in cash different currencies different denominations, 3434, 3495
Now lot of people say that money went toward terrorn "Im nicer than that see I dont have that horrible thought process that some people have in this room have, 3495, 3525
I say some of it went to terror but a lot of it went into their bank accounts believe me thats the way it is, 3525, 3550
It went into their pockets can you imagine these guys sitting there with $400 million in cash? You think theyre giving that money to terror they are giving that money to them and I guess terror got some of it but most of it they kept.n" I mean the concept of paying $400 million in cash is mind- boggling, 3550, 3609
I mean you wouldnt think -- who can authorize such a thing? Where did they get it? What did they do go to a bank teller and say "give me $400 million in cash? I want to in euros I want it in Swiss francs wrap it up we will come back in 10 minutes."n I mean it is just inconceivable, 3609, 3670
So we are witnessing a horror show in this country and throughout the world, 3670, 3684
You look at what is going on throughout the world with these same people these people funding terror -- these people are funding terrorism, 3684, 3708
For us to have given $400 million to basically free our hostages.n Now Obama just like he lied about Obamacare which was a tremendous lie that was a tremendous lie remember? "You can keep your plan you can keep your doctor." Really? How many people have been able to keep the doctor or their plan?n Keep your plan keep your doctor -- not working that way folks, 3708, 3775
It is a disaster, 3775, 3779
By the way it is going to be repealed and replaced 100 percent, 3779, 3792
 n "And -- and honestly I hope I win because we will do a great job, 3792, 3808
We are going to make America great again, 3808, 3816
Were going to make America great again, 3816, 3823
" n "But I actually think that regardless of who wins Obamacare is going to fold in any event, 3823, 3842
It is so expensive, 3842, 3846
People cant afford it and the country cant afford it, 3846, 3856
Other than that it is just wonderful, 3856, 3863
So in Texas they just had almost a 60 percent increase, 3863, 3874
Now the increases are starting to come out, 3874, 3882
The big increase is going to be announced on November 1st, 3882, 3893
The election is November 8th, 3893, 3898
Folks they want to delay it because it is election-changing, 3898, 3908
It is a mess.n" "It is election changing and they want to change it, 3908, 3922
And we cant let that happen.n" "Because the numbers -- and I can see some of the numbers already -- the numbers are going to be astronomical, 3922, 3949
They are going to be astronomical, 3949, 3955
Theyre going to be so big so horrible and the health care you know the plan is terrible, 3955, 3973
Its terrible, 3973, 3975
And were going to take care of everybody but were going to end up with a great plan that costs much less money for the people and much less money for the country.n" "This plan is a total rip, 3975, 4014
It does not work so its going to fall because economically it is a disaster for the country too.n" "But what about people where they said they had a 30 40 50 60 percent increase? And its going to be worse than that I predict on November 1st.n" "So wed better get smart and wed better start thinking properly.n" Now I want to talk about what is going on at the borders because money.., 4014, 4088
 n "Oh were going to build it.n" So listen so we have people coming to our country that should not be coming to our country , 4088, 4113
We have thousands and thousands of people from certain terrorist states from certain parts of the world that we are allowing to come into our country.n "Most of the politicians almost all of them dont even know where they are where they are being put they know nothing about these people, 4113, 4164
This could be the great Trojan Horse of all time, 4164, 4174
And Hillary wants thousands more to come in over and above Obama, 4174, 4186
Right?n" So tall -- and the wall is getting taller every day, 4186, 4198
 n If you think of this I just wrote this the Obama-Clinton foreign-policy has handed huge portions of Iraq Libya and Syria to ISIS, 4198, 4222
Huge portions, 4222, 4224
It has undermined stability in Egypt and you know what they have to do over there, 4224, 4240
And empowered Iran as never before, 4240, 4246
Iran three years ago was -- was dying, 4246, 4254
In fact when they were marching in the streets if Obama would have just encouraged them a little more it would have been taken over by the people.n "But Obama played ball with the thugs that are running it right now, 4254, 4295
Think of this think of this, 4295, 4301
Look look, 4301, 4303
Were making a deal and the deal is not made and they are dancing in the streets of Iran saying how stupid the Americans are to be making this deal.n" The leaders and in particular the leader of Iran is calling us stupid and the deal means nothing.n And yesterday I think he just said that the United States is essentially nothing.n This is our -- this is our great great partner.n "But when you have somebody -- if I was making this deal and if the other side was bragging about it the deal wasnt made Im not making that deal, 4303, 4405
Im not making it, 4405, 4409
Im walking.n" But we kept it going and we should have never ever started negotiating that deal until we had our hostages back, 4409, 4432
OK?  n "We should have walked, 4432, 4438
We should have doubled up the sanctions and walked, 4438, 4447
And they would have -- and I say it, 4447, 4456
Before the plane reached New York City or Washington you could just turn it around because theyll call you theyll say lets go, 4456, 4479
Take your hostages.n" But when you think about it you probably read today and yesterday one of the hostages was waiting for a very long period of time, 4479, 4507
Now Obama said that it had nothing to do with the hostages, 4507, 4519
That he would not do that for kidnappers.n "He would not do that for kidnapping, 4519, 4534
OK? No no think of that, 4534, 4540
You have got to think about it, 4540, 4547
He wouldnt do it -- now it was the same day right same day, 4547, 4561
We have to be exactly accurate because theyll catch us right? Same day.n" "The money came in and one of the hostages a good guy I saw him interview on television, 4561, 4592
Good guy hard time, 4592, 4596
Btu didnt he say he waited forever he waited, 4596, 4605
And somebody said nope we are waiting for either something or a plane to come in.n" And here Obama stands up yesterday and for seven minutes is telling us one thing had nothing to do with the other, 4605, 4643
Just a lie, 4643, 4646
You know at least be truthful, 4646, 4652
 n "And were talking about the same day $400 million and we could have had something that would have been a much better deal, 4652, 4676
And you know what Im all in favor of deals when it gets to nuclear, 4676, 4691
But we could have made it -- we should have walked, 4691, 4702
And we should have walked with $150 too; we have said sorry we dont have the money cant pay, 4702, 4721
We dont have the money, 4721, 4726
We owe almost $20 trillionn" "Im sorry fellas we love you we think youre the greatest guys on Earth, 4726, 4745
But we cant give you the money, 4745, 4752
We dont have it, 4752, 4756
And they will get angry and they will be upset and two days later youll be back negotiating.n" You just saved yourself $150 billion right? Hundred and -- $150 billion, 4756, 4786
 n "So we have terrorists pouring into our country we have people coming in, 4786, 4800
I dont know if you saw this in Maine -- and Maine knows because Maine is -- I was up there yesterday -- a great place, 4800, 4826
A great governor great governor, 4826, 4831
Paul is doing a great job.n" "And I think the most important issue facing civilization right now is radical Islamic terrorism, 4831, 4852
And we have a president that refuses to use the term and we have crooked Hillary who does not want to use it, 4852, 4875
Now shes being forced to use it by me.n" Did you notice she gave a speech she said I will use it, 4875, 4897
She called it I think radical Islam, 4897, 4904
But she said I will use it, 4904, 4911
I will, 4911, 4913
Just like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 4913, 4918
She called it the gold standard, 4918, 4924
It is a horror show.n "Its almost as bad or maybe its going to worse than NAFTA signed by her husband which cleaned out many of the states in our country cleaned them out from manufacturing, 4924, 4960
Moved to Mexico and other places, 4960, 4966
NAFTA a total disaster.n" NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, 4966, 4975
He never suffered the ravages because he signed it then he got out and other people did suffer with it.n "But we are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if they dont want to make a great deal for us so we get our jobs back at least a lot of them if we cant make a great deal -- and she cant do that by the way if she wanted to.n" Number one her donors would not let her, 4975, 5054
Her special interests would never let her, 5054, 5061
Her lobbyists would never let her.n Number three she could not do it anyway, 5061, 5075
Even if she wanted to.n "But were going to renegotiate, 5075, 5085
And did you hear her the other day? After years of saying how wonderful it is even though you look at New England and you look at New York state and you look at Pennsylvania and Ohio if you look at a lot of other places one of the reasons I won Indiana so big -- well one of the reasons was the great Bobby Knight OK?n" Bobby Knight in Indiana, 5085, 5156
 n "Thats gold standard right? As she said about TPP, 5156, 5166
But one of the reasons I won was because Carrier Air Conditioning was moving to Mexico from Indiana and they let go of 1400 people.n" "And Ive been talking about this and I know how to stop it and youve heard me before so easy to stop, 5166, 5213
There have to be consequences when Mexico takes our companies, 5213, 5223
And not only Mexico; there have to be consequences when China devalues its currency so that our companies can no longer compete with China even though we make better product.n" "I have friends who are manufacturers, 5223, 5259
We make better product, 5259, 5263
They cant get their product into China And when a few times arise where they can they have to pay an incredible tax beyond what anybody would even think costs, 5263, 5293
But yet we open our doors and just throw away your stuff and we lose our jobs and it is very very said.n" "But look as many know a major destination -- Maine has become a major destination for Somali refugees, 5293, 5334
We admit hundreds of thousands of refugees into the United States from many of the most dangerous and unstable regions in the world, 5334, 5357
And you are getting them here too folks you just dont know it because you just dont know.n" "Anybody in this room -- anybody in this room from a terror territory? All right a practice -- and this is a practice which will continue under Hillary Clinton except it will expand five six seven fold, 5357, 5412
I dont get it, 5412, 5416
I mean I know they will vote Democrat OK thats what I know but they will not be voting for a long time.n" I just -- I dont get it how can anybody even think this way? Now the Washington Times reported "of the Somali refugees -- the program in Minnesota -- that the effort to resettle large groups of Somali refugees is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state safety net" -- tremendous problems for safety -- "and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for the Islamic terror groupsn Arent we smart? We are having this problem across our refugee and immigration programs, 5416, 5534
Here are some of the examples -- I will give you a few examples and this came out of the Senate subcommittee just recently, 5534, 5558
"The Boston bombers" -- remember those horrible disgusting people? "The Boston bombers arrived through the political asylum process.n The younger brother applied for citizenship and was naturalized on September 11 2012, 5558, 5589
The older brother had a pending application for citizenship." And look what happened we took them in, 5589, 5606
Look what happened arent we smart?n The Moroccan national who came to the United States on a student visa was arrested for plotting to blow up a university in a federal courthouse, 5606, 5638
Great, 5638, 5639
A Uzbek refugee living in Idaho was arrested and charged with providing support to a terrorist organization in the form of teaching terror recruits how to build massive and very dangerous bombs, 5639, 5671
We let him in.n An immigrant from Syria who later applied for and received U.S, 5671, 5686
citizenship was accused by federal prosecutors of planning to go to a military base in Texas and kill three or four American soldiers execution style if possible -- more than that if at all possible.n A college student who immigrated from Somalia who later applied and received U.S, 5686, 5734
citizenship attempted to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Oregon.n An immigrant from Afghanistan who later applied for and received U.S, 5734, 5757
citizenship and a legal permanent resident from the Philippines were convicted for plotting to join Al Qaida and the Taliban in order to kill as many Americans as possible -- as many as possible.n An Iraqi immigrant who later applied for and received U.S, 5757, 5801
citizenship was arrested for lying to federal agents about pledging allegiance to ISIS his travels to Syria and how many Americans he wanted to kill.n Two immigrants from Pakistan who later applied for and received U.S, 5801, 5837
citizenship were sentenced to decades long prison sentences for plotting to detonate a bomb -- and a very big bomb in the middle of New York City.n An immigrant from Yemen who later applied for and received U.S, 5837, 5875
citizenship was arrested for trying to join ISIS, 5875, 5883
He was also charged with attempting to illegally buy firearms to try to shoot as many American military personnel as possible.n "All right folks, 5883, 5907
So I just say what are we doing? What are we doing? And Hillary Clinton wants more and more to pour in, 5907, 5929
You can almost say you know politics aside whether you are a Democrat whether you are a liberal a Republican a conservative; what are they doing? I dont care who you are what the hell are they doing? " n So we are going to have strong borders our southern border is going to be very powerful, 5929, 5986
We are going to stop the drugs from pouring into Wisconsin and every place else, 5986, 6001
 n The heroin epidemic is beyond belief, 6001, 6008
In New Hampshire a great place that is where I realized the extent of what is going on, 6008, 6026
I met with the people of New Hampshire and they tell me "the biggest problem they have is heroin." I said "it cant be with the beautiful lakes and streams it so beautiful." Right and their biggest problems heroin, 6026, 6065
I said "you have to be kidding that cant be right " and it was, 6065, 6080
Their youth is being poisoned, 6080, 6085
And then you go to Massachusetts and you go to North Carolina and South Carolina and you come here you come here -- I just left Iowa you go to Iowa and you see the tremendous problems they have with heroin and drugs that pour in from the southern border, 6085, 6135
And look heres the story we are going to have strong borders, 6135, 6147
We are going to have a wall it will be a big and powerful wall -- a big powerful wall, 6147, 6167
 n You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall a number of years ago? She wanted a wall, 6167, 6185
And the primary research as we understand it looking back not that long ago she wanted a wall, 6185, 6203
You know walls do work folks all you have to do is ask Israel, 6203, 6217
All you have to do is ask some of the nations that are in Europe right now that are building walls.n You know its sort of interesting Obama talks about "there will be no wall." But in the White House which he just said which is true they want to build essentially a wall they want to build a fence a lot bigger and a lot higher and a lot stronger.n You know it is interesting, 6217, 6293
I say "dont build that fence right dont build that fence" because they say "walls dont work" -- fences dont work dont build that fence."n "When Hillary doesnt want to let you have your guns she is surrounded by people like this that have more firepower on them than any human beings on earth and I think she doesnt want to have guns, 6293, 6356
I think that all of her bodyguards and all of her Secret Service should immediately give up their weapons, 6356, 6375
" n OK I mean it, 6375, 6381
They should immediately give up their weapons, 6381, 6388
They should immediately give up those weapons and if somebody comes at you with a gun you just try to talk them out of it I guess, 6388, 6415
You got to do some quick talking.n "You got to do some quick talking Hillary, 6415, 6430
I dont think even Hillary with her phony lies and disgusting habits I dont think Hillary could get away with that one, 6430, 6452
" n So we are going to have a little contrast, 6452, 6463
And I did this very quickly but it is so simple Hillary wants to raise taxes Trump is going to lower taxes very substantially the biggest tax decrease of all on business and on person.n Hillary wants to significantly expand regulations, 6463, 6504
 Trump is going to get rid of many many many regulations, 6504, 6515
 n "Which by the way are stopping your businesses both small and big from succeeding from expanding and more than anything from starting, 6515, 6538
You cant start a business today the regulations are so onerous and horrible.n" Hillary wants to shut down energy production, 6538, 6558
 " Trump wants to expand it significantly, 6558, 6565
And well start paying off our debt, 6565, 6572
" n Hillary wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment take away your right, 6572, 6586
  Donald Trump will protect it more so than any president that has ever served, 6586, 6600
 n Crooked Hillary wants far left activities judges forced over there by Bernie and by Pocahontas, 6600, 6616
 n Who will destroy our Constitution, 6616, 6622
I want judges who will support and defend our Constitution, 6622, 6632
 n As close by the way to Justice Scalia who was great as we could get OK?  n Hillary wants to open our borders just open them up because her special interests and donors want it that way, 6632, 6670
There are reasons I understand that, 6670, 6676
I want to totally secure our borders, 6676, 6683
But I want people to come in, 6683, 6690
But they come in through a process and they come in legally, 6690, 6702
 n Hillary wants to invade foreign countries, 6702, 6709
You ever see the one where she says "Donald Trump with the nuclear" -- Im -- I didnt want the war in Iraq, 6709, 6732
And Im on record, 6732, 6736
I didnt want the war in Iraq, 6736, 6743
I didnt want all of -- what theyve done, 6743, 6752
And I said if you read Esquire Magazine from a long time ago youll see everything I said was exactly right, 6752, 6773
Its going to de-stabilize the Middle East.n "I said the meanest toughest group of people the people that hate the United States and its people the most theyre going to take it over, 6773, 6806
Thats exactly whats happening, 6806, 6810
Theyre taking over the oil theyre taking over the land theyre taking over everything, 6810, 6824
I didnt want it but Im always being accused like the war hog they think Im a tough guy the war hog, 6824, 6846
Right?n" "They think she wants to be tough with Russia, 6846, 6856
So she said well Donald Trump likes Putin, 6856, 6864
I dont know Putin folks, 6864, 6869
I dont know, 6869, 6872
I hope I like him I hope he likes me because Id love to get along with Russia, 6872, 6890
OK? " n "Love to, 6890, 6895
But I dont know, 6895, 6899
But she goes Donald Trump Donald Trump -- think about it -- wants to befriend Putin and other things she said right? And Im saying to myself whats wrong with that? Thats good.n" "But shes going to be the tough one see? Shes going to be the tough one, 6899, 6948
Shes going to play with nuclear weapons you know? They have all the nukes nice nukes, 6948, 6964
Shes going to be the tough one.n" "Ill tell you what you put her in the office of the president -- you know she hates Putin and Putin hates her right? Thats what I hear, 6964, 6999
No no -- Putin probably doesnt respect her more than anything else, 6999, 7011
But Putin hates her, 7011, 7015
But shes going to be tough, 7015, 7021
Were going to be tough with Russia -- oh were going to be tough right? Let me tell you were in a different world today folks, 7021, 7047
Were in a different world.n" "But she makes it sound like Im this tough guy that will have a temperament, 7047, 7067
You know she uses the word -- you know who gave her the word? Her people that write the speeches well say Trump with a temperament.n" "They said Trump in a speech with tweets, 7067, 7101
Ive got -- Ive got between Facebook and Twitter like almost 21 22 million people, 7101, 7116
Its an asset its an asset, 7116, 7122
I tweet well, 7122, 7125
But -- but she said -- she made the statement during her speech you know I heard it barely because I was falling asleep you couldnt watch it, 7125, 7153
" n "All right, 7153, 7157
So remember that one, 7157, 7161
Hillary wants to invade foreign countries, 7161, 7167
Look at Libya, 7167, 7170
Look at that, 7170, 7173
We did a great job there, 7173, 7179
You know a spot hit on Gaddafi maybe but I mean even that what the hell do we get out of this? Its a disaster, 7179, 7204
Then you have Benghazi then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS -- then you have ISIS taking over the oil large portions of the oil, 7204, 7231
And its some of the finest oil in the world, 7231, 7241
And you have ISIS grabbing it.n" "We dont know what were doing, 7241, 7253
We have people that dont know what were doing, 7253, 7262
We have people that militarily -- in fact they said well who is your military consultants? And I give them names, 7262, 7283
But theyre not working now you know theyre not working now, 7283, 7294
And I said of course theyre not working now look what working now people have gotten us, 7294, 7311
Havoc who the hell wants the people who are working now? I mean.., 7311, 7324
" n "You know a lot of its common sense and a lot of its instinct and she has very bad judgment shes got no instinct whatsoever, 7324, 7351
And when I was asked on one of the big networks about NATO they said what do you think of NATO? Now you know its not like it was my primary subject in all fairness, 7351, 7386
Ive only been doing this for 12 months, 7386, 7394
Now its actually almost 14 months hard to believe right?n" "But NATO -- so I said I know enough, 7394, 7413
And sometimes knowing a little is better than knowing too much, 7413, 7424
You understand you cant see the forest through the trees right? So I said NATO in my opinion is obsolete because its not covering terrorism, 7424, 7449
Obsolete for that reason and also you have many countries that arent paying their fair share theyre not paying what theyre supposed to be paying, 7449, 7474
" n "And were protecting those guys and were supposed to get into World War III for all these countries that arent paying their fair share, 7474, 7500
And even the commander of NATO -- and I so respect what he did, 7500, 7514
He came out the other day and he said Donald Trump is right we have cut you see thats right did you see the letter -- the big story? Donald Trump is right, 7514, 7547
Im sure Obama was thrilled when he saw that, 7547, 7556
" n "Donald Trump is right; you have countries that arent paying, 7556, 7568
And he said how he goes in and he talks to them, 7568, 7580
He says look youve got to pay your bills, 7580, 7589
I have budgets -- which is true, 7589, 7596
And I have to go back to Congress and I have to say whats happening.n" They dont pay their bills though because people dont ask properly, 7596, 7622
And they probably say to the president or whoever may handle the country, 7622, 7635
"Sir we owe the United States millions of dollars, 7635, 7644
Were ready to pay." Oh have they asked for the money? No, 7644, 7656
Theyll pay OKn "But I will say the commander of NATO said I was right, 7656, 7671
And then you have these people back here -- stupid people -- right here, 7671, 7685
They said Donald Trump -- now theyre the worst, 7685, 7694
Theyre the worst, 7694, 7697
They said Donald Trump -- Donald Trump doesnt like NATO, 7697, 7707
He is going to abandon NATO, 7707, 7713
Thats not what I said, 7713, 7718
I said theyve got to pay, 7718, 7724
Theyve got to pay.n" "Now you have to walk, 7724, 7733
You may have to walk, 7733, 7738
But theyve got to pay, 7738, 7743
Were going to get in World War III for all these countries that are laughing at the stupidity of the United States right? No theyve got to pay, 7743, 7771
And they probably will in all fairness.n" "But Hillary said about Japan -- because Japan were defending Japan you know that right? Now in all fairness before I came alone put yourself back three years ago, 7771, 7807
Did anybody know that we defend Japan? Raise your hand who knew, 7807, 7819
All right theres about 12 percent.n" "Not bad, 7819, 7827
I think some of you are lying OK? I think some of you are related to Hillary Rodham Clinton, 7827, 7846
I think some of you are lying, 7846, 7853
But we defend Japan and a man comes up general or something a few months ago I remember so vividly, 7853, 7873
And he said at a news conference because they were embarrassed because I kept saying theyve got to pay their way, 7873, 7894
And if they dont -- if they dont you always have to be prepared to walk you have to do that.n" You know we dont want to do that I understand the reason, 7894, 7927
Itd be nice to have them but you know this isnt again 40 years ago, 7927, 7942
We owe $20 trillion, 7942, 7946
Were defending all these -- we defend Japan, 7946, 7954
We defend Germany, 7954, 7957
We defend Saudi Arabia, 7957, 7961
You think they have the money to pay -- how about we have military bases that we rent -- we pay rent to Saudi Arabia to protect them? No, 7961, 7990
No think of it, 7990, 7994
Think of it think of the stupidity, 7994, 8001
Think of the stupidity, 8001, 8005
So this general comes up has a news conference a few months ago, 8005, 8018
And he said "Mr, 8018, 8022
Trump doesnt understand that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend them."n So a reporter goes up who I think is there and said to me "Mr, 8022, 8052
Trump wed like your comment, 8052, 8057
They say that Japan is paying 50 percent of the cost to defend." And I said why arent they paying 100 percent? The reporter said OK." Not a bad question, 8057, 8087
Now heres the problem with the Hillary -- Hillary rotten Clinton, 8087, 8098
Heres the problem, 8098, 8101
 n "Here is -- thats why she changed her last -- thats why she doesnt want to use the name anymore because everybody was saying that, 8101, 8127
I dont know, 8127, 8130
Ive been saying it.n" "But look here is -- here is why it doesnt work for Hillary, 8130, 8147
She saw that I said that we have to get reimbursed for our costs at least right?n" "Japan economic behemoth, 8147, 8167
Germany -- see how well theyre doing -- economic behemoth, 8167, 8177
Saudi Arabia nothing but money.n" "They were making $1 billion a day with their high oil prices now theyre making a fortune the same thing, 8177, 8202
Economic behemoth, 8202, 8204
Why are defending them and why arent we being fully reimbursed? Now if we do that your budget already is starting to look real good OK, 8204, 8230
You know you have budgets so we losing our assurance; we have an $800 billion trade deficit folks.n" We trade with companies, 8230, 8252
We have a deficit with other countries think of it -- $800 billion a year, 8252, 8267
Trade deficit, 8267, 8269
Do we make the deals? no.n "With China $505 billion trade deficit, 8269, 8281
And they cheat us because they devalue their currency all the time, 8281, 8293
Whenever it gets a little bit tough devalue devalue and our companies cant compete with that, 8293, 8309
Right?n" "So heres the thing, 8309, 8314
So Hillary says about Japan how dare he not not stay with our allies how dare he not do that?n" "I will never abandon our allies ever ever ever, 8314, 8343
Now how do you negotiate when youre telling somebody will never going to leave? We may have to leave.n" "Look Japan has problems because you have the maniac in North Korea making missiles, 8343, 8376
But I mean you know so well get it.n" "Now South Korea it is an economic behemoth, 8376, 8393
You cant buy television that is not made in South Korea except Sony which is made in Japan which has sort of lost its way, 8393, 8418
Whether it is LG or Samsung, 8418, 8424
I order thousands of television sets; you cant buy them in the United States, 8424, 8438
Id love to, 8438, 8441
Show me one company, 8441, 8445
One of the pundits said they do make them, 8445, 8454
Theres a company.n" "And he showed me its a little company, 8454, 8465
What they do is all the parts come in for -- from all over the world; they put them together and they give you a television that doesnt work and nobody ever heard of it, 8465, 8500
" n And then I put it into a luxury hotel and everybody complains right?n "So you cant say to people when youre negotiating -- because were talking about tremendous billions and billions of dollars, 8500, 8535
