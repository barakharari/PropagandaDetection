"Hello! Thank you! Thank you so much, 0, 7
Thank you, 7, 9
Thank you so very much, 9, 14
Wow what – what a wonderful welcome, 14, 21
It is great to be here in Fort Pierce in this beautiful theater, 21, 34
I love being in the Sunshine State, 34, 41
I really want to recognize a few people: U.S, 41, 50
Congresswoman Lois Frankel is here as you saw Randy Perkins a candidate for Congress Kim Johnson chair of the St, 50, 70
Lucie County Commission Larry Lee Jr, 70, 76
state representative, 76, 78
Everyone all of the elected officials all of the students and young people it is wonderful to be with you, 78, 98
And I want to thank Eileen for her introduction, 98, 107
We know how hard that nurses like Eileen work and now that she is retired she is volunteering for our campaign, 107, 128
This woman never quit and Eileen we are so glad you are on our team, 128, 143
"I am grateful to all of the elected officials all of the commissioners the county commissioners Martin County St, 143, 162
Lucie for all you do for the community but especially for all you did this summer to clean up the algae that polluted the water that threatened wildlife and made life hard for local residents and businesses, 162, 199
This is a serious and complicated problem isnt it for the entire Treasure Coast, 199, 213
And it is a reminder if we needed it how important good leadership is, 213, 227
So I thank all the leaders for their commitment." Now there are just 39 days between now and November 8th, 227, 247
Just 39 days left in the most important election in our lifetimes, 247, 259
"Weve got to make every single day count, 259, 267
We have to get more people registered to vote get more people committed to turn out to vote, 267, 285
We have to drive home the stakes in this election: stronger families safer communities and an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top, 285, 312
And underneath all of the rhetoric and the coverage and the back and forth this campaign really comes down to two questions, 312, 334
What kind of future we want for ourselves our kids and our grandkids and how do we make it a reality?" Now as I said it the other night – how many of you saw the debate? Well as I said I now have two grandchildren and no offense to anybody the two most wonderful amazing extraordinary, 334, 391
A little girl and a little boy, 391, 398
So I think a lot about the future, 398, 406
And you may have noticed that my opponent and I have different views about – well nearly everything when it gets right down to it – not just about what makes America great because I think America already is great – but about what we should do to make it even greater and about that basic question about how progress happens at all, 406, 469
"My opponent believes in what I call a strongman approach, 469, 479
He stood on that stage at his convention and described a hopeless broken nation, 479, 493
I am sorry I am looking at you, 493, 501
I dont see that, 501, 505
That in no way resembles the strong vibrant America I know, 505, 516
And heres what he said, 516, 521
He said I alone can fix it, 521, 528
I alone?" "Well we have learned that thats his way, 528, 538
One person getting supreme power and exercising it ruthlessly, 538, 547
Thats why he admires dictators like Vladimir Putin so much, 547, 557
But thats not how change happens in America, 557, 565
Its never just one person not even someone as powerful as the president, 565, 578
Every good our country has ever achieved has always happened because people have worked together to make it a reality, 578, 598
Not just the wealthy or the powerful – all of us." We see that every day across America and I bet many of you have been a part of it, 598, 628
Maybe you taught kids to read right? Or cleaned up your local park or the beach maybe you have organized a cancer walk or you have run a food drive, 628, 658
Whatever it is chances are you have done something to serve your community, 658, 671
And by extension your country, 671, 676
"How many of you – just think back over your lives – how many of you have performed some kind of service of some sort for your community for other people, 676, 707
The reason I know you have is because tens and tens of millions of Americans do some kind of volunteering in your hometowns every single year, 707, 733
Its one of the best things about the American people, 733, 743
We are doers, 743, 746
We dont just shrug our shoulders when we see something that needs fixing we dont get resigned or pathetic or blame other people and turn on each other to find scapegoats, 746, 777
We roll up our sleeves we get to work to try to make things better in our neighborhood our community our city our state our country." This has been our story the American story since the beginning of our nation and it is still going strong today, 777, 824
Now for many Americans including a lot of you here serving our country has included serving in our Armed Forces, 824, 844
People are starting to call out their services! "There is no greater service or sacrifice and we are grateful to our men and women in uniform to their families and our veterans every single day, 844, 879
But whats so great is that national service can take many different forms and its something that I believe in so deeply that every stage of our lives gives us the chance from grade school through grandparenthood to find a way to give back." "Weve got folks here today from AmeriCorps which my husband created back in 1993 and Ill tell you to this day it is one of his proudest achievements, 879, 951
Because very day AmeriCorps volunteers are out there, 951, 959
Theyre building houses responding to natural disasters helping people with disabilities find jobs find safe places to live and next week on October 7th AmeriCorps will celebrate a major milestone: their one-millionth member, 959, 992
Ill tell you Bill is really excited about this and so am I, 992, 1005
And by the way AmeriCorps has one of the best swearing in pledges I have ever heard, 1005, 1022
Heres how it starts: I will get things done for America, 1022, 1033
Isnt that great? I think we should make that a national slogan." "Now we also have folks here today from City Year which is part of AmeriCorps, 1033, 1060
And every day theyre working with students who are risk of dropping out of school, 1060, 1075
Theyre tutoring and mentoring and running after school clubs – all to help young people really discover how capable they really are and to be empowered and to stay in school, 1075, 1106
Im really grateful to them." We also have people here today from the Peace Corps which represents the best of America to the world, 1106, 1130
Peace Corps volunteers are teaching English in Kosovo staffing health centers in Nicaragua supporting farmers in Nepal distributing malaria nets in Uganda, 1130, 1152
Both as First Lady and as Secretary of State I got to see the results of their work first hand, 1152, 1172
They are making the world a healthier more prosperous and more peaceful place, 1172, 1185
Now maybe not all of you have been a part of one of these programs but I know you serve in different ways, 1185, 1208
"Maybe you volunteer through your school or with your church or synagogue, 1208, 1220
Maybe you find through faith-based opportunities as I did when I was a teenager service opportunities, 1220, 1236
Because for many Americans service is part of our faith, 1236, 1246
My running mate Tim Kaine volunteered in Honduras with Jesuits as a young man and it changed his life, 1246, 1265
Or maybe your whole family volunteers together Bill and Chelsea and I every holiday season would work at a food bank back in Arkansas, 1265, 1289
However you serve it feels good doesnt it? To be part of something bigger than ourselves, 1289, 1305
To take our time and labor and put it towards something good that can happen in our country and the world." "And you know something very interesting? Service makes us happier it makes us healthier and there are studies proving that, 1305, 1346
Its not just how we feel theyve actually followed people, 1346, 1356
It can also help us find our next job or our true calling in life, 1356, 1371
Its a smart way to use our greatest asset in life our people, 1371, 1384
And service does something important for us as a society, 1384, 1394
Too often we Americans can become separated from each other and I think a lot of people are feeling this way during this election." "Its easy to surround ourselves with only those that think like us talk like us look like us read the same news as us thats understandable to an extent, 1394, 1447
But it comes with a cost because it magnifies our differences which then makes it harder to put those differences aside when our community or country needs us, 1447, 1475
There arent many places where people of all ages all races all backgrounds all beliefs come together in common cause, 1475, 1495
But service is one of them and thats one of the reasons I think its so valuable because in addition to the good work it does it helps us reconnect with each other to feel more a part of our shared American life." "I believe that one of the jobs of President is to encourage more service to help more Americans answer President Kennedys call, 1495, 1560
You know it: Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country." "But sometimes its hard to figure out, 1560, 1587
How do you make a difference especially with everything else going on in our lives? And too often volunteering becomes something only people with lots of time and financial security can do, 1587, 1619
But thats not how it should be, 1619, 1626
Everyone should be able to contribute." "So what if we as a country made it easier for everybody to do that for everybody to give back? What if we created more service opportunities for Americans of all ages invested in programs that work and encouraged entrepreneurs to add a social component to their businesses? What if we strengthened the culture of service in America so it wasnt just something that we did one day a year but it became a regular part of our lives, 1626, 1711
I think that would reflect our values and would tap into something so great about America." "I talk a lot about how America is an exceptional nation, 1711, 1738
Were not exceptional just be-cause of the size of our military or the size of our economy, 1738, 1755
Were exceptional because of the generosity and ingenuity of our people." "Way back nearly 200 years ago a Frenchman came to the United States his name was Alexis de Tocqueville, 1755, 1785
He was travelling around trying to figure out What is this new place called America? They fought a revolution, 1785, 1804
Who are they? And he saw how we had set up our government and we had three branches and everything that our founders really put into place, 1804, 1831
But the thing that made the biggest impression on him was our spirit of volunteerism that made a democracy as diverse and ambitious as ours possible, 1831, 1857
If Im elected president this fall I want to build on that strength by making a major push in support of more national service, 1857, 1881
So heres what I plan to do." "First lets triple AmeriCorps, 1881, 1892
That was the goal of my friend and the great Senator Ted Kennedy, 1892, 1905
It was laid out in a law named in his honor the Edward M, 1905, 1919
Kennedy Serve America Act, 1919, 1923
Its finally time we get it done, 1923, 1930
Every year there are hundreds of thousands of more applications for AmeriCorps than there are spots in the program so if we grow the program from 75000 annual members to 250000 were going to give more people who already want to serve the chance to do so." "Then I want to double the college scholarships that AmeriCorps members earn through their service and I want to find ways for more students to get college credit for service because I know too many talented committed young people who pass up serving with AmeriCorps because with their student loans they cant afford it, 1930, 2031
So lets lighten that burden, 2031, 2036
If you do national service we will begin a program to forgive your loans because you are giving back to your country, 2036, 2058
And lets keep working to the ultimate goal of making it possible for any American to serve full time if they want to." "Now second lets grow the Peace Corps, 2058, 2088
Since President Kennedy launched it 55 years ago its given nearly a quarter of a million Americans the experience of a lifetime and its fostered friendship and cooperation between Americans and people in more than 100 nations, 2088, 2125
Weve got to do more of that in the world today, 2125, 2136
We need more Americans of all ages around the world showing our values serving people, 2136, 2151
So lets make it possible for more Americans to be a part of this extraordinary program." "Third lets expand service opportunities for people of all ages, 2151, 2177
Right? Now lets be fair the younger generation is way ahead on this, 2177, 2190
Ive talked to so many young people who are deeply thoughtful about how your lives impact others and the world, 2190, 2210
Service isnt just something to do to check a box before graduation it really is woven into your lives, 2210, 2229
And many who are just getting started in your careers say that having a social impact is more important to you than getting a job that yes may pay a salary but doesnt give you any meaning or purpose in your lives." "Now I also want to get older Americans more involved, 2229, 2281
Service isnt something only students and young people do, 2281, 2290
I know that, 2290, 2293
So I intend to make sure that 10 percent of AmeriCorps slots go to Americans over the age of 55, 2293, 2313
Lets give people an encore opportunity after theyve ended their formal careers so they can apply a lifetime of knowledge and experience to a stronger community." "And finally I want to create a new means for people to serve in serious meaningful ways without a full time commitment, 2313, 2361
AmeriCorps is a full time commitment, 2361, 2367
The Peace Corps is a full time commitment, 2367, 2375
The Armed Forces are a full time commitment, 2375, 2383
But the Armed Forces has another model, 2383, 2390
The Reserves – right? It gives people the chance to make a high impact contribution while still building careers and pursuing their dreams in other ways, 2390, 2416
So lets do something like that in the civilian space, 2416, 2426
Lets call it the National Service Reserve." "And heres the idea, 2426, 2437
If you join the National Service Reserve you will receive some basic training just like you would in the military reserves and then when your city or state needs you youll get the call, 2437, 2471
Say a natural disaster strikes and the Red Cross needs all hands on deck, 2471, 2485
Or maybe like the crisis in Flint and clean water has to be distributed every day to a lot of families, 2485, 2506
Or maybe your city launches a major public health campaign to reduce drug abuse or promote mental health, 2506, 2524
You will then be sent into action, 2524, 2531
Now some of these assignments maybe just be for a few days a month some might be longer term, 2531, 2550
But they will directly address a vital need in your own community." "And one of the other advantages is you can help meet that need while still being a full-time student having a job taking care of your family, 2550, 2589
You wont have to make service your only priority, 2589, 2598
Our goal is 5 million people spread across all 50 states and we will have an open door to people of all ages but we want to put a special focus on people under 30 whove said again and again they want to have a bigger impact in their communities but they cant leave their jobs understandably, 2598, 2655
Well work with governors and mayors Republicans and Democrats because I want this to be a true bipartisan public-private partnership." "I also want to include businesses colleges and universities who have unique resources to offer, 2655, 2690
And because we want workers and students to know that as they make this contribution their schools and their employers will have their backs, 2690, 2714
I really think a National Service Reserve could make a difference for cities and states, 2714, 2729
Theres so much work to be done and so many people who want to help do it, 2729, 2746
So lets bridge that divide get people working together in ways that can help communities." "Now I dont think youll hear anything about this from my opponent, 2746, 2773
And you know what? I think thats a shame because national service has always been a bipartisan goal, 2773, 2791
Of course President Kennedy started the Peace Corps and my husband started AmeriCorps – but President Nixon signed the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, 2791, 2814
President George H.W, 2814, 2817
Bush created the White House Office of National Service, 2817, 2826
And both President George W, 2826, 2831
Bush and President Obama have been huge champions of service, 2831, 2841
This should be something that we all can get behind, 2841, 2851
And when you listen to whats being said in this campaign it can be discouraging right? It can seem hard to find any common ground so it makes it even more important that we come together where whenever we can, 2851, 2891
Now I am well aware that candidates dont usually focus on national service in the final stretch of a hotly fought presidential election, 2891, 2914
Some might say Well hey my gosh youve only got 39 days to go, 2914, 2928
Why arent you just out there beating up on your opponent and doing everything to get the vote out and all the rest of it? Well Ill do that but – Ive been thinking about this for a long time and I did not want this campaign to end without talking about it because it means a lot to me, 2928, 2988
Im trying to end the campaign focusing on issues that are really close to my heart – and this is one of them." Thank you! "For me service is really all about fulfilling the instruction of my Methodist faith and you can see part of the creed I like to follow behind me: Do all the good you can in all the ways you can in all the places you can at all the times you can to all the people you can as long as ever you can, 2988, 3077
Now Ive carried those words with me ever since I heard them as a little girl and its an idea that really got into my head and my heart, 3077, 3106
But you know whats kept me going are the people that Ive met, 3106, 3119
And in a country founded on liberty and equality I cant think of a more important notion than every one of us is valuable, 3119, 3143
We all deserve respect, 3143, 3147
We all should listen to each other, 3147, 3154
We all can make our mark on the world, 3154, 3163
And when we come together in common purpose we can do so much more than we could ever do on our own." "Thats why Stronger Together is more than just a slogan, 3163, 3195
Its a course of action, 3195, 3200
So heres what I want to do, 3200, 3207
I want you to hear me pledge that this will be a vital aspect of my presidency, 3207, 3224
And I want you to help me bring our nation together – to solve our problems strengthen our communities, 3224, 3243
To join with people across America who care about service because this speaks to both what is great and good about the United States, 3243, 3267
America is great because we are good, 3267, 3274
There are lots of examples, 3274, 3279
We are going to be putting examples up on my website of people who have served and who are inspirations, 3279, 3299
But I want everybody here to know that it can be done, 3299, 3311
We can do more and we can provide the opportunities to enlist more people." "There are so many examples in this community and communities across America – 39 days left, 3311, 3341
This is the choice: do we lift each other up or do we tear each other down? Do we listen and respect each other or do we scapegoat point fingers and insult each other? Well Ill tell you what side Im going to be on and with your help were going to demonstrate on November 8th what kind of country we really are." Thank you and God bless you!" , 3341, 3410
