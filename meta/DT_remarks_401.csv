"Its so great to be here tonight, 0, 7
I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker Chairman Reince Priebus and Mayor Rudy Giuliani." We are at a decisive moment in this election, 7, 36
Last week I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country, 36, 50
Yesterday I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism, 50, 61
Tonight I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness, 61, 79
Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city and across this country for their service and sacrifice in difficult times, 79, 104
The violence riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace, 104, 130
Law and order must be restored, 130, 136
It must be restored for the sake of all but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities, 136, 157
The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods, 157, 171
It is their jobs their homes their schools and communities which will suffer as a result, 171, 187
There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct, 187, 195
Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration, 195, 213
The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton is a false one, 213, 238
The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police the problem is that there are not enough police, 238, 261
More law enforcement more community engagement more effective policing is what our country needs, 261, 275
Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners she is against the police, 275, 288
You know it and I know it, 288, 295
Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and many other places within our country, 295, 336
They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America, 336, 345
Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives – whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore – and foment further unrest we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities, 345, 386
"During the last 72 hours while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded, 386, 412
More than 2600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year and almost 4000 killed in President Obamas hometown area since his presidency began." How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers? The war on our police must end, 412, 459
It must end now, 459, 463
The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety, 463, 492
Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter the looter the violent disruptor, 492, 509
Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets, 509, 533
Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus, 533, 541
Or the young child walking home from school, 541, 549
For every one violent protestor there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night, 549, 579
My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim, 579, 589
Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty high crime and lost opportunities, 589, 620
I care too much about my country to let that happen, 620, 631
We all care too much about our country to let that happen, 631, 643
Good policing saves lives, 643, 647
My dear friend Rudy Giuliani knows a thing or two about this, 647, 659
The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent, 659, 678
Think of how many families were saved how much heartache was prevented when police were put into communities and criminals were removed, 678, 700
"Imagine how many lives could have been saved all across this country if Democratic politicians hadnt blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City? Ill make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee and all across this country." "Its easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force, 700, 762
I believe all Americans not just the powerful are entitled to security." "Hillary Clinton has had her chance, 762, 780
She failed, 780, 782
Now its time for new leadership." The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most, 782, 797
There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers gang members and felons to prey on innocent people, 797, 814
It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American – and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very very long time, 814, 856
I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future, 856, 876
It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths, 876, 890
The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community, 890, 900
Democratic crime policies education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime more broken homes and more poverty, 900, 919
"Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee a city run by Democrats for decade after decade, 919, 938
Last year killings in this city increased by 69 percent plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings, 938, 955
18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims, 955, 964
The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average, 964, 974
Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job, 974, 992
Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty, 992, 1003
55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil, 1003, 1024
There is only a 60% graduation rate and its one of the worst public school systems in the country." 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit, 1024, 1071
To every voter in Milwaukee to every voter living in every inner city or every forgotten stretch of our society I am running to offer you a better future, 1071, 1100
"The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted, 1100, 1111
Theyve just assumed theyll get your support and done nothing in return for it, 1111, 1125
Its time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes and its time to rebuild the inner cities of America – and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system." "Im not part of the corrupt system, 1125, 1165
In fact the corrupt system is trying to stop me, 1165, 1175
Ive been paying my own way, 1175, 1181
The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors the consultants the power brokers and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system." The other party – the Democratic Party – nominated the personification of special interest corruption, 1181, 1225
The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests, 1225, 1250
I am running to listen to your voice to hear your cries for help, 1250, 1264
The quiet voices in our society not the loudest demonstrators need to have their demands heard, 1264, 1280
Jobs, 1280, 1281
Safety, 1281, 1282
Opportunity, 1282, 1283
Fair and equal representation, 1283, 1287
"We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes not as individual human beings worthy of a better future, 1287, 1320
She doesnt care at all about the hurting people of this country or the suffering she has caused them." "The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party, 1320, 1353
Its time to break with the failures of the past – I want to offer Americans a new future." It is time for rule by the people not rule by special interests, 1353, 1385
Every insider getting rich off of our broken system is throwing money at Hillary Clinton, 1385, 1400
The hedge fund managers the Wall Street investors the professional political class, 1400, 1412
"Its the powerful protecting the powerful." Insiders fighting for insiders, 1412, 1422
I am fighting for you, 1422, 1427
"When we talk about the insider who are we talking about? Its the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests, 1427, 1448
Its the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill, 1448, 1462
Its the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence, 1462, 1476
The insiders also include the media executives anchors and journalists in Washington Los Angeles and New York City who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change." Every day you pick up a newspaper or turn on the nightly news and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign, 1476, 1538
Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign, 1538, 1548
Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign, 1548, 1558
"I wear their opposition as a badge of honor, 1558, 1567
Because it means I am fighting for REAL change not just partisan change, 1567, 1580
I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country, 1580, 1601
The media-donor-political complex thats bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of by and for the people." The leadership class in Washington D.C, 1601, 1629
of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years has abandoned the people of this country, 1629, 1647
I am going to give the people their voice back, 1647, 1657
Think about it, 1657, 1660
The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result, 1660, 1683
The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another, 1683, 1703
The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another, 1703, 1722
"Arent you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?" "Arent you tired of big media big businesses and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?" Are you ready for change? Are you ready for leadership that puts you the American people first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first? "Lets talk about what this means for the inner cities of America, 1722, 1794
Its time to break through the television noise the entrenched interests, 1794, 1805
I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system – a lot of people whove created our problems – will lose a lot of their contracts and their special gigs if African-American voters and all minority voters support my campaign." "Its time to stop making the special interests rich, 1805, 1857
Its time to make the American people rich." I am going to Make America Wealthy again, 1857, 1873
The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years and run them into financial ruin, 1873, 1894
"Theyve ruined the schools." "Theyve driven out the jobs." "Theyve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable." "Violent crime has risen 17% in Americas 50 largest cities last year, 1894, 1926
Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent, 1926, 1937
Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore, 1937, 1945
They are up more than 50% in Washington D.C." This is the future offered by Hillary Clinton, 1945, 1962
More poverty more crime and more of the same, 1962, 1971
The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine, 1971, 1984
It is time for a different future, 1984, 1991
Here is what I am proposing, 1991, 1997
"First on immigration, 1997, 2000
No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clintons immigration policies than the African-American community, 2000, 2018
Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants taking jobs directly from low-income Americans, 2018, 2038
I will secure our border protect our workers and improve jobs and wages in your community, 2038, 2054
We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values who support our Constitution and who love all of our people." On trade I am going to renegotiate NAFTA stand up to China withdraw from the TPP and protect every last American job, 2054, 2101
On taxes I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores – and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave, 2101, 2145
I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee, 2145, 2170
Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas, 2170, 2178
I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States, 2178, 2192
On education it is time to have school choice merit pay for teachers and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers, 2192, 2219
We are going to put students and parents first, 2219, 2228
Hillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy, 2228, 2250
I am going to allow charter schools to thrive and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education and a good-paying job, 2250, 2277
On crime I am going to support more police in our communities appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country pursue strong enforcement of federal laws and I am going to break up the gangs the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods, 2277, 2321
To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end, 2321, 2342
On healthcare we are going to get rid of Obamacare – which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases – and give choice to patients and consumers, 2342, 2368
Aetna just today announced they are dropping out – as are many of the major insurance companies, 2368, 2385
"On government corruption I am going to restore honor to our government, 2385, 2397
Weve seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton the mass email deletions the pay-for-play at the State Department the profiteering the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense, 2397, 2427
Weve seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme risk innocent American lives and bring dishonor onto our government." In my Administration I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information, 2427, 2468
No one will be above the law, 2468, 2475
I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve, 2475, 2501
I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office or from any entity tied to a foreign government, 2501, 2539
This is all just the beginning, 2539, 2545
"We are going to make this a government of the people once again, 2545, 2558
This is our chance to take back power from all the people whove taken it from you, 2558, 2575
The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you with your vote can take away their power and return it to your family and community." These are tough times, 2575, 2614
But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before, 2614, 2625
To do this we are going to need a fighter in the White House, 2625, 2639
I will be your fighter, 2639, 2644
"To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country to win trade in our country you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina, 2644, 2669
Hillary Clinton doesnt have that strength and stamina, 2669, 2677
She cannot win for you." Most importantly she has bad judgment, 2677, 2688
Bad judgment on terrorism bad judgement on foreign policy bad judgment on trade, 2688, 2701
"The only individuals shes ever delivered for is her donors – not the people." Ive said it before and Ill say it again, 2701, 2724
My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge, 2724, 2734
Her pledge reads: "Im With Her" I choose to recite a different pledge, 2734, 2747
My pledge reads: "Im With You – the American people." I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally protected equally and honored equally, 2747, 2773
We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future of security prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people, 2773, 2810
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House, 2810, 2826
We will once again be a country of law and order and a country of great success, 2826, 2843
"To every parent who dreams for their children and to every child who dreams for their future I say these words to you tonight: Im with you I will fight for you and I will win for you." Together We will make America strong again, 2843, 2888
We will make American safe again, 2888, 2894
And we will make America great again, 2894, 2901
Thank you and God Bless, 2901, 2906
