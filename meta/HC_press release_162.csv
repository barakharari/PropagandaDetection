"He is fighting to make sure nothing stands in the way of his daughters achieving their dreams." "I know I know, 0, 21
Youre used to hearing your dad say that as long as you work hard and have faith nothing is impossible, 21, 41
But sometimes it can be hard to even dream of doing something nobody like you has ever done, 41, 59
Trust me I know." Growing up I never expected to see a politician who looked like me become president, 59, 78
But in 2008 I watched in awe as Barack Obama ascended to the highest political office in the country, 78, 97
"Now Ive always believed in my ability to do whatever I set my mind to, 97, 112
Grandma and Papa did a very good job of instilling that in me from the time I was your age, 112, 132
But when President Obama took office I felt like I really could do anything—truly in a tangible way I could feel in my heart." "I could never have gotten to where I am if people didnt kick down some doors ahead of me, 132, 175
Because of that I feel a duty to kick down doors for other people." "When I was 29 Governor Hodges appointed me to his cabinet, 175, 200
He gave me the opportunity of a lifetime and I used my position to lift up voices that werent being heard." I worked hard while there to bring as many women as possible onto my staff, 200, 236
At one point we had an all-female staff and many of those women have gone on to do remarkable things, 236, 256
I did that for you two, 256, 262
I wanted to do everything I could to make the world a better place for you even before you were born, 262, 283
"Of course both of you know women are capable of accomplishing anything, 283, 295
Your mother is the perfect example of that, 295, 303
But sometimes things you cant control block you from achieving your dreams." "I dont want you girls to have to wait until youre an adult to have the feeling I had in 2008, 303, 336
I want you to grow up knowing—not just believing but KNOWING—you can be anything you want even president of the United States." "Bethie getting to watch you talk with Hillary was one of the proudest moments of my life, 336, 375
I will never forget the look on Secretary Clintons face when you told her guys had been president for long enough and it was time for women to take control, 375, 405
She called you the smartest 10-year-old in the world and she was right." "Jojo I know you havent met her yet but dont worry—Im working on it." I want both of you girls to grow up in a better safer more prosperous country, 405, 448
I know Secretary Clinton can—and will—build that country, 448, 456
If you study hard love your family serve your community are never afraid to lead and continue to follow the model of your mother your grandmothers and women like Secretary Clinton nothing should ever stop you from achieving your dreams, 456, 496
I am doing everything I can to put a woman in the White House because I believe both of you can grow up to be president—and I want you to believe it too, 496, 529
