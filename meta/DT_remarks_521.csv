It is great to be here in Charlotte to discuss an issue that means so much to me, 0, 18
That is the issue of urban renewal and the rebuilding of our inner cities, 18, 32
Today I want to talk about how to grow the African-American middle class and to provide a new deal for Black America, 32, 54
That deal is grounded in three promises: safe communities great education and high-paying jobs, 54, 68
My vision rests on a principle that has defined this campaign: America First, 68, 81
Every African-American citizen in this country is entitled to a government that puts their jobs wages and security first, 81, 100
"Im asking today for the honor of your vote and the privilege to represent you as your President, 100, 118
Here is the promise I make to you: whether you vote for me or not I will be your greatest champion, 118, 139
I have no special interest I take no orders from donors or lobbyists – I work for you and only you." Our campaign is about change optimism and the future, 139, 169
I am asking people to break from the bitter failures of the past and to imagine the amazing possibilities for our future, 169, 191
Our opponent represents the rigged system and failed thinking of yesterday, 191, 202
Her campaign offers only the depressing pessimism that says this is as good as it gets that nothing can ever really change, 202, 224
"Hillary has been there for 30 years and hasnt fixed anything – shes just made it worse." American politics is caught in a time loop – we keep electing the same people who keep making the same mistakes and who keep offering the same excuses, 224, 269
The fact that our corrupt Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our movement is just more proof that we represent the kind of change that arrives only once in a lifetime, 269, 302
"Every day Im out on the trail proposing fresh solutions and new thinking, 302, 315
And every day the same people getting rich off our broken system tell us that we cant change and that we cant try anything new." "I have a message for all the doubters in Washington: Americas future belongs to the dreamers not the cynics." "And its time to extend that dream to every African-American citizen in this country." African-American citizens have sacrificed so much for this nation, 315, 382
They have fought and died in every war since the Revolution and from the pews and the picket lines they have lifted up the conscience of our country in the long march for Civil Rights, 382, 417
Yet too many African-Americans have been left behind, 417, 425
45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty, 425, 437
58% of African-American youth are not currently employed, 437, 445
African-Americans compromise roughly 13 percent of the population yet make-up 60% of murder victims under the age of 22, 445, 464
"In 2015 violent crime in Charlotte increased by 18 percent – and its expected to rise 24% in 2016." In the city of Chicago nearly 3500 people have been shot since January of this year, 464, 499
The conditions in our inner cities today are unacceptable, 499, 508
"The Democrats have run our inner cities for fifty sixty seventy years or more, 508, 522
Theyve run the school boards the city councils the mayors offices and the congressional seats, 522, 537
Their policies have failed and theyve failed miserably." "Theyve trapped children in failing government schools and opposed school choice at every turn." "The Clintons gave us NAFTA and Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization two deals that de-industrialized America uprooted our industry and stripped bare towns like Detroit and Baltimore and the inner cities of North Carolina, 537, 595
This state has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillarys NAFTA decimating the African-American middle class." Democratic policies have also given rise to crippling crime and violence, 595, 626
Then there is the issue of taxation and regulation, 626, 635
Massive taxes massive regulation of small business and radical restrictions on American energy have driven jobs and opportunities out of our inner cities, 635, 658
Hillary wants to raise taxes on successful small businesses as high as 45 percent – which will only drive more jobs out of your community and into other countries, 658, 687
One of the greatest betrayals has been the issue of immigration, 687, 698
Illegal immigration violates the civil rights of African-Americans, 698, 706
No group has been more economically-harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African-American workers, 706, 721
Hillarys pledge to enact "open borders" – made in secret to a foreign bank – would destroy the African-American middle class, 721, 742
"At the center of my revitalization plan is the issue of trade, 742, 754
Massive chronic trade deficits have emptied out our jobs, 754, 763
Just look at what has happened to Baltimore Detroit Pittsburgh Cleveland and right here in North Carolina, 763, 780
Its the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world." "If Im President and the executives at Ford Motor Company announce they are moving their plants and jobs to Mexico I will pick up the phone and make a simple call, 780, 822
I will tell those executives that if they move their factories to Mexico I will put a 35% tax on their product before they ship it back into the United States, 822, 853
We wont let your jobs be stolen from you anymore, 853, 863
When we stop the offshoring to low-wage countries we raise wages at home – meaning rent and bills become instantly more affordable." At the same time my plan to lower the business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent will bring thousands of new companies onto our shores, 863, 911
It also includes a massive middle class tax cut tax-free childcare savings accounts and childcare tax deductions and credits, 911, 930
I will also propose tax holidays for inner-city investment and new tax incentives to get foreign companies to relocate in blighted American neighborhoods, 930, 953
I will further empower cities and states to seek a federal disaster designation for blighted communities in order to initiate the rebuilding of vital infrastructure the demolition of abandoned properties and the increased presence of law enforcement, 953, 990
"I will also pursue financial reforms to make it easier for young African-Americans to get credit to pursue their dreams in business and create jobs in their communities, 990, 1018
Dodd-Frank has been a disaster making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need, 1018, 1035
The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession – through lifting Glass-Steagall pushing subprime lending and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie, 1035, 1059
Its time for a 21st century Glass Steagall and as part of that a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need." We will also encourage small-business creation by allowing social welfare workers to convert poverty assistance into repayable but forgive-able micro-loans, 1059, 1103
Then there is the issue of public safety, 1103, 1111
Making our communities safe again will be a priority for the Trump Administration, 1111, 1124
I have heard and have listened to the concerns raised by African-American citizens about our justice system and I promise that under a Trump Administration the law will be applied fairly equally and without prejudice, 1124, 1159
There will be only one set of rules – not a two-tiered system of justice, 1159, 1174
The best evidence of unequal justice is that Hillary Clinton could violate so many laws bleach and delete 33000 emails after a Congressional subpoena lie to Congress and the FBI – put our national security at grave risk – and not even face so much as a fine, 1174, 1222
Equal justice also means the same rules for Wall Street, 1222, 1232
The Obama Administration never held Wall Street accountable, 1232, 1240
We will also police our streets, 1240, 1246
I want every poor African-American child to be able to walk down the street in peace, 1246, 1262
Safety is a civil right, 1262, 1267
The problem is not the presence of police but the absence of police, 1267, 1280
I will invest in training and funding both local and federal law enforcement operations to remove the gang members drug dealers and criminal cartels from our neighborhoods, 1280, 1307
The reduction of crime is not merely a goal – but a necessity, 1307, 1320
We will get it done, 1320, 1325
The war on police urged on by my rival is reckless and dangerous and puts African-American lives at risk, 1325, 1344
We must work with our police not against them, 1344, 1353
On immigration my policy is simple, 1353, 1359
I will restore the civil rights of African-Americans Hispanic-Americans and all Americans by ending illegal immigration, 1359, 1375
I will reform visa rules to give American workers preference for jobs and I will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, 1375, 1405
A portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws and suspending refugees will be re-invested in our inner cities, 1405, 1425
It is time to help the American citizens who have become refugees in their own country, 1425, 1441
Infrastructure will be another major goal, 1441, 1447
My contract calls for $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment of which the inner cities will be a major beneficiary, 1447, 1467
"I will also cancel all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton including all global warming payments to the United Nations, 1467, 1487
These steps will save $100 billion over 8 years and this money will be used to help rebuild the vital infrastructure including water systems in Americas inner cities." "School choice is at the center of my plan, 1487, 1524
My proposal redirects education spending to allow every disadvantaged child in America to attend the public private charter magnet religious or home school of their choice, 1524, 1550
School choice is the great civil rights issue of our time and I will be the nations biggest cheerleader for school choice in all 50 states, 1550, 1576
I will also appoint a commission to investigate the school to prison pipeline and to shut it down and create a new pathway that leads from a great education to a great job, 1576, 1609
My plan will also ensure funding for Historical Black Colleges and Universities more affordable 2 and 4-year college and support for trade and vocational education." Finally today my agenda includes the protection of religious liberty the promotion of family and support for the African-American church, 1609, 1654
This is just the beginning, 1654, 1659
Because I will never ever take the African-American community for granted, 1659, 1670
It will be my mission to prove to this country that yesterday does not have to be tomorrow, 1670, 1688
The cycle of poverty can be broken and great new things can happen for our people, 1688, 1704
"But to achieve this future we must reject the failed elites in Washington whove been wrong about virtually everything for decades." The people opposing us promised that passing NAFTA and opening our markets to China would bring a new era of prosperity and job creation, 1704, 1749
Instead they brought only poverty and heartache, 1749, 1756
"The people opposing us are the same people whove wasted $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that have produced only more terrorism more death and more suffering – imagine if that money had been spent at home." My opponent unleashed ISIS on the world, 1756, 1802
She tried to build Democracy in Libya and failed, 1802, 1811
She tried to build Democracy in Iraq and failed, 1811, 1820
She tried regime change in Egypt and failed, 1820, 1828
She pressed regime change in Syria and failed, 1828, 1836
She tried a Russian Reset that failed, 1836, 1843
She tried an Asia Pivot that failed, 1843, 1850
Now Hillary Clinton wants to confront nuclear-armed Russia with a shooting war in Syria that could lead us into World War III, 1850, 1872
"Finally our opponents passed a healthcare law embraced by Hillary Clinton over the furious objections of the American voter, 1872, 1891
Obamacare is now destroying our healthcare system – premiums are skyrocketing double-digits and are surging by more than 100% in the great state of Arizona, 1891, 1916
Doctors are quitting insurers are leaving and companies are fleeing, 1916, 1926
Every prediction they made about this law was a lie, 1926, 1936
If we dont repeal and replace this disastrous law we will lose our healthcare system forever." Now is the time to embrace a New Direction, 1936, 1961
"Ive been very lucky and have led a great life, 1961, 1971
Now I want to give back to the country which has been so good to me, 1971, 1987
I just left a hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C, 1987, 1998
delivered under budget and ahead of schedule creating thousands of jobs including construction, 1998, 2011
It will be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world and a great symbol for our country, 2011, 2030
I took two hours to fly into Washington to cut the ribbon with my children and then jump on the plane to be here with you, 2030, 2056
I wanted to be there for my children who worked so hard on this hotel -- parents must stick with encourage and support their children, 2056, 2081
They did a great job on the hotel and I told them so, 2081, 2094
Likewise the workers did a magnificent job -- without them it could never have been built so quickly and so beautifully, 2094, 2115
The rebuilding we did of the Old Post Office is the rebuilding I want to do for our country." "I want to go into the inner cities the poor rural communities and the failing schools and I want to work on a national plan for revitalization, 2115, 2161
Im tired of the excuses from our politicians, 2161, 2169
Im tired of being told what cant be done, 2169, 2178
Im tired of people asking Americans to defer their dreams to another day but really another decade." "Enough waiting, 2178, 2197
The time is now, 2197, 2201
There is nothing we cant accomplish, 2201, 2207
There is no task or project too great, 2207, 2215
There is no dream outside our reach." Everywhere I go in this country all I see is untapped potential waiting to be set free, 2215, 2239
But we will never realize that potential if we continue putting our faith in a broken political system that has let us down time and again, 2239, 2265
We have to choose the more optimistic path – we have to choose to believe not in our politicians but to believe in ourselves and in our country, 2265, 2293
If we do that anything is possible, 2293, 2300
"Im asking America to join me in dreaming big and bold things for our future, 2300, 2315
Lets close the history books on the failures in Washington and lets open a new chapter of success and prosperity for everyone." I am humbled beyond words to be the nominee for the Party of Abraham Lincoln, 2315, 2352
And it is my highest and greatest hope that the Republican Party can be the home of the African-American vote once again, 2352, 2374
Together we will have a government of by and for the people, 2374, 2386
And we will Make America Great Again For All Americans, 2386, 2396
