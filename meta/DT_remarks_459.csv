"Thank you, 0, 2
Its wonderful to be back in North Carolina." Come November 8 we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House, 2, 29
We are going to bring back your jobs, 29, 37
We are going to cut your taxes, 37, 44
We are going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, 44, 53
And we are going to protect our country from Radical Islamic Terrorism, 53, 65
Over the weekend there were Islamic terrorist attacks in Minnesota and New York City and in New Jersey, 65, 83
These attacks were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country, 83, 110
Attack after attack – from 9/11 to San Bernardino to Orlando – we have seen how failures to screen who is entering the United States puts all of our citizens in danger, 110, 142
So let me state this very clearly: immigration security is national security, 142, 154
"My opponent has the most open borders policy of anyone ever to seek the presidency, 154, 169
As Secretary of State she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released into our communities because their home countries wouldnt take them back." "Now Obama wants to bring in an additional 110000 refugees and Hillary wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees, 169, 212
Altogether Hillary Clintons plan would bring in 620000 refugees in her first term – with no effective way to screen or vet them, 212, 235
Her plan would cost $400 billion dollars in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs." "This isnt just a matter of terrorism but also quality of life, 235, 262
We want to make sure we are only admitting people into our country who love our country." My highest duty as President is to protect our citizens and to uphold the Constitution of the United States, 262, 298
I will honor that duty to the fullest extent every single day – and I will never waver in that sacred obligation, 298, 320
"Its just a plain fact that our current immigration system makes no real attempt to determine the views of the people entering, 320, 342
Since 9/11 hundreds of immigrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism and terrorist-related activity in the United States." Now we learn that another 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted citizenship despite pending deportation orders, 342, 385
This is unacceptable, 385, 388
Altogether there are nearly 1 million individuals in the United States with deportation orders who have not yet been removed, 388, 408
In the 20th Century the United States defeated Fascism Nazism and Communism, 408, 420
Now we must defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism, 420, 427
"Yet my opponent wont even say the words Radical Islamic Terrorism, 427, 438
In fact Hillary Clinton talks tougher about my supporters than she does about Islamic terrorists, 438, 453
She calls the patriotic Americans who support our campaign – many of them cops and soldiers – deplorable and irredeemable, 453, 473
Has she ever talked that way about Radical Islam or about those who oppress and murder women and gays overseas? Has Hillary Clinton ever called people who support these practices deplorable and irredeemable? In many countries overseas non-believers face the death penalty – where is Hillarys condemnation here?" "Lets ask Hillary Clinton: how many people who subscribe to Radical Islamic views and support the oppression of non-believers would you call deplorable or irredeemable – or are those words reserved only for hardworking Americans that truly love their country and that support Donald Trump?" America can never elect a President like Hillary Clinton who apparently with her choice of words thinks decent American citizens are a bigger threat than Radical Islamic Terrorists, 473, 594
Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country, 594, 607
Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred oppression and violence of Radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our President, 607, 628
The commander-in-chief of this nation must speak with moral clarity and conviction, 628, 640
Our system of government is the best in the world and as your President I will defend our values – and speak out against all those who assault our values in any way, 640, 673
"Its also time to remember one very important word: accountability, 673, 683
All this disaster with ISIS happened on Hillary Clintons watch." Her policies in Iraq Libya and Syria are responsible for the rise of ISIS, 683, 707
Her attacks on me are all meant to deflect from her record of unleashing this monstrous evil upon us, 707, 726
Her timetable withdrawal from Iraq her push for regime change in Libya and Syria her open borders policies – these are the actions that unleashed the ISIS disaster, 726, 754
So she will say and do anything to distract from that record of total failure, 754, 769
Her claim that my opposition to Radical Islamic Terrorism is a recruiting tool demonstrates a level of ignorance about the terror threat that is disqualifying, 769, 794
When she says my opposition to radical Islamic Terror provides "aid and comfort" to the enemy we know that Hillary Clinton has once again demonstrated that she is dangerously unfit for office, 794, 826
Her comments are not only reckless but beneath the dignity of the office she seeks, 826, 841
"ISIS is torturing murdering executing and exterminating people in a campaign of genocide, 841, 854
And what is Hillary Clintons suggestion? That we should censor our vocabulary so as not to upset these butchers, 854, 873
I have news for Hillary Clinton: refusing to call out Radical Islam will not lessen the danger it will only increase and embolden the danger – just like we have seen during her disastrous and failed tenure as Secretary of State." "The rise of ISIS is Hillary Clintons foreign policy legacy." Secretary Clinton has helped to topple regimes displace millions and then opened the door to ISIS to enter our country, 873, 944
How is this a smart policy? "Hillary Clintons decisions overseas have left us with the threat we face today – and her immigration policies will invite this threat onto our shores." We must stop the massive inflow of refugees – which Hillary Clinton is trying to drastically increase, 944, 992
We should temporarily suspend immigration entirely from regions where safe and adequate screening cannot occur, 992, 1007
Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large numbers of immigrants extreme views about religion – such as the death penalty for those who leave the faith– are commonplace, 1007, 1042
"It is the job of a responsible government to admit only those who we expect to succeed and flourish here and to become part of our incredible home, 1042, 1070
Hillary Clinton disagrees with this common sense rule and its one more reason why she can never be President." "Its time to break with the corruption the bad judgement and the failures of the past." It is time to have a new American Future, 1070, 1114
We are going to change our immigration system to reflect American values, 1114, 1126
We are going to stop the policy of regime change overseas and instead focus on working with our allies on a military campaign to utterly destroy ISIS and defeat Islamic terrorism, 1126, 1157
This will not only require military warfare but also financial warfare cyber warfare and ideological warfare, 1157, 1173
But to win this struggle we need to be strong at home, 1173, 1185
We are going to rebuild our country, 1185, 1192
And at the center of that effort will be the rebuilding of our inner cities, 1192, 1207
Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty including 45% of African-American children under the age of six, 1207, 1226
58% of African-American youth are not working, 1226, 1233
"Violent crime rose in Americas fifty largest cities last year, 1233, 1243
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 1243, 1251
and more than 60% in Baltimore." More than 3000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year, 1251, 1271
The schools are failing the jobs are leaving and millions are trapped in poverty, 1271, 1285
To the African-American community I say: vote for Donald J, 1285, 1295
Trump, 1295, 1296
I will fix it – I will bring back your jobs I will fix your schools and I will fight for you as no one ever has before, 1296, 1324
It is time for a new civil rights agenda one that promises safe communities great education and good-paying jobs, 1324, 1343
My whole life has been about creating jobs, 1343, 1351
Hillary Clinton has spent her career destroying jobs – just look at upstate New York and her terrible trade deals, 1351, 1371
"Hillary Clinton supported NAFTA she supported Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization and she supported the job-killing deal with South Korea that she helped to push through." The South Korean deal was supposed to create 70000 jobs – instead we lost 100000 jobs and our trade deficit with South Korea has more than doubled, 1371, 1426
Next Hillary Clinton wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 1426, 1433
"Your state has lost more than 4 in 10 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, 1433, 1446
I am going to renegotiate this disastrous deal – and if we dont get the deal we want I will walk away." Our trade deficit is now nearly $800 billion a year – this is the economic legacy of Hillary Clinton, 1446, 1487
But we are going to turn it all around, 1487, 1496
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: Jobs Jobs Jobs, 1496, 1511
"I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life; Im going to repeal and replace Obamacare; Im going to create American energy independence; Im going to make our government lean responsible and efficient; Im going to fix our terrible trade deals and defend American workers; Im going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and Im going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution of the United States;" We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1511, 1616
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1616, 1636
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1636, 1645
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation, 1645, 1663
American workers will be hired to do the job, 1663, 1672
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 1672, 1684
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People, 1684, 1708
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1708, 1729
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 1729, 1751
Jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing onto our shores, 1751, 1766
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 1766, 1779
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1779, 1785
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1785, 1791
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1791, 1797
And We Will Make America Great Again, 1797, 1804
Thank you and God Bless! , 1804, 1809
