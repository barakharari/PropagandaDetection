 n And I love you too, 21, 27
 n We have a lot of very enthused and excited people in this campaign, 27, 41
So I really do thank all of you, 41, 49
 n "I would like to thank my incredible running mate Mike Pence on the tremendous job hes done, 49, 67
And hes a fantastic leader and a leader on health care..." n "Id also like to thank Dr, 67, 85
Ben Carson, 85, 87
" n "Not only a great man and I dont say that about a lot of people but one of the toughest competitors Ive ever faced, 87, 113
People dont know how well he did during those primaries, 113, 123
And I just kept looking back, 123, 129
And I just kept seeing him, 129, 135
And boy Ill tell you.n" "But even more importantly hes a brilliant physician and I hope he will be very much involved with my administration in the coming years, 135, 164
" n Thank you.n "Id also like to recognize the distinguished members of Congress in attendance who have all been at the forefront of health care and have been so helpful to me: Congresswoman Ellmers Lummis; Congressmen Price Harris Burgess and DesJarlais, 164, 206
" n And let me give a special thanks to Senator Barrasso a terrific doctor a Senate leader who did incredible work chairing our platform committee just unbelievable work, 206, 235
So I want to thank you very much Senator, 235, 244
Fantastic job, 244, 246
 n "And been very very loyal to what were doing and what we represent, 246, 260
So thank you Senator, 260, 264
When we win on November 8th..." ...and elect a Republican Congress we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare, 264, 285
Have to do it, 285, 289
 n I will ask Congress to convene a special session so we can repeal and replace and it will be such an honor for me for you and for everybody in this country because Obamacare has to be replaced, 289, 328
And we will do it and we will do it very very quickly, 328, 341
It is a catastrophe, 341, 345
The president said if you like your plan you can keep your plan, 345, 358
If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.n Which may go down as one of the great political lies of the century, 358, 382
Even the skeptical Democrats believed him and approved the legislation, 382, 392
There were Democrats that were very much against it but they believed him and they approved it, 392, 409
No one ever read or certainly very few people the 2700 page bill, 409, 422
To this day nobody understands it.n "The Obama administration has just announced massive double digit and triple digit Obamacare premium hikes everywhere all throughout the country, 422, 448
Here in Pennsylvania premiums are going to increase more than 60 percent and thats nothing compared to what will happen in the future, 448, 471
Of course in the future Im president there wont be Obamacare so you wont have to worry about it, 471, 490
" n "That means parents wont have enough money to pay their bills or get medicine for their kids, 490, 509
In the great state of Arizona a wonderful place I just left premiums will go up even higher than 116 percent, 509, 530
Other states are going up more than 60 70 80 90 percent, 530, 542
Deductibles can go to $12000 $13000 $14000 even $15000, 542, 551
In other words your health care wont even be usable, 551, 561
Youre paying all this money you wont even get to use it.n" People all across the country are devastated, 561, 580
In many instances their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which by the way is a first in American history, 580, 606
This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life.n "One-third of the counties -- think of this one-third of the counties in Pennsylvania will have only a single insurance company left if you have that, 606, 663
That includes Philadelphia where I went to school, 663, 671
The Associated Press found that some of the 440000 Pennsylvania consumers who buy insurance through healthcare.gov will face some of the highest premium increases in the nation, 671, 698
The people of Philadelphia, 698, 702
Insurers are leaving premiums are soaring doctors are quitting companies are fleeing and deductibles go through the roof, 702, 720
Workers hours are being cut hiring is frozen -- totally frozen -- and wages are being slashed, 720, 737
Obamacare means higher prices fewer choices and lower quality, 737, 746
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to expand Obamacare and make it even more expensive, 746, 759
She wants to put the government totally in charge of health care in America, 759, 773
If we dont repeal and replace Obamacare we will destroy American health care forever.n" "Its one of the single most important reasons why we must win on November 8th we must win, 773, 805
" n Thank you, 805, 809
 n Thank you.n Thank you very much everybody, 809, 817
Thank you.n Our replacement plan includes health savings accounts a nationwide insurance market where you can purchase across state lines and letting states manage Medicaid dollars so much better, 817, 846
We will create quality reliable affordable health care in a free market where parents can make the health care decisions that they really wanna make for their families, 846, 874
It will be a much better health care at a much less expensive cost.n "Weve also outlined detailed solutions on so many other issues to make life better for every American family, 874, 906
And while this is really -- thank you, 906, 914
" n "While this is really a meeting and thats what it is its a meeting of very very special people and I appreciate you all being here, 914, 942
But its a meeting talking about health care and Obamacare, 942, 952
Our plan for other things also include the bringing back of manufacturing jobs, 952, 965
We have to do it, 965, 970
" " Were gonna bring back your manufacturing were gonna bring back our jobs that formed the backbone of the American middle class and our country as a wholen" Our jobs are being stolen, 970, 1004
Pennsylvania has lost almost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton, 1004, 1027
The city of Philadelphia has lost more than one-third of its manufacturing jobs since China joined the Word Trade Organization another Bill and Hillary-backed disaster.n A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA believe me, 1027, 1060
And we have the greatest negotiators in the world, 1060, 1069
We will use our great negotiators, 1069, 1075
 n "Well have a fair deal but well have a deal that goes in two directions not one direction right into Mexico and these other places, 1075, 1101
" n And stand up to foreign product dumping currency manipulation and unfair subsidy behavior, 1101, 1116
 n "We are going to bring manufacturing jobs lots of jobs back to Pennsylvania, 1116, 1130
Were gonna do it, 1130, 1134
And it wont even be difficult, 1134, 1140
" n "Were going to open modern mines and take care of our great miners, 1140, 1155
Our miners have been mistreated horribly, 1155, 1161
" n We will be producing clean coal oil natural gas and shale energy, 1161, 1175
 n "Were also bringing back our steel workers who have been so badly hurt so badly hurt, 1175, 1192
" n Whose jobs have been stolen by the dumping of steel all over the state and frankly all over this country by China and other countries, 1192, 1219
Nobody has been treated worse than these workers but that will change on January 20th of next year believe me, 1219, 1239
It will change, 1239, 1242
 n "Were also going to provide the children of the state with school choice, 1242, 1256
So important, 1256, 1258
" n "That means parents can spend and take care of their children but they can send their kids to public school to private to chartered to magnet to religious or to home school, 1258, 1292
Its going to be their right and its going to be something thats so so good for your children and for the education of your children, 1292, 1318
" n "We will also totally eliminate Common Core and bring education local, 1318, 1331
Were gonna bring it local, 1331, 1336
" n People do not like Common Core in this country that I can tell you, 1336, 1352
 n "And our system is failing so its obviously not working, 1352, 1363
Were gonna eliminate Common Core were gonna bring it local.n" Our tax plan will provide a 35 percent tax cut to middle class families with two kids, 1363, 1390
As an example you have two kids a 35 percent cut so desperately needed, 1390, 1404
Our middle class has not been properly respected that I can tell you, 1404, 1417
 n We will let parents deduct childcare expenses from their taxes and create tax-free childcare and elder care savings accounts with matching contributions for low income families, 1417, 1444
 n "We will eliminate the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military, 1444, 1458
When did we ever need it more? Greatest people on Earth in our military but its badly depleted, 1458, 1476
" n "Thank you, 1476, 1480
People love this country dont they? Isnt it beautiful right? Beautiful, 1480, 1491
" n "Its a beautiful thing to watch and see, 1491, 1501
And I see it all over the country no matter where we go, 1501, 1514
And every time I say we are going to rebuild our depleted military its always the same response, 1514, 1532
Its an incredible response, 1532, 1536
" n "Our Navy is the smallest its been since World War I think of that, 1536, 1552
Smallest since World War I, 1552, 1557
And rebuilding it will require a national effort, 1557, 1565
Thats why I will ask my Secretary of the Navy to review facilities like the Philadelphia Navy Yard I know it well, 1565, 1587
" n With a long history of service to our Navy proximity to vibrant private industry and room for expansion to enlist them in the rebuilding of what will be a great fleet again, 1587, 1621
 n To recruit master craftsmen this buildup requires and we will establish centers of excellence at locations like the Philadelphia Navy Yard.n "Vocational training is a great thing, 1621, 1649
We dont do it anymore, 1649, 1654
We dont do it anymore, 1654, 1659
" n "And I must tell you so often in going to college right down the road and going to college we have people that were brilliant and we had other people that werent as brilliant in that way but were brilliant incredible when it came to fixing a motor when it came to fixing something that I had no idea what was happening and other great geniuses had no idea what was happening and they could take it apart blindfolded, 1659, 1740
And we dont do that anymore, 1740, 1746
Vocational training for our country is so so so important, 1746, 1756
" n "And just in closing -- and they loved it, 1756, 1767
They loved it, 1767, 1770
They didnt want to be doing what I was doing, 1770, 1780
They loved it, 1780, 1783
They were so good at it and they loved it, 1783, 1793
So vocational training were going to start it up big league, 1793, 1804
" n "We will rebuild our military and we will rebuild our country, 1804, 1817
Im not a politician, 1817, 1821
My only special interest is you the American people, 1821, 1830
Thats why Ive done this, 1830, 1835
" n Thank you very much, 1835, 1841
 n The guiding rule of the political class in Washington D.C, 1841, 1852
is that they are looking out only for themselves only for themselves with the exception of these few people, 1852, 1871
 n "I feel guilty as Im looking theyre staring me in the eyes, 1871, 1884
So I have to say with these exceptions, 1884, 1892
They will say anything and do anything and cling to their power and prestige at your expense, 1892, 1909
Im running to change and reverse decades of failure and to work with the American people to create generations of success, 1909, 1930
Im running.., 1930, 1932
" n "Im running to restore honesty to our government and safety to our communities, 1932, 1947
We need safety, 1947, 1950
And by the way our law enforcement officials these are great great people, 1950, 1963
" n Thank you, 1963, 1967
And we are going to give great prosperity to our economy, 1967, 1978
I want to go into our poorest communities and work on a national plan of revitalization the inner cities, 1978, 1997
 n "And Ive been working with so many African-American groups, 1997, 2007
These are such incredible people, 2007, 2012
Weve been talking about it working on it, 2012, 2020
Were going to bring jobs into the inner cities, 2020, 2029
Were going to bring safety, 2029, 2034
Were going to bring education good good schools into the inner cities, 2034, 2046
" n "The spirit of the people in the inner cities is beyond the spirit of anybody, 2046, 2063
And its gonna work, 2063, 2067
Its gonna work, 2067, 2070
You watch, 2070, 2072
Americans are tired of being told to defer their dreams to another day, 2072, 2085
But politicians for the most part really mean another decade because thats what theyre talking about, 2085, 2101
Enough waiting, 2101, 2103
Time is now.n" But to accomplish our goals we must cut our ties with the small bitter petty politics of the past, 2103, 2125
We must declare our independence from a failed establishment that has squandered $6 trillion on foreign wars in the Middle East that never end that we never win and that have made us far less safe, 2125, 2161
Think of it, 2161, 2164
 n "Think of all the money thats spent all the lives that have been lost.n" "And were far less safe today than we were before we started, 2164, 2191
Theyve left our borders wide open at home and shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries.n" "Its time for new leadership, 2191, 2213
" n "Ive led a great life and I truly love our country, 2213, 2226
So now I want to give back to the country thats been so good to me thats why Im doing this, 2226, 2247
" n "All I see everywhere I travel in this nation and Ive been everywhere is untapped potential waiting to be realized, 2247, 2269
The people are amazing the people are amazing, 2269, 2277
If we unlock the potential of this country and its incredible people no dream is outside of our reach, 2277, 2296
" n If we stopped believing in our failed politicians and start believing in ourselves then anything anything is possible, 2296, 2316
 n "Im asking you to dream big to push for bold change and to believe in a movement powered by our love for each other and our love for our country, 2316, 2347
" n That is how we will truly make America great again, 2347, 2359
 n Thank you very much thank you everybody, 2359, 2367
God bless you thank you, 2367, 2372
