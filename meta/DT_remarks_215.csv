Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation, 0, 24
It truly is a great honor, 24, 30
I’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country one that replaces randomness with purpose ideology with strategy and chaos with peace, 30, 60
It’s time to shake the rust off America’s foreign policy, 60, 70
It’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold something we have to do, 70, 87
The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle, 87, 101
My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else, 101, 119
Has to be first has to be, 119, 126
That will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make, 126, 139
America – thank you, 139, 143
 Applause  America first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration, 143, 156
But to chart our path forward we must first briefly take a look back, 156, 170
We have a lot to be proud of, 170, 178
In the 1940s we saved the world, 178, 185
The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists, 185, 195
Then we saved the world again, 195, 201
This time from totalitarianism and communism, 201, 207
The Cold War it lasted for decades but guess what we won and we won big, 207, 223
Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr, 223, 230
Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan our great president when he said “Tear down this wall.”  Applause History will not forget what he did, 230, 256
Very special special man and president, 256, 262
Unfortunately after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course, 262, 274
We failed to develop a new vision for a new time, 274, 285
In fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense, 285, 301
Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another, 301, 317
They just kept coming and coming, 317, 323
We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya to President Obama’s line in the sand in Syria, 323, 342
Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper, 342, 365
Very bad, 365, 367
It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy, 367, 394
We tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed, 394, 409
Civil war religious fanaticism thousands of Americans and just killed lives lives lives wasted, 409, 423
Horribly wasted, 423, 425
Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result, 425, 434
The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill, 434, 442
Iran too would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment, 442, 457
They have benefited so much so sadly for us, 457, 466
Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster, 466, 475
No vision, 475, 477
No purpose, 477, 479
No direction, 479, 481
No strategy, 481, 483
Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy, 483, 495
First our resources are totally over extended, 495, 502
President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy, 502, 512
He’s crippled us with wasteful spending massive debt low growth a huge trade deficit and open borders, 512, 529
Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year, 529, 543
We’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own, 543, 551
Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength, 551, 578
I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem, 578, 596
I’m the only one — believe me I know them all I’m the only one that knows how to fix it, 596, 617
 Applause Secondly our allies are not paying their fair share and I’ve been talking about this recently a lot, 617, 636
Our allies must contribute toward their financial political and human costs have to do it of our tremendous security burden, 636, 656
But many of them are simply not doing so, 656, 665
They look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us, 665, 685
In NATO for instance only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense, 685, 709
We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes missiles ships equipment building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia, 709, 735
The countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense and if not the U.S, 735, 753
must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves, 753, 762
We have no choice, 762, 766
 Applause The whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security, 766, 786
A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded and funded beautifully, 786, 803
Thirdly our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us, 803, 815
We’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country, 815, 840
He negotiated disastrous deal with Iran and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry, 840, 860
Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon cannot be allowed, 860, 872
Remember that cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, 872, 882
 Applause And under a Trump administration will never ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon, 882, 898
 Applause All of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly I remember that day, 898, 926
In negotiation you must be willing to walk, 926, 934
The Iran deal like so many of our worst agreements is the result of not being willing to leave the table, 934, 955
When the other side knows you’re not going to walk it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win, 955, 976
At the same time your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them, 976, 997
You’ve made that agreement you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place, 997, 1015
President Obama gutted our missile defense program then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic, 1015, 1034
He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place, 1034, 1064
Israel our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity, 1064, 1089
Just a few days ago Vice President Biden again criticized Israel a force for justice and peace for acting as an impatient peace area in the region, 1089, 1116
President Obama has not been a friend to Israel, 1116, 1125
He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power, 1125, 1140
Iran has indeed become a great great power in just a very short period of time because of what we’ve done, 1140, 1161
All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel our allies in the region and very importantly the United States itself, 1161, 1184
 Applause We’ve picked fights with our oldest friends and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help, 1184, 1201
Remember that, 1201, 1203
Not good, 1203, 1205
Fourth our rivals no longer respect us, 1205, 1212
In fact they’re just as confused as our allies but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore, 1212, 1234
The truth is they don’t respect us, 1234, 1241
When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One no leader was there nobody to greet him, 1241, 1259
Perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One, 1259, 1274
Then amazingly the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia, 1274, 1283
It’s called no respect, 1283, 1287
Absolutely no respect, 1287, 1290
Do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen Denmark to get the Olympics for our country and after this unprecedented effort it was announced that the United States came in fourth — fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place, 1290, 1346
He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment, 1346, 1358
We were laughed at all over the world as we have been many many times, 1358, 1373
The list of humiliations go on and on and on, 1373, 1383
President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach, 1383, 1402
Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea, 1402, 1433
We have the leverage, 1433, 1437
We have the power over China economic power and people don’t understand it, 1437, 1450
And with that economic power we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea which is totally out of control, 1450, 1480
He has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies, 1480, 1504
We’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything and they do, 1504, 1520
They do at will, 1520, 1524
It always happens, 1524, 1527
If President Obama’s goal had been to weaken America he could not have done a better job, 1527, 1544
Finally America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals, 1544, 1557
Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy, 1557, 1577
One day we’re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians, 1577, 1593
The next day we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart, 1593, 1610
Lives lost massive moneys lost, 1610, 1615
The world is a different place, 1615, 1621
We’re a humanitarian nation but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness confusion and disarray a mess, 1621, 1640
We’ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before, 1640, 1652
We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide, 1652, 1662
 Applause We have done nothing to help the Christians nothing and we should always be ashamed for that for that lack of action, 1662, 1685
Our actions in Iraq Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS and we’re in a war against radical Islam but President Obama won’t even name the enemy and unless you name the enemy you will never ever solve the problem, 1685, 1725
 Applause Hillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country, 1725, 1750
After Secretary Clinton’s failed intervention in Libya Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans, 1750, 1773
Then instead of taking charge that night Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep, 1773, 1788
Incredible, 1788, 1789
Clinton blames it all on a video an excuse that was a total lie proven to be absolutely a total lie, 1789, 1810
Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation, 1810, 1822
And by the way she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning, 1822, 1840
And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil, 1840, 1855
And you know what? We don’t blockade we don’t bomb we don’t do anything about it, 1855, 1871
It’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening which could be a fact and could be true, 1871, 1891
This will all change when I become president, 1891, 1899
To our friends and allies I say America is going to be strong again, 1899, 1913
America is going to be reliable again, 1913, 1920
It’s going to be a great and reliable ally again, 1920, 1930
It’s going to be a friend again, 1930, 1937
We’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies, 1937, 1957
 Applause We’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world, 1957, 1974
Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge, 1974, 1987
We need a new rational American foreign policy informed by the best minds and supported by both parties and it will be by both parties — Democrats Republicans independents everybody as well as by our close allies, 1987, 2024
This is how we won the Cold War and it’s how we will win our new future struggles which may be many which may be complex but we will win if I become president, 2024, 2058
 Applause First we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam, 2058, 2074
Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world, 2074, 2095
Events may require the use of military force but it’s also a philosophical struggle like our long struggle in the Cold War, 2095, 2117
In this we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence attacks and everything else, 2117, 2147
It is a dangerous world more dangerous now than it has ever been, 2147, 2160
We should work — thank you, 2160, 2166
 Applause We should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam, 2166, 2186
But this has to be a two-way street, 2186, 2194
They must also be good to us, 2194, 2201
Remember that, 2201, 2203
They have to be good to us no longer one way, 2203, 2214
It’s now two-way, 2214, 2217
And remember us and all we’re doing they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them, 2217, 2233
We’re going to help but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them, 2233, 2247
The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland, 2247, 2258
There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism, 2258, 2270
For every case known to the public there are dozens and dozens more, 2270, 2283
We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies, 2283, 2292
We have no idea where these people are coming from, 2292, 2302
There’s no documentation, 2302, 2305
There’s no paperwork, 2305, 2308
There’s nothing, 2308, 2310
We have to be smart, 2310, 2315
We have to be vigilant, 2315, 2320
A pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly much worse, 2320, 2337
All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th one of the great catastrophes in my opinion the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what’s happened and citizens were attacked as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes, 2337, 2401
And then there’s ISIS, 2401, 2405
I have a simple message for them, 2405, 2412
Their days are numbered, 2412, 2416
I won’t tell them where and I won’t tell them how, 2416, 2427
We must …  Applause … we must as a nation be more unpredictable, 2427, 2440
We are totally predictable, 2440, 2444
We tell everything, 2444, 2447
We’re sending troops, 2447, 2450
We tell them, 2450, 2453
We’re sending something else, 2453, 2457
We have a news conference, 2457, 2462
We have to be unpredictable, 2462, 2467
And we have to be unpredictable starting now, 2467, 2475
But they’re going to be gone, 2475, 2481
ISIS will be gone if I’m elected president, 2481, 2489
And they’ll be gone quickly, 2489, 2494
They will be gone very very quickly, 2494, 2501
 Applause Secondly we have to rebuild our military and our economy, 2501, 2512
The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability but look at what’s happened to us, 2512, 2529
Our nuclear weapons arsenal our ultimate deterrent has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal, 2529, 2550
And it has to happen immediately, 2550, 2556
Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today, 2556, 2573
The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time, 2573, 2590
The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991, 2590, 2599
Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today, 2599, 2606
These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room, 2606, 2616
And what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011, 2616, 2646
Our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming, 2646, 2663
We will spend what we need to rebuild our military, 2663, 2673
It is the cheapest single investment we can make, 2673, 2682
We will develop build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind, 2682, 2694
Our military dominance must be unquestioned and I mean unquestioned by anybody and everybody, 2694, 2708
But we will look for savings and spend our money wisely, 2708, 2719
In this time of mounting debt right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem, 2719, 2741
But I do, 2741, 2744
No one dollar can be wasted, 2744, 2750
Not one single dollar can we waste, 2750, 2757
We’re also going to have to change our trade immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again, 2757, 2776
And to put Americans first again, 2776, 2782
This will ensure that our own workers right here in America get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues increase our economic might as a nation make us strong financially again, 2782, 2817
So so important, 2817, 2820
We need to think smarter about areas where our technological superiority and nobody comes close gives us an edge, 2820, 2839
This includes 3D printing artificial intelligence and cyber warfare, 2839, 2848
 A great country also takes care of its warriors, 2848, 2857
Our commitment to them is absolute and I mean absolute, 2857, 2867
A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve, 2867, 2891
And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life, 2891, 2911
Our veterans …  Applause … our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly, 2911, 2925
These are our great people and we must treat them fairly, 2925, 2936
We must even treat them really really well and that will happen under the Trump administration, 2936, 2952
 Applause Finally we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests, 2952, 2964
Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries, 2964, 2980
Look at what happened in the 1990s, 2980, 2987
Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania — and this was a horrible period of time for us — were attacked and 17 brave sailors were killed on the USS Cole, 2987, 3017
And what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade Organization which has been a total disaster for the United States, 3017, 3046
Frankly we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaida, 3046, 3060
We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn’t do it, 3060, 3076
And then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, 3076, 3089
Again the worst attack on our country in its history, 3089, 3099
Our foreign policy goals must be based on America’s core national security interests, 3099, 3112
And the following will be my priorities, 3112, 3119
In the Middle East our goals must be and I mean must be to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability not radical change, 3119, 3142
We need to be clear sighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies, 3142, 3159
And believe me we have groups that no matter what you do they will be the enemy, 3159, 3176
We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are who those people are and not help them, 3176, 3196
And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends, 3196, 3211
 Applause We desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China, 3211, 3224
We have serious differences with these two nations and must regard them with open eyes but we are not bound to be adversaries, 3224, 3247
We should seek common ground based on shared interests, 3247, 3256
Russia for instance has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism, 3256, 3267
I believe an easing of tensions an improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible absolutely possible, 3267, 3288
Common sense says this cycle this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon, 3288, 3305
Good for both countries, 3305, 3309
Some say the Russians won’t be reasonable, 3309, 3316
I intend to find out, 3316, 3321
If we can’t make a deal under my administration a deal that’s great — not good great — for America but also good for Russia then we will quickly walk from the table, 3321, 3354
It’s as simple as that, 3354, 3359
We’re going to find out, 3359, 3364
Fixing our relations with China is another important step — and really toward creating a even more prosperous period of time, 3364, 3385
China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically which they are doing like never before we have lost all of their respect, 3385, 3411
We have a massive trade deficit with China a deficit that we have to find a way quickly and I mean quickly to balance, 3411, 3435
A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China better than we have right now, 3435, 3457
Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea, 3457, 3468
They’re not supposed to be doing it, 3468, 3475
No respect for this country or this president, 3475, 3483
We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways, 3483, 3495
If need be that’s what’s going to have to happen, 3495, 3505
After I’m elected president I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies, 3505, 3528
In these summits we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges, 3528, 3558
For instance we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO’s outdated mission and structure grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges including migration and Islamic terrorism, 3558, 3588
 Applause I will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative, 3588, 3602
But if America fights it must only fight to win, 3602, 3612
 Applause I will never send our finest into battle unless necessary and I mean absolutely necessary and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V, 3612, 3644
 Applause Our goal is peace and prosperity not war and destruction, 3644, 3655
The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined deliberate and consistent foreign policy, 3655, 3671
With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless rudderless and aimless foreign policy one that has blazed a path of destruction in its wake, 3671, 3701
After losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever ever ever before, 3701, 3726
I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama-Clinton, 3726, 3738
It has been a complete and total disaster, 3738, 3746
I will also be prepared to deploy America’s economic resources, 3746, 3756
Financial leverage and sanctions can be very very persuasive but we need to use them selectively and with total determination, 3756, 3776
Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules, 3776, 3789
In other words if they do not treat us fairly, 3789, 3799
Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand I will enforce that line in the sand, 3799, 3822
Believe me, 3822, 3824
 Applause However unlike other candidates for the presidency war and aggression will not be my first instinct, 3824, 3841
You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy, 3841, 3849
A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength, 3849, 3862
Although not in government service I was totally against the war in Iraq very proudly saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East, 3862, 3888
Sadly I was correct and the biggest beneficiary has been Iran who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very very rich oil reserves something it has wanted to do for decades, 3888, 3923
And now to top it off we have ISIS, 3923, 3932
My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations, 3932, 3946
That’s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect resumes but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war, 3946, 3993
We have to look to new people, 3993, 4000
 Applause We have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing even though they may look awfully good writing in the New York Times or being watched on television, 4000, 4038
Finally I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions, 4038, 4051
Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions, 4051, 4089
 Applause These are my goals as president, 4089, 4096
I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans whatever their party can support so important and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome, 4096, 4123
The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies that’s what we want, 4123, 4157
We want them to be our allies, 4157, 4164
We want the world to be our — we want to bring peace to the world, 4164, 4180
Too much destruction out there too many destructive weapons, 4180, 4189
The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world, 4189, 4205
To achieve these goals Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership, 4205, 4219
Again many Americans must wonder why our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own, 4219, 4242
Americans …  Applause … Americans must know that we’re putting the American people first again on trade, 4242, 4259
 Applause So true, 4259, 4262
On trade on immigration on foreign policy, 4262, 4269
The jobs incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority, 4269, 4284
 Applause No country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first, 4284, 4298
Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we while being fair to them must start doing the same, 4298, 4321
We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism, 4321, 4337
The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony, 4337, 4347
I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter…  Applause And under my administration we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs, 4347, 4387
 Applause NAFTA as an example has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states — literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs, 4387, 4417
And I’ve just gotten to see it, 4417, 4424
I’ve toured Pennsylvania, 4424, 4427
I’ve toured New York, 4427, 4431
I’ve toured so many of the states, 4431, 4438
They have been cleaned out, 4438, 4443
Their manufacturing is gone, 4443, 4447
Never again only the reverse — and I have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen, 4447, 4468
We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones, 4468, 4478
There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later, 4478, 4495
They fire the people, 4495, 4499
They take advantage of the United States, 4499, 4506
There will be consequences for those companies, 4506, 4513
Never again, 4513, 4515
Under a Trump administration no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country, 4515, 4538
 Applause I will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests, 4538, 4553
I will be America’s greatest defender and most loyal champion, 4553, 4563
We will not apologize for becoming successful again but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are, 4563, 4584
The world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest, 4584, 4596
America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker, 4596, 4608
We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself but to play that role we must make America strong again, 4608, 4629
 Applause And always — always always we must make and we have to look at it from every angle and we have no choice we must make America respected again, 4629, 4659
We must make America truly wealthy again, 4659, 4666
And we must — we have to and we will make America great again, 4666, 4680
And if we do that — and if we do that perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever ever known, 4680, 4707
Thank you very much everybody, 4707, 4712
I appreciate it, 4712, 4715
Thank you, 4715, 4717
 Applause Thank you very much, 4717, 4722
 Applause Thank you, 4722, 4725
