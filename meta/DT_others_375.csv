So its been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference, 1, 15
And you as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports should ask yourselves why, 15, 31
And Ill tell you why, 31, 36
Because despite the nice platitudes shes been a mess." "You look at whats happened with ISIS which isnt even mentioned, 36, 56
You look at whats happening with law and order they dont even mention our police, 56, 71
They mention everybody but our police, 71, 77
They dont have an American flag on the dais until we started complaining and then they ran up with two very small little flags one that we saw." "So you know I put myself through your news conferences often not that its fun, 77, 120
235 days no news conference for Hillary Clinton, 120, 128
You oughta check it out because theres a lot going on." Her great disloyalty to the person that rigged the system for her Debbie Wasserman Schultz she totally rigged it, 128, 158
Bernie Sanders never had a chance, 158, 164
"And total disloyalty its like youre fired get out fast, 164, 174
The e-mail situation I call it the double e-mail situation both very serious, 174, 187
What was said in the last ones to the DNC was horrible absolutely horrible." "If I wouldve used language like they used about religion about race about everything else that they discuss in those e-mails I wouldve had to run and hide and probably drop out of the race." "With her everythings just fine, 187, 241
So just ask yourself why she doesnt have news conferences, 241, 251
And honestly the reason is because theres no way she can answer questions because the job she has done is so bad." "When they talk about change I noticed they have change, 251, 283
Shes been there for 30 years, 283, 289
Thirty years, 289, 291
Theres no change, 291, 294
Its going to be the same its going to be an extension of Obama, 294, 308
In my opinion worse." "She lied about TPP, 308, 316
She was for TPP she saw me on television knocking the hell out of it because its a horror show its going to kill all our jobs its going to be almost as bad as NAFTA maybe worse which her husband signed by the way which destroyed this country destroyed manufacturing in the United States." "And Ill do something about it thatll be so renegotiated, 316, 381
And by the way yesterday for the first time she said she wants to renegotiate trade agreements, 381, 398
First time yesterday, 398, 401
Well because of me." "She also saw me talking about TPP and currency manipulation and currency devaluation, 401, 418
And she heard it and she said wow she cant win that subject in a debate." "So all of a sudden she goes and she goes against TPP her vice president is one of the biggest proponents of TPP and now hes going against it, 418, 463
And Bernie Sanders was right he was against it." "They will go for TPP and vote it in very shortly after the election if she wins which for the sake of our country we all hope and I hope that she doesnt, 463, 505
They will vote it in—just mark my words hopefully we dont have to worry about it—but she will vote." "Shell change a comma shell change a paragraph of the 6000 page document that nobodys even read on our side, 505, 544
Just so you understand the other countries know every word every paragraph every sentence every single comma and period." "We dont even read it our country, 544, 570
Because were led by stupid people, 570, 576
so she saw me talking about TPP she realized that she couldnt defend it her special interests are pushing her hard because shes bought and sold by the special interests." "Theyre pushing her very hard and so she said shes against it, 576, 618
The day she gets in—which hopefully will never happen—she will approve or shortly thereafter TPP, 618, 633
And that will be another disaster for job in our country OK?" "So why dont we start off any questions? Yes sir?" , 633, 655
  ", 655, 656
Its just a total deflection this whole thing with Russia, 656, 666
In fact I saw her campaign manager I dont know his title Mook, 666, 679
I saw him on television and they asked him about Russia and the hacking." "By the way they hacked—they probably have her 33000 e-mails, 679, 703
I hope they do, 703, 707
They probably have her 33000 e-mails that she lost and deleted because youd see some beauties there, 707, 724
So lets see." "But I watched this guy Mook and he talked about we think it was Russia that hacked, 724, 744
Now first of all was what was said on those thats so bad but he said I watched it, 744, 763
I think he was live, 763, 768
But he said we think it was Russia that hacked." And then he said—and this is in person sitting and watching television as Ive been doing—and then he said could be Trump yeah yeah, 768, 802
Trump Trump oh yeah Trump, 802, 807
He reminded me of John Lovitz for "Saturday Night Live" in the liar where hed go yes yes I went to Harvard Harvard yes yes, 807, 832
This is the guy you have to see it, 832, 841
Yes it could be Trump yes yes, 841, 848
So it is so farfetched, 848, 853
Its so ridiculous, 853, 856
Honestly I wish I had that power, 856, 863
Id love to have that power but Russia has no respect for our country, 863, 877
"And thats why—if it is Russia nobody even knows this its probably China or it could be somebody sitting in his bed, 877, 899
But it shows how weak we are it shows how disrespected we are, 899, 912
Total—assuming its Russia or China or one of the major countries and competitors its a total sign of disrespect for our country, 912, 934
Putin and the leaders throughout the world have no respect for our country anymore and they certainly have no respect for our leader, 934, 957
So I know nothing about it, 957, 963
Its one of the most farfetched Ive ever heard, 963, 972
Yes Jon?" , 972, 974
  ", 974, 975
I never met Putin I dont know who Putin is, 975, 985
He said one nice thing about me, 985, 992
He said Im a genius, 992, 997
I said thank you very much to the newspaper and that was the end of it, 997, 1013
I never met Putin." , 1013, 1017
  ", 1017, 1018
I would treat Vladimir Putin firmly but theres nothing that I can think of that Id rather do than have Russia friendly as opposed to the way they are right now so that we can go and knock out ISIS together with other people and with other countries, 1018, 1066
Wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along with people wouldnt it be nice if we actually got along as an example with Russia? Im all for it and lets go get ISIS because we have to get ISIS and we have to get them fast." "You saw what happened with the priest its only going to get worse, 1066, 1126
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more people from that region into our country and we have no idea who they are where they come from where their documentation is its only going to get worse and its going to start getting bad in our country, 1126, 1174
Were letting people come in by the tens of thousands, 1174, 1184
You see what happened to the French priest, 1184, 1192
A friend of mine he said he was going to France like three four months ago, 1192, 1208
I saw him yesterday, 1208, 1212
I said howd you like France, 1212, 1218
He said I wouldnt go to France, 1218, 1225
I wouldnt go to France, 1225, 1230
Because France is no longer France, 1230, 1236
France is no longer France, 1236, 1241
They wont like me for saying that but you see what happened in Nice you see what happened yesterday with the priest who was supposed to be a spectacular man, 1241, 1271
France is no longer France and this world better be very careful and they better get very tough and very smart and theyll never do it with Hillary Clinton." "And by the way in terms of change shes been there for 30 years, 1271, 1314
Shes been doing this for 30 years, 1314, 1321
What shes going to go all of sudden things are going to change? Shes bought and sold 100 percent by special interests and lobbyists, 1321, 1345
Yes Tom?" , 1345, 1347
  , 1347, 1347
None none, 1347, 1349
  ", 1349, 1350
Because its under order, 1350, 1354
And Ill release them when the audits completed, 1354, 1362
Nobody would release when its under—Ive had audits for 15 or 16 years, 1362, 1375
Every year I have a routine audit, 1375, 1382
Im under audit when the audits complete Ill release them, 1382, 1392
But zero I mean I will tell you right now zero I have nothing to do with Russia yes?" , 1392, 1411
  ", 1411, 1412
I dont know I dont know, 1412, 1418
It depends on the audit, 1418, 1423
It depends on the audit not a big deal, 1423, 1432
By the way just so you understand Ive released my papers 104 pages of documents, 1432, 1447
I built an unbelievable company tremendous cash tremendous company with some of the great assets of the world, 1447, 1465
Youve seen it, 1465, 1468
You were all very disappointed when you saw it actually but thats OK, 1468, 1481
Far far great than anybody ever thought, 1481, 1488
I have a great company, 1488, 1493
I built an unbelievable company but if you look there youll see theres nothing in Russia." "And as far as the tax returns as soon as the audits complete like any lawyer would tell you Greta Van Susteren she was going over it a while ago shes a lawyer, 1493, 1542
She said well no lawyer would let somebody release a tax return when theyre under audit, 1542, 1558
Its a routine audit, 1558, 1562
Ive gone through audits which I think is very unfair for 15 years, 1562, 1575
I have friends that are very rich and never get audited, 1575, 1586
Im audited every year, 1586, 1590
Maybe thats because of politics who knows." , 1590, 1597
  ", 1597, 1598
Im not going to tell Putin what to do, 1598, 1607
Why should I tell Putin what to do? He already did something today where he said dont blame them essentially for your incompetence, 1607, 1630
Let me tell you its not even about Russia or China or whoever it is thats doing the hacking, 1630, 1649
It was about the things that were said in those e-mails, 1649, 1660
They were terrible things talking about Jewish talking about race talking about atheist trying to pin labels on people—what was said was a disgrace and it was Debbie Wasserman Schultz and believe me as sure as youre sitting there Hillary Clinton knew about it, 1660, 1704
She knew everything." "Debbie Wasserman Schultz could not breathe without speaking and getting approval from Hillary Clinton, 1704, 1721
Couldnt breathe, 1721, 1723
And you saw that, 1723, 1727
It also showed that it was a fixed race but Ive been saying that long before I saw the e-mails, 1727, 1747
It was a rigged race, 1747, 1752
It was totally rigged, 1752, 1756
And Debbie Wasserman Schultz rigged it for Hillary Clinton and the sad part is Bernie Sanders has to use an old word that I use on occasion hes lost his energy, 1756, 1787
He wants to go home and go to sleep, 1787, 1796
But hes got a lot of people that walked out last night, 1796, 1808
Now hundreds of people walked out of the Democrat Convention last night, 1808, 1820
I didnt even hear about it, 1820, 1826
Nobody showed it, 1826, 1829
I didnt see it on television, 1829, 1835
You people dont talk about it." The Republican Convention was incredible, 1835, 1846
I hear I had one of the biggest bounces in decades, 1846, 1857
Like some people are saying nine points, 1857, 1864
In fact a poll just came out ten minutes ago "Los Angeles Times" Trump 47 Clinton 40, 1864, 1881
And the reason is that people are sick and tired of Hillary Clinton, 1881, 1894
  Putin say stay out? Why not say that? ", 1894, 1903
Why do I have to get involved with Putin? I have nothing to do with Putin, 1903, 1919
Ive never spoken to him, 1919, 1924
I dont know anything about him other than he will respect me, 1924, 1936
He doesnt respect our president, 1936, 1941
And if it is Russia—which its probably not nobody knows who it is—but if it is Russia its really bad for a different reason because it shows how little respect they have for our country when they would hack into a major party and get everything, 1941, 1987
But it would be interesting to see—I will tell you this—Russia if youre listening I hope youre able to find the 30000 e-mails that are missing, 1987, 2013
I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press, 2013, 2024
Lets see if that happens, 2024, 2029
Thatll be next, 2029, 2032
Yes sir..." , 2032, 2034
  this audience and make our campaign—what exactly do you believe should happen to minimum wage in this country  ? "OK, 2034, 2054
Sure, 2054, 2055
Two big questions, 2055, 2058
The minimum wage has to go up, 2058, 2065
People are—at least $10 but it has to go up, 2065, 2075
But I think that states—federal—I think that states should really call the shot, 2075, 2088
As an example I live in New York, 2088, 2096
Its very expensive in New York, 2096, 2102
You cant buy a hot dog for the money youre talking about, 2102, 2114
You go to other states and its not expensive at all, 2114, 2125
Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up companies move out and things bad things happen, 2125, 2150
At the same time people have to be taken care of, 2150, 2161
But what Im really going to do on the minimum wage—but it has to go up." "Now Bernie Sanders lied, 2161, 2181
Bernie Sanders said in his speech the other day that Donald Trump wants the minimum wage to go below $7, 2181, 2201
I said where did he come up with that one? That one is just like Joe Biden lied today, 2201, 2220
He said that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—he was on television—he said Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb the enemy in the Middle East, 2220, 2245
Now that was Ted Cruz that said that, 2245, 2253
That was not Donald Trump, 2253, 2258
I mean hes not a very bright guy but that was Ted Cruz that said it, 2258, 2274
And he said it with such surety—Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb—I never said I wanted to carpet bomb, 2274, 2293
That was Ted Cruz, 2293, 2297
You remember Ted Cruz said it? You will confirm that I think, 2297, 2309
Go ahead." "So I would like to raise it to at least $10 and what Im going to do is Im going to bring jobs back to this country so that people can start working again so that the $10 and the $15 and the numbers youre talking about are going to—literally theyre going to be peanuts compared to what people can make in the country because Im going to bring jobs back from Mexico which is booming booming, 2309, 2388
I have a friend who builds plants and hes a great builder of plants and I was with him the other day—great guy, 2388, 2411
He builds massive plants for automobiles for computers for anything, 2411, 2421
Thats what he does, 2421, 2425
I think hes the biggest but certainly one of the biggest." "And I said hows it going? He said unbelievable, 2425, 2445
Oh good thats good news, 2445, 2450
The countrys doing well, 2450, 2454
No the countrys not doing well but Mexico is unbelievable, 2454, 2464
The plants Im building in Mexico Ive never seen anything—its the eighth wonder of the world, 2464, 2480
And hes not happy, 2480, 2484
Hes an American guy, 2484, 2488
Hed rather build them here, 2488, 2493
But he said its unbelievable, 2493, 2498
Thats whats happened to our country, 2498, 2504
Because we have leadership that doesnt know what theyre doing." , 2504, 2514
  special extreme vetting? ", 2514, 2518
Yes were going to be listing; yeah were going to be giving a list of those territories, 2518, 2535
And if you come from those territories we have extreme vetting, 2535, 2546
And were going to have extreme vetting anyway, 2546, 2554
Look we have people coming into this country who have very evil intentions, 2554, 2567
And we have people whether in San Bernardino or whether its the World Trade Center or whether its a lot of other things and you look all over the world and you see whats happening." "You look at Orlando how bad was that? And that was horrible, 2567, 2614
That was going after the gay community it looks like, 2614, 2624
We cant let this happen, 2624, 2629
We cannot let this happen, 2629, 2634
We cannot let people come in." "Now Hillary Clinton likes to up it, 2634, 2647
Her running mate Tim Kaine who by the way did a terrible job in New Jersey, 2647, 2663
First act he did in New Jersey was ask for a $4 billion tax increase and hes not very popular in New Jersey, 2663, 2686
And he still isnt, 2686, 2690
What?" "I mean Virginia, 2690, 2694
The first thing he did the first thing that Tim Kaine did he asked for a $4 billion tax increase, 2694, 2714
And hes not very popular, 2714, 2719
So let me just tell you and I went all over Virginia and I was there the other day, 2719, 2738
And I thought hed be popular, 2738, 2744
Hes not popular because he asked for tax increases, 2744, 2753
Big tax increases in Virginia, 2753, 2758
Big, 2758, 2759
And also the unemployment went up I think it doubled or close to doubled during his tenure." "But what he wanted to do is very strongly and hes on record he wanted to have even more of the people from that region of the world come in than Hillary Clinton wants, 2759, 2810
And its unacceptable, 2810, 2813
OK, 2813, 2814
Yes? "  , 2814, 2816
Shortly ago prosecutors in Baltimore announced they were dropping all the charges.., 2816, 2828
I saw that, 2828, 2831
Against police involved in the Freddie Gray case, 2831, 2839
Right, 2839, 2840
Your reaction  ? ", 2840, 2844
I do have a reaction to the prosecutor in Baltimore who indicted those police officers I do, 2844, 2861
I think she ought to prosecute herself OK? Thats my reaction, 2861, 2872
I think it was disgraceful what she did and the way she did it, 2872, 2886
And the news conference that she had where they were guilty before anybody even knew the facts." "And I give a lot of respect and a lot of credit to those police officers who probably could have made a deal, 2886, 2926
I give a lot of respect a lot of credit that they stuck it out, 2926, 2941
And you had victory after victory after victory, 2941, 2949
And she had no chance dont forget she prosecuted the best case what she thought was her best cases first, 2949, 2969
She should prosecute herself, 2969, 2973
She should be held accountable." , 2973, 2978
  to Americans who feel like this was kind of a railroad case, 2978, 2990
Freddie Gray is now a cause celebre, 2990, 2997
", 2997, 2998
Well that was a bad case to prove it, 2998, 3007
That was a bad case, 3007, 3012
I mean if youre going to do that its OK because you have to you know there are times when police officers behave very badly, 3012, 3037
But you have to get the right time, 3037, 3045
This was not one of those times, 3045, 3052
And I think that she is a disgrace to the world of prosecutors for what she did, 3052, 3069
Yes maam?" ", 3069, 3072
So as youve gotten to know Governor Pence what surprises you most about him..." , 3072, 3086
Yeah, 3086, 3087
And  .., 3087, 3089
", 3089, 3090
I have a great relationship with Governor Pence, 3090, 3098
We spent the last three days together, 3098, 3105
He was absolutely my first choice and I never wavered despite the press, 3105, 3118
The press was saying and it was interesting I spoke to him at 11:05 him and his wife and I told him that I was going to be choosing them if Id be lucky enough for him to accept, 3118, 3157
And he accepted, 3157, 3160
And that was it, 3160, 3164
For me that was it." "But right around that time you had the attack in Nice, 3164, 3180
And I was going to have a news conference either the following morning or the next day, 3180, 3197
And of course I had to delay the news conference because there was attack a horrible attack horrible, 3197, 3215
In France, 3215, 3217
And I delayed the news conference and everyone said oh hes having second thoughts, 3217, 3231
I never had a second thought in my life, 3231, 3240
It was such a lie, 3240, 3245
I mean so many lies in the press, 3245, 3253
But it was such a lie, 3253, 3259
And he has been so great, 3259, 3265
Honestly hes been even better than I thought OK? Better." , 3265, 3275
Do you think the Geneva Convention are out of date? ", 3275, 3286
I think everythings is out of date, 3286, 3293
We have a whole new world, 3293, 3299
When I said that NATO to Wolf Blitzer is obsolete I got attacked, 3299, 3312
Three days later people that study NATO said you know Trump is right, 3312, 3325
You know what? We have a lot of things that are out date because theyre 20 and 30 and 40 years old." "NATO you know this isnt a country from 40 years ago, 3325, 3358
Today we have a different threat, 3358, 3364
We have a terror threat, 3364, 3369
And we have an ISIS threat, 3369, 3375
And by the way ISIS isnt even mentioned, 3375, 3383
Its not even mentioned during the Democratic Convention, 3383, 3391
And everyones talking about it, 3391, 3396
The reason they cant mention it is because they grew it." Go ahead, 3396, 3409
What would you renegotiate: the enhanced interrogation aspect of it? The.., 3409, 3420
", 3420, 3421
I would—Katy I would renegotiate so much of everything, 3421, 3430
Im going to renegotiate our trade deals where were losing with everybody Katy, 3430, 3443
Im going to renegotiate our military deals where were protecting countries and theyre not living up to the bargain, 3443, 3462
Theyre not living up to the bargain, 3462, 3469
And everyone agrees with me except for the media." And the media never says that, 3469, 3484
I like NATO just so you understand, 3484, 3491
I like NATO, 3491, 3494
I like the concept of NATO, 3494, 3500
It is somewhat outdated because it doesnt cover terror the way it should, 3500, 3513
Ive been saying this for six months now, 3513, 3521
A couple of months ago front page Wall Street Journal "We are going to cover terror" they announced somebody, 3521, 3540
"I think NATOs great, 3540, 3544
But its got to be modernized, 3544, 3550
And—and countries that were protecting have to pay what theyre supposed to be paying." , 3550, 3564
On the Geneva Convention  , 3564, 3568
Yes? , 3568, 3569
Do you think that they should allow for that given the  ? , 3569, 3581
I am a person that believes in enhanced interrogation yes, 3581, 3591
And by the way it works, 3591, 3597
 " will you defend the Baltic states if theyre invaded by Russia? According to..." ", 3597, 3612
Ill tell you what, 3612, 3616
Let me say it once again, 3616, 3622
Let me say it once again, 3622, 3628
OK? Many countries including the NATO countries some of which I think you have five that are current that have paid what they owe, 3628, 3652
And they can afford to pay this, 3652, 3659
Its not like they cant afford it." "They just see us as a soft touch, 3659, 3674
You know in business we say somebodys a soft touch, 3674, 3684
I dont know if Ive been called a soft touch but maybe I have sometimes, 3684, 3699
But in business they call them a soft touch, 3699, 3708
They havent paid us, 3708, 3712
OK? I want them to pay." "Excuse me, 3712, 3720
Im not saying anything, 3720, 3724
I dont talk, 3724, 3727
Im not like Obama where he tells you everything hes going to do—were going to go and do this; were going to go and do that, 3727, 3753
I dont talk, 3753, 3756
But theyre going to pay." "No no—yeah it sends a signal, 3756, 3767
You know what signal it says? It says were going to pay." You know somebody said "but we have treaties." I said thats right, 3767, 3791
And in the treaties theyre supposed to pay, 3791, 3799
Theyre going to pay, 3799, 3803
And they will pay, 3803, 3807
They will pay, 3807, 3810
  , 3810, 3810
Yes? , 3810, 3811
  how are you planning to  ? ", 3811, 3818
Were going to have a whole policy on that over the next three weeks, 3818, 3832
Im going to be doing a big thing on that."   ", 3832, 3843
Well Ive been doing very well with the Hispanic community, 3843, 3853
I mean really well, 3853, 3857
I mean the—the poll numbers are going up very high, 3857, 3867
I think we had one recently 35 or 36, 3867, 3876
But Im going to have a whole—were going to have a news conference on that over the next three weeks." So and I want to just tell you because these polls cover it so L.A, 3876, 3911
Times 47-40; CNN way up, 3911, 3916
Theyre all way up, 3916, 3920
Biggest—they say the biggest bounce in memory, 3920, 3927
Because today I heard a dishonest guy on television say "Well Trump didnt get much of a bounce." So you know I have to at least say, 3927, 3954
Jeremy go ahead, 3954, 3957
  do you believe that Vladimir Putin would rather deal with President Trump or President Clinton? ", 3957, 3973
I dont think he respects Clinton, 3973, 3979
I dont think Putin has any respect whatsoever for Clinton, 3979, 3989
I think he does respect me, 3989, 3995
And I hope I get along great with him, 3995, 4004
Its possible that we wont Jeremy, 4004, 4010
I hope that we get along great with Putin because it would be great to have Russia with a good relationship." Right now we dont have a good relationship, 4010, 4039
Putin has said things over the last year that are really bad things, 4039, 4052
OK? He mentioned the "N" word one time, 4052, 4060
I was shocked to hear him mention the "N" word, 4060, 4070
You know what the "N" word is right? He mentioned it, 4070, 4081
I was shocked, 4081, 4084
"He has a total lack of respect for President Obama, 4084, 4094
Number one he doesnt like him, 4094, 4100
And number two he doesnt respect him, 4100, 4107
I think hes going to respect your president if Im elected, 4107, 4118
And I hope he likes me." Yes? Yes sir? , 4118, 4127
  relations? , 4127, 4128
Yes sir, 4128, 4130
  , 4130, 4130
But let me finish with Jeremy, 4130, 4136
Go ahead, 4136, 4138
Would a President Trump be better for U.S.-Russia relations than  ? ", 4138, 4150
President Trump would be so much better for U.S.-Russian relations, 4150, 4160
You cant be worse, 4160, 4164
Hey look when I was a young men studying history and studying all of these things that Ive always found fascinating one thing that Ive always heard is you never want to do anything to unite Russia and China, 4164, 4203
Well theyre united now in a true sense, 4203, 4211
Theyve never been closer." "Theyre selling oil to China, 4211, 4220
We forced them into this position."   , 4220, 4226
No wait a minute, 4226, 4230
  ", 4230, 4231
No Im not going to be an adversary, 4231, 4239
No not at all, 4239, 4243
I have tenants from China, 4243, 4248
I have the biggest bank in the world from China paying me rent, 4248, 4261
I mean I have great relationships with China, 4261, 4269
Im not blaming China for getting away with murder, 4269, 4278
Im blaming our leadership is incompetent, 4278, 4284
We dont know what were doing." "I dont blame—I respect China, 4284, 4295
Hey if China can get away with trade deficits every year of hundreds of billions of dollars—if they can get away with that my hats off to them." I have no problem with China, 4295, 4329
I have a problem with our incompetent leadership allowing that to happen, 4329, 4341
And I believe that Hillary Clinton is even more bought and paid for than Barack Obama, 4341, 4357
I think it will get worse, 4357, 4363
"Its going to be four more years of Obama which is unacceptable to a lot of people you see that, 4363, 4383
But I believe that Hillary Clinton will be worse than Obama." Yes? , 4383, 4395
  you mentioned that you wanted to make college education more affordable, 4395, 4406
", 4406, 4407
Thats right." , 4407, 4409
Working on a plan.., 4409, 4413
", 4413, 4414
Thats right Im going to be doing something over the next four weeks very much so." , 4414, 4430
Are you prepared to give us any sort of.., 4430, 4439
", 4439, 4440
No Im prepared to say were gonna have a great plan, 4440, 4451
One of the things I think because Ive traveled all over the country and Im going—you know where Im going I guess you all know I dont have to say." "But Im going to Toledo and Im going to different places today and Ive met so many people, 4451, 4499
This is such a great country these are such great people, 4499, 4510
one of the saddest things I see are college students that work so hard that go to colleges good colleges theyre good students they do a great job." "Number one they get out they have no jobs, 4510, 4547
Because our jobs are going to Mexico theyre going to China theyre going to Japan theyre going all over the place, 4547, 4568
Theyre not coming here, 4568, 4572
Just like my friend who builds the plants but he doesnt build them here much." "And the saddest thing I see is these students are leveraged debt up to their—up to their neck, 4572, 4605
They cant breathe theyre scared theyre so scared they have leveraged their entire life, 4605, 4619
They have loans." And I have to tell you the colleges are viewing the students as just a con to it, 4619, 4640
Because the students get government money passes through but the number gets higher and higher, 4640, 4655
"Because college costs are out of control because the colleges say what difference does it make? If you take a look at the salaries being paid you take a look at whats going on with the colleges." "Because all of this is a pass through and the students are a con to it, 4655, 4708
So the colleges are costing so much money, 4708, 4716
We are going to help the students, 4716, 4723
Maybe that doesnt fit beautifully within the Republican framework." "But I told this during various times to lots of different people and nobody has a problem with it, 4723, 4751
We have to help our students, 4751, 4757
Our students are under tremendous pressure to a point where its making them sick." "Our students are under tremendous pressure we have to help our students, 4757, 4783
And Im going to have a plan over the next four weeks."   , 4783, 4795
  talking about possibly.., 4795, 4798
", 4798, 4799
Everythings on the table youll see, 4799, 4805
Everything—its a very important—its a very important subject." "Yes maam?" , 4805, 4815
Mr, 4815, 4816
Trump  , 4816, 4817
", 4817, 4818
I think my message is resonating because they have confidence on me at the border if they dont want people pouring into our country, 4818, 4842
Likewise they have confidence with me on ISIS not only in terms of getting rid of them but also in terms of keeping them out of our country because I will not have people come into our country who want to do damage to our people." "I think they have a lot of confidence in terms of my bringing back jobs because I see Carrier and I see Ford and I see all of these companies leaving and going to Mexico like theres nothing to it, 4842, 4928
And then they make their product they sell it back to the United States no tax no nothing we get nothing except unemployment." "And I think people see that, 4928, 4957
I can tell you I mean Im like a pollster myself when Im in front of these massive audiences one of the things that gets constantly—you people know because youre there—the biggest applause is a repeal and replacement of Obamacare." "Because Obamacare is a disaster, 4957, 5002
In Texas going through BlueCross/BlueShield they just announced a 60 percent increase, 5002, 5014
On November 1st youre going to have new numbers come out for Obamacare having to do with increases, 5014, 5032
President Obama is trying to get it moved to December, 5032, 5042
Because it is election-defying, 5042, 5046
It is going to be a massive number the biggest number ever in our countrys history for health care, 5046, 5065
Its going to be announced on November 1st." "I just asked the press dont let him do that, 5065, 5083
Obamacare is a disaster people are dying with it, 5083, 5092
Its a disaster and everybody knows and its going to fold anyway." "In 17 unfortunately—if Im president—I mean Ive got to take over this mess, 5092, 5117
Its going to fold anyway, 5117, 5122
But repeal and replace Obamacare people like it." "They like the fact that Im going to protect the Second Amendment they like the fact that Im going to rebuild our military which is very depleted, 5122, 5157
Those are the things that are resonating." "And they dont feel Hillary Clinton can do it." John go ahead John, 5157, 5177
 " Russia has no business in you—that you dont have any..." , 5177, 5188
No I have nothing to do with Russia John, 5188, 5197
How many times do I have say that? Are you a smart man? I have nothing to with Russia I have nothing to do with Russia, 5197, 5223
And even—for anything, 5223, 5226
What do I have to do with Russia? You know the closest I came to Russia I bought a house a number of years ago in Palm Beach Florida, 5226, 5255
Palm Beach is a very expensive place, 5255, 5262
There was a man who went bankrupt and I bought the house for $40 million and I sold it to a Russian for $100 million including brokerage commissions, 5262, 5290
So I sold it, 5290, 5294
So I bought it for 40 I told it for 100 to a Russian, 5294, 5308
That was a number of years ago, 5308, 5315
I guess probably I sell condos to Russians OK? , 5315, 5324
  ", 5324, 5325
Of course I can, 5325, 5329
I told you other than normal stuff—I buy a house if I sold it to a Russian, 5329, 5346
I have nothing to do with Russia, 5346, 5353
I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama but who doesnt know that?" , 5353, 5369
  , 5369, 5369
Of course not, 5369, 5372
I own the Trump organization, 5372, 5377
Zero zero, 5377, 5379
Go ahead, 5379, 5381
  , 5381, 5381
I am, 5381, 5383
  , 5383, 5383
I did, 5383, 5385
  ", 5385, 5386
I did, 5386, 5388
Because I would love to see a woman become president of the United States, 5388, 5402
But she would be so wrong, 5402, 5408
And even women say that, 5408, 5413
Women dont like her, 5413, 5417
She would be so wrong, 5417, 5422
Look Hillary Clinton is a disaster, 5422, 5428
Shes been a disaster, 5428, 5432
And even the story told by her husband last night he left out the most interesting chapter, 5432, 5449
I wont get into that." "The chapter that I really waited for because it was pretty boring the chapter that I waited for I never heard, 5449, 5475
And he left it out, 5475, 5480
Look Hillary Clintons a disaster, 5480, 5485
Id love to see a woman become president and itll happen absolutely, 5485, 5497
But I think it would be bad for women if it were Hillary Clinton, 5497, 5511
Yes maam?" , 5511, 5513
  , 5513, 5513
Yes I do, 5513, 5516
  ", 5516, 5517
But I have spoken to about many times and I speak about it all the time and the police have to be very careful they have to be very very well trained, 5517, 5549
I speak about it all the time in fact I mentioned the most recent death excuse me I mentioned the most recent deaths in Louisiana and in Minnesota, 5549, 5577
I speak about it all the time, 5577, 5584
Its a real problem because if the police do 100000 great jobs and they have one either a rogue policeman or a cop who was poorly trained or did a bad job you see that incident on television for weeks, 5584, 5624
Its a real problem." "You dont see the good work that they do but if they make one mistake out of 100000 out of more than that its on television night after night after night, 5624, 5659
The police in this country do an amazing job but likewise I agree and I do mention that all the time, 5659, 5680
Yes maam go ahead." , 5680, 5684
  , 5684, 5684
Oh go ahead go ahead, 5684, 5689
  , 5689, 5689
Yes, 5689, 5690
  ", 5690, 5691
No but they seem to be if its Russians, 5691, 5700
I have no idea, 5700, 5704
Its probably not Russia, 5704, 5708
Nobody knows if its Russia, 5708, 5713
You know the sad thing is? That with the technology and the genius we have in this country not in government unfortunately but with the genius we have in government we dont even know who took the Democratic National Committee e-mails, 5713, 5754
We dont even know who it is." "I heard this morning one report said they dont think its Russia they think it might be China, 5754, 5779
Another report said it might be just a hacker some guy with a 200 I.Q, 5779, 5794
that cant get up in the morning OK? Nobody knows, 5794, 5804
Honestly they have no idea if its Russia, 5804, 5812
Might be Russia, 5812, 5815
But if its any foreign country it shows how little respect they have for the United States, 5815, 5832
Yes maam." , 5832, 5834
  , 5834, 5834
Yes, 5834, 5835
  ", 5835, 5836
Well and the biggest thing is number one we have to stop by keeping people out because these people theyve got something bad going on up there, 5836, 5863
Thats something really bad going on, 5863, 5869
And then people in terms of Islam and radical Islamic terrorism a term that our president refuses to use I cant hes still not using it, 5869, 5895
Hes still not using it, 5895, 5900
And she doesnt want to use it other than I forced her into maybe using it, 5900, 5916
She said she will use it but so far she didnt." "Shell probably use it tonight, 5916, 5932
Like the American flags as soon as we put out a thing they ran a couple of American flags up in the stage it was a disgrace, 5932, 5959
You had a room with a massive stage without flags, 5959, 5969
I think this—I think that the people in the community know whats going on, 5969, 5983
Whether its in a mosque or whether its in the community and they have to report these people, 5983, 6001
When you look at San Bernardino people knew—many people knew what was going on, 6001, 6015
They had bombs lying all over the floor, 6015, 6023
They had bombs on the floor, 6023, 6029
I mean this isnt—you walk into somebodys house there are bombs lying on the floor—I think theres a problem there, 6029, 6049
You got to report it." And by the way David Hinckley should not have been freed OK? David Hinckley was just released—John Hinckley—I think that John Hinckley—excuse me John Hinckley should not have been freed, 6049, 6084
I just heard about it, 6084, 6089
  ", 6089, 6090
Do you have any pause about asking a foreign government—Russia China anybody—to interfere to hack into the system of anybodys in this country..." ", 6090, 6114
Thats up to the President, 6114, 6119
Let the President talk to them, 6119, 6125
Look heres the problem, 6125, 6129
Heres the problem Katy, 6129, 6133
Katy heres the problem very simple, 6133, 6139
He has no respect..." , 6139, 6143
  30000 e-mails.., 6143, 6145
", 6145, 6146
Well they probably have them, 6146, 6151
Id like to have them released." , 6151, 6157
Does that not give you pause? ", 6157, 6164
No it gives me no pause, 6164, 6170
If they have them they have them, 6170, 6177
We might as well—hey you know what gives me more pause? That a person in our government crooked Hillary Clinton—heres what gives me pause, 6177, 6201
Be quiet, 6201, 6203
I know you want to save her, 6203, 6210
That a person in our government Katy would delete or get rid of 33000 e- mails, 6210, 6226
That gives me a big problem, 6226, 6232
After she gets a subpoena! She gets subpoenaed and she gets rid of 33000 e-mails? That gives me a problem, 6232, 6252
Now if Russia or China or any other country has those e-mails I mean to be honest with you Id love to see them."   , 6252, 6276
A question about Mike Pence because "The New York Times" reported that  " conversation with John Kasichs campaign "  says you can be the most powerful  .., 6276, 6303
", 6303, 6304
Thats the most ridiculous conversation, 6304, 6309
He never had the—Don Jr, 6309, 6314
told me—let me just tell you, 6314, 6320
Let me save you a lot of boredom." , 6320, 6328
 " Mike Pences role as vice president if you are elected?" ", 6328, 6340
Mike Pence will play a big role but I just want to tell you about John Kasich, 6340, 6357
I never spoke to him about being vice president, 6357, 6366
We dont have good chemistry together, 6366, 6372
I have never spoken to him about being vice president, 6372, 6382
I would never pick him to be vice president, 6382, 6391
There was never a conversation and he has a habit of doing things like this where he says things that may be a little bit shaky, 6391, 6417
He never spoke—Don Jr, 6417, 6421
would never—and that was so long ago I didnt even know I was going to get the nomination at that point, 6421, 6442
Just so you understand I would not have picked John Kasich wouldnt be the right guy, 6442, 6458
I mean for that to have gotten out that was so ridiculous, 6458, 6470
And then I was going to put him in charge of national and worldwide policy, 6470, 6485
So whats left for the president? I think you know me better than that, 6485, 6499
That was put out by him, 6499, 6505
Hes a nice man John Kasich hes fine, 6505, 6513
Hes fine, 6513, 6515
I would never have chosen him." Now I did speak to various people and I actually got acceptances from many people, 6515, 6536
There are some people that called me that very much wanted to be vice president but I picked a man that I have a lot of respect for and Mike Pence is doing a great job, 6536, 6572
"Let me just explain—I never asked John Kasich to be vice president nor would I, 6572, 6587
And by the way Im leading in Ohio by three points." , 6587, 6598
  ", 6598, 6599
It probably has, 6599, 6602
It probably has, 6602, 6605
Our government is so weak on this stuff, 6605, 6613
It probably has, 6613, 6616
Possible, 6616, 6617
I mean I have a lot of checks and balance, 6617, 6627
I have a good system I guess, 6627, 6634
Im not an e- mail person myself, 6634, 6641
I dont believe in it because I think it can be hacked for one thing, 6641, 6656
But when I send an e-mail I mean if I send one I send one almost never, 6656, 6673
Im just not a believer in e-mail, 6673, 6680
A lot of people have taught me that including Hillary, 6680, 6690
But honestly it could be maybe its hacked, 6690, 6698

OK, 6733, 6734

Youve broken that tradition youve run a very aggressive campaign this week, 6735, 6747
What was the basis for wanting to do it this way as opposed to staying quiet..." , 6747, 6763
No basis, 6763, 6765
No basis, 6765, 6767
"Look John I didnt have to do this, 6767, 6775
When I did this believe me—you see this incredible resort, 6775, 6785
Its one of the great in the world, 6785, 6793
When I did this I could be here enjoying myself, 6793, 6803
I dont have to be with you guys, 6803, 6811
I didnt need this, 6811, 6815
I have places that are the best in the world OK, 6815, 6826
I could be doing other things, 6826, 6832
Im doing this because were going to make America great again, 6832, 6843
Im doing this because when I looked at the Iran deal which was incompetent—when I looked at whats going on with jobs being torn out of our country and going to Mexico and China whats happening with China, 6843, 6881
And with all of this with ISIS with our military being so badly depleted where we have old fighter jets, 6881, 6901
We have to take parts from museums and from graveyards." "When I look at all this I say I sort of have to do it, 6901, 6926
You know this countrys been great to me, 6926, 6934
Im giving back, 6934, 6937
Thats all." "Now as far as running a campaign I guess its probably not typical, 6937, 6952
But they said that against you know when I ran there was 17 people a total of 17, 6952, 6970
Governors Senators Ben Carson whos a fantastic guy capable people, 6970, 6980
Wait a minute, 6980, 6983
Everybody said oh he can never win because look what hes doing, 6983, 6995
Hes giving a talk to 5000 people in New Hampshire instead of going to everybodys house and having dinner." And then I won New Hampshire, 6995, 7020
And then I won you know 38 or 39 states, 7020, 7030
And won by the way not by a little bit, 7030, 7040
Won with the highest vote in the history of the Republican Party, 7040, 7052
So just.., 7052, 7054
  ", 7054, 7055
OK but John but the point is this so its a different kind of a campaign, 7055, 7071
But its what I think is good, 7071, 7078
I think its good, 7078, 7082
I think its working here too." ", 7082, 7089
But this aggressive counterprogramming the Democratic Convention is different than what weve seen in previous campaigns, 7089, 7105
And Im wondering why you felt the need to make sure that everything that was said was responded to immediately with personal appearances with campaign appearances while they were " .., 7105, 7136

Well when Joe Biden says that I want to firebomb the enemy which was on television this morning or carpet bomb, 7137, 7158
He used the term carpet bomb, 7158, 7164
When he makes the statement that Donald Trump wants to carpet bomb I never said that, 7164, 7180
That was Ted Cruz that said that OK? That was Ted Cruz wasnt me." "When Sanders and I think a lot of his people are going to come to me because of trade, 7180, 7213
But when Bernie Sanders makes a statement that I wanted to go lower than the minimum wage lower its a lie, 7213, 7234
So I have a choice, 7234, 7239
All my people say dont respond to it it doesnt matter, 7239, 7250
I say to me it does matter, 7250, 7257
It matters." "When people tell lies politicians who tell lies very well thats what they do thats why theyre politicians, 7257, 7277
But when politicians tell lies and Im lucky in a sense because I have a big microphone, 7277, 7294
In other words I can say that Biden lied when he said that, 7294, 7307
Or I can say that I didnt say that Bernie Sanders, 7307, 7318
And you guys know that I didnt, 7318, 7325
In fact he was criticized by people that fact check for saying it because I never said it." So its nice to be able to President Obama said a year-and-a- half ago Donald Trump will never be president, 7325, 7363
Today on "The Today Show" he said this is democracy, 7363, 7373
A little bit different, 7373, 7377
Little bit different, 7377, 7380
  David go ahead Dave, 7380, 7384
Last night at the Democratic Convention   women and gay advocates made strong cases that you and the Republican Party are kind of on the wrong side of history regarding abortion rights and gay marriage, 7384, 7418
Can you clarify your position on those? ", 7418, 7426
Youll have to see it in the polls David, 7426, 7435

You ask the question every single time, 7462, 7469
I give you an answer, 7469, 7474
My positions are down, 7474, 7478

Didnt you hold a Miss Universe Pageant—?" , 7484, 7491
Yes I did, 7491, 7494
Did Don Jr, 7494, 7497
say back in 2008 that there was Russian money pouring into the top organizations.., 7497, 7511
", 7511, 7512
We wanted to yeah I dont know what he said, 7512, 7522
But we wanted..."   , 7522, 7525
Excuse me listen, 7525, 7528
We wanted to; we were doing Miss Universe 4 or 5 years ago in Russia, 7528, 7543
It was a tremendous success, 7543, 7548
Very very successful, 7548, 7551
And there were developers in Russia that wanted to put a lot of money into developments in Russia, 7551, 7569
And they wanted us to do it, 7569, 7576
But it never worked out, 7576, 7581
"Frankly I didnt want to do it for a couple of different reasons, 7581, 7594
But we had a major developer particular but numerous developers that wanted to develop property in Moscow and other places, 7594, 7614
But we decided not to do it."   ", 7614, 7622
Yes maam go ahead." , 7622, 7626
  President Obama has said that you would never win the presidency, 7626, 7637
Last night he said that anything is possible, 7637, 7645
He did say that, 7645, 7649
What is your reaction to that? ", 7649, 7656
Well I just said sort of said that, 7656, 7664
He just said that, 7664, 7668
He said it this morning anythings possible, 7668, 7675
I think Im going to win, 7675, 7681
I think people are sick and tired of incompetence, 7681, 7690
Theyre sick and tired of having politicians leading them down the tubes, 7690, 7702
Whether its taxes whether its debt whether its any one of 15 different things, 7702, 7716
And thats why, 7716, 7719
I mean I think Ill win the election, 7719, 7727
I think youll see that in the polls." All right a few more questions, 7727, 7741
Go ahead John, 7741, 7744
Back in December.., 7744, 7747
", 7747, 7748
I hope your arms OK." ", 7748, 7754
Its all right, 7754, 7757
Back in December sir you had said that you were probably going to be going to Israel to go and meet the leadership, 7757, 7780
Now that you are the Republican nominee it is a tradition once you secure the Partys nomination to do a trip..." ", 7780, 7802
Well its a tradition but I dont do things that are traditional, 7802, 7814
But I have great support from Israel, 7814, 7821
I will back Israel 100 percent, 7821, 7827
I would like to go there, 7827, 7833
But I have great relationships as you know to the people in Israel." "And by the way Obama in my opinion is the single worst thing politically speaking thats ever happened to Israel, 7833, 7866
He has been a disaster for Israel."   ", 7866, 7874
I dont know, 7874, 7877
I dont know, 7877, 7880
I havent set my schedule yet, 7880, 7886
It could happen." , 7886, 7889
 " you are the nominee, 7889, 7894
Has you or your campaign had any conversations with foreign leaders trying to build up a relationship should you win in November that you dont have to hit the ground running " ? ", 7894, 7928
No I think we—its possible we have, 7928, 7935
But Im not—Im only interested in winning, 7935, 7942
Once I win Ill get along great with foreign leaders but they wont be taking advantage, 7942, 7958
I mean the problem we have with foreign leaders whether its China Russia or anybody they dont respect our leadership, 7958, 7978
And certainly in the case of China they take tremendous economic advantage of us—tremendous to a point that is hard to believe." "Ill get along great with the leadership, 7978, 8007
And well do well." "Yes maam in the back?" , 8007, 8016
Mr, 8016, 8017
Trump     , 8017, 8018
No no, 8018, 8020
Excuse me, 8020, 8022
In the back? , 8022, 8025
I would like to know if you became president would you recognize   Crimea as Russian territory? And also if the U.S, 8025, 8046
would lift sanctions that are  ? ", 8046, 8053
Well be looking at that, 8053, 8058
Yeah well be looking." Go ahead, 8058, 8064
Mr, 8064, 8065
Trump   questions, 8065, 8067
First a quick one on the minimum wage, 8067, 8075
You said we need to raise it to $10, 8075, 8084
  be clear here, 8084, 8087
Are you talking about the federal minimum wage? , 8087, 8095
Federal, 8095, 8096
OK, 8096, 8097
Second question about  , 8097, 8100
Right, 8100, 8101
You said  , 8101, 8103
Would religion be a part of the  ? ", 8103, 8112
Im not making it a part, 8112, 8118
But at some point maybe people will change their minds but as of right now Im not making it a part." OK, 8118, 8140
  ", 8140, 8141
Yes maam? Go ahead." , 8141, 8145
  , 8145, 8145
Who said that? , 8145, 8148
  , 8148, 8148
Who? , 8148, 8149
  ", 8149, 8150
I think President Obama has been the most ignorant president in our history, 8150, 8163
His views of the world as he says dont jive, 8163, 8173
And the world is a mess, 8173, 8179
You look at whats happening with the migration with Syria with Libya with Iraq with everything hes touched, 8179, 8197
He has been a disaster as a president, 8197, 8205
He will go down as one of the worst presidents in the history of our country, 8205, 8221
It is a mess." And I believe that Hillary Clinton will be even worse, 8221, 8235
Go ahead, 8235, 8237
  polls you  , 8237, 8239
You just said  , 8239, 8242
Oh  " just said that? Many polls show that you are winning? I cant believe it, 8242, 8258
Are you Katy Turek of NBC? Its a disguise." Go ahead, 8258, 8269
  , 8269, 8269
Many polls show you  , 8269, 8273
He said he feels that you are   not prepared to be president, 8273, 8285
Can you   lay out for us and for him what you do on a daily basis? How does your  ? , 8285, 8305
OK, 8305, 8306
Well  , 8306, 8307
  , 8307, 8307
 " about whats going on "  and domestic affairs, 8307, 8316
", 8316, 8317
Sure, 8317, 8318
Well youve been asking me a lot of questions for a lot of times, 8318, 8332
Ive turned out to be right, 8332, 8338
I turned out to be right on NATO, 8338, 8346
After I said that on NATO NATO changed their whole program because of me." "Excuse me Katy Hillary Clinton said yesterday shes going to start renegotiating trade deals, 8346, 8374
She never said that in her life, 8374, 8381
She said it yesterday only because of me, 8381, 8389
Im the one thats prepared, 8389, 8394
President Obama when he became president he didnt know anything, 8394, 8404
This guy didnt know a thing, 8404, 8410
And honestly today he knows less, 8410, 8416
Today he knows less." "Hes done a terrible job, 8416, 8425
I think Im very prepared." "Now with that being said Ive been a businessman all my life but Ive been watching it, 8425, 8447
Ive been seeing it, 8447, 8451
Ive been feeling, 8451, 8454
And as you know Ive been very much involved in politics from the other side, 8454, 8469
I understand politics or I guess I wouldnt be here, 8469, 8479
I mean I beat a lot of very talented people." , 8479, 8489
  advisers though? ", 8489, 8492
I do, 8492, 8494
I have great foreign advisers, 8494, 8499
And you have a list, 8499, 8504
And I gave you a list, 8504, 8510
And the other day as an example General Quinn and General Flynn and we have so many—we have so many, 8510, 8530
As an example I had a meeting three or four days ago and Im going to do a report on it with seven or eight very very talented advisers." Now with all of that being said a lot of people want the people that are doing it now; people that have certain names, 8530, 8583
Look at the mess theyve gotten us into, 8583, 8591
They said "Have you spoken to so and so?" Well I said but he was in favor of the war in Iraq many years ago which I was not in favor of, 8591, 8623
"Have you spoken to this one or that one?" I said they were all—look at the job theyve done, 8623, 8642
So a lot of the people that you think are good because you know their name or because you see them on television I dont think are good, 8642, 8670
Because look at the end result, 8670, 8676
The end result is our country is a mess, 8676, 8685
The Middle East has never been worse, 8685, 8692
Had we done nothing with the Middle East; had our presidents with an "S" gone to the beach and relaxed wed be in better shape than we are right now, 8692, 8722
All right Tom, 8722, 8725
A couple more, 8725, 8728
Go ahead Tom, 8728, 8731
 " security briefings, 8731, 8734
Youre about to get one." , 8734, 8739
Yeah, 8739, 8740
Do you expect your opinion on   or your opinion on  , 8740, 8750
", 8750, 8751
Well well have to see, 8751, 8756
I mean thats my opinion, 8756, 8761
Thats my opinion, 8761, 8764
Well have to see, 8764, 8768
I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton who gives open access to a phony server is allowed to get these briefings, 8768, 8790
How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when shes been probably hacked when so much of her information the director of the FBI said it was essentially negligent, 8790, 8820
It was negligent." "Now why are they giving her briefings why are these people with great knowledge of the inner workings of our country and our security why are they giving Hillary Clinton briefings? Because its going to get revealed, 8820, 8860
I mean her number one person Huma Abedin is married to Anthony Weiner whos a sleazeball and a pervert, 8860, 8879
And Im not saying that I mean thats recorded history right?" "I dont like Huma going home at night and telling Anthony Weiner all of these secrets OK? So how can Hillary Clinton be briefed on this unbelievably delicate information when it was just proven that she lied and that her server shouldnt have had it and that theyre missing 33000 e-mails and thats just the beginning, 8879, 8946
So I dont think that I know at some point theyre going to be calling theyre going to want to brief me but Im not a talker about this stuff." "I dont think that its safe to have Hillary Clinton in light of what just happened and in light of what we just found out I dont think its safe to have Hillary Clinton be briefed on national security because the word will get out." , 8946, 9021
  ", 9021, 9022
No, 9022, 9023
Hes not going to run for mayor, 9023, 9030
Oh Don? Hes not going to run for mayor, 9030, 9039
Don has no attention of running for mayor, 9039, 9047
But he did a great job the other night with his speech, 9047, 9059
Because he made a good speech everyone says he should run for mayor, 9059, 9072
You know why? Because we have a Democratic mayor whos horrible hes doing a horrible job de Blasio, 9072, 9090
But Don is not going to run for—he has no interest in running for mayor." , 9090, 9105
  , 9105, 9105
Yes, 9105, 9106
 , 9106, 9106
  ", 9106, 9107
Unbelievable what he said, 9107, 9111
I think its disgraceful, 9111, 9115
Hillary Clinton because of me said that TPP is not going to happen, 9115, 9128
But we all know it is going to happen if she won, 9128, 9140
Terry McAuliffe said with a wink that if Hillary gets in shes lying and it will happen, 9140, 9157
And there is nobody closer I know this for a fact there is nobody including her own husband closer to Hillary Clinton than Terry McAuliffe OK? Go ahead." , 9157, 9185
  ", 9185, 9186
Oh I dont know what he said Jon I really—Anthony Weiners—look look look—Anthony Weiner is a proven loser, 9186, 9204
I mean the poor guy hes locked up in a room, 9204, 9215
They lock him up in a room they dont let him out, 9215, 9227
I dont know what Anthony—my son doesnt want to run for mayor, 9227, 9239
He has no intention of running for mayor." "And besides that as a Republican you have a very tiny sliver in Manhattan as you know and in that area, 9239, 9268
Its almost impossible for a Republican to win, 9268, 9276
So and my son likes to win but my son has no intention of running for mayor so lets just put that to bed, 9276, 9300
Go ahead." , 9300, 9302
  , 9302, 9302
Yes in   very sad, 9302, 9306
Not  , 9306, 9307
  ", 9307, 9308
Yes Im looking at it, 9308, 9313
I actually want to find out what causes it, 9313, 9322
Its a problem in many areas OK? Yes go ahead." , 9322, 9332
  , 9332, 9332
Well they shouted—you know what was interesting, 9332, 9339
Yesterday I made a speech in front of the great veterans as you saw and it was very well received she was there the day before, 9339, 9365
And when I started talking about Hillary Clinton the veterans who saw her 24 hours before started screaming "Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up." They also screamed that as you know during the speech I made, 9365, 9404
The big speech, 9404, 9407
And I said "Dont do that." Now I didnt do that for any reason, 9407, 9421
I really—I didnt like it, 9421, 9426
And they stopped, 9426, 9429
Not one reporter said that I said that, 9429, 9437
They all said—they started screaming "Lock her up! Lock her up." I said "Dont do that." Nobody reported that I said that because its dishonest reporting, 9437, 9463
You do agree I said that right? , 9463, 9470
You did say that, 9470, 9474
", 9474, 9475
OK, 9475, 9476
Well why didnt somebody report that?" ", 9476, 9483
Thats what I want to ask you about you said you..." ", 9483, 9495
No I think its—I think its a shame that they said it but a lot of people would say that should happen." "OK one more question yes—yes maam go ahead." , 9495, 9525
Yes three weeks is a long time to wait for that   immigration, 9525, 9537
This is Doral it was built by.., 9537, 9544
", 9544, 9545
Well Doral is great, 9545, 9549
And Doral—I think I have over 1000 Hispanics working at Doral and theyre doing a great job." "Yes maam in the yellow go ahead, 9549, 9573
Yellow." , 9573, 9574
I have another question, 9574, 9578
Excuse me, 9578, 9580
Yellow, 9580, 9581
", 9581, 9582
Hillary Clintons running mate..." , 9582, 9586
Who? ", 9586, 9588
Hillary Clintons running mate speaks Spanish, 9588, 9594
Do you think this "  an advantage on.., 9594, 9602
", 9602, 9603
No I dont think it has any impact, 9603, 9611
Hes been very bad—her running mate has been very very bad on employment, 9611, 9624
And all you have to do is go to Virginia and speak to the people of Virginia he has been so bad." "I figured when she chose him he was very popular in Virginia, 9624, 9658
They dont like him, 9658, 9662
They dont like him, 9662, 9666
It has been very close races and his polling is very bad." "So ladies and gentlemen thank you very much, 9666, 9686
I think its time for Hillary Clinton to do a news conference because its almost a year now and it would be interesting to see how she does." Thank you all very much, 9686, 9719
  running for the president  ? , 9719, 9724
Might as well tell him to have a good time, 9724, 9734
He has done one bad job, 9734, 9740
OK thank you everybody, 9740, 9744
