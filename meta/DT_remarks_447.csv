Thank you, 0, 2
It is so great to be back in Iowa, 2, 11
Spending time in your state has been one of the great joys of this campaign, 11, 26
Together we are going to win Iowa in November -- and we are going to win the White House and Make America Great Again, 26, 50
"The White House will become the Peoples House, 50, 58
We will tackle and fix the problems that have gone unsolved for years." We are going to fix our crumbling infrastructure renegotiate our disastrous trade deals free children from failing government schools eliminate government waste and create a fair simple and efficient tax code that adds millions of new jobs, 58, 108
Prosperity will rise poverty will recede and wages will finally begin to grow – and they will grow rapidly, 108, 127
This is a campaign about big ideas designed to help everyday people, 127, 139
"In recent days weve rolled out one new policy idea after another – on taxes on school choice on foreign policy on defeating terrorism on rebuilding our military on Veterans care on unleashing American energy and on the vital issue of trade." By contrast Hillary Clinton is running a policy-free campaign, 139, 190
She offers no ideas no solutions only hatred and derision, 190, 200
I am running to be a President for all Americans – Democrat Republican Independent everyone, 200, 215
Whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else I will be your greatest champion, 215, 233
Our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life, 233, 246
We have the support of cops and soldiers carpenters and welders accountants and lawyers the young and the old and millions of working class families all over this nation, 246, 275
While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people, 275, 304
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State hide and delete her emails put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to Congress and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation, 304, 352
"Its this attitude of arrogance that explains why Hillary Clinton made her 13 phones disappear – including with a hammer – so the FBI couldnt see them and why she bleached her emails after a congressional subpoena, 352, 389
Now the people who destroyed the emails are all pleading the fifth amendment in front of Congress today." "Anyone watching todays hearing in Congress knows that Hillary Clintons actions are far more corrupt than we even imagined." "This is a far bigger scandal than Watergate ever was but with Watergate we had the Justice Department doing its jobs – here we dont have either, 389, 453
This is a scandal that threatens national security and that involves a multimillion dollar pay-for-play scheme between the Secretary of State and her Foundation." "Whether its her emails her disasters in Iraq Libya and Syria or her failures on the economy Hillary Clinton lacks the judgement temperament and moral character to lead this country." In the words of a secret service agent posted outside her office: "she simply lacks the integrity and the temperament to serve in the office…from the bottom of my soul I know this to be true." The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced death and destruction overseas and produced only failing schools rising crime job loss shrinking incomes and tragic poverty at home, 453, 570
1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force, 570, 585
Another 14 million people left the labor force entirely since 2009, 585, 596
And the national debt has doubled to nearly $20 trillion during the Obama Years, 596, 610
I am running to reverse these policies and to create a future of prosperity for all Americans, 610, 627
That includes our family farms right here in Iowa, 627, 636
Family farms are the backbone of this country, 636, 644
We are going to end the EPA intrusion into your family homes and your family farms, 644, 660
We are going to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard corn-based ethanol eliminate job-killing regulations like the Waters of the U.S, 660, 680
rule and provide desperately-needed tax relief, 680, 686
Our plan lowers the tax rate on family farms down to 15 percent and to stop the double-taxation of family farms at death – helping to ensure that the family farm tradition in Iowa continues to thrive and flourish, 686, 725
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs jobs jobs, 725, 738
That means we are going to negotiate trade deals to protect our farmers help them export their goods and grow family farming in America, 738, 762
My first day in office I am also going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years, 762, 785
All needless job-killing regulations will be cancelled, 785, 792
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in, 792, 800
We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means lower electricity prices for our farmers and half a million new jobs a year, 800, 827
"Thats just the beginning." Also on my first day I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs, 827, 863
By the way remember when Jonathan Gruber the architect of Obamacare said the "lack of transparency" was essential to passing the legislation and then he talked about – and I quote – "the stupidity of the American voter." This is the hateful attitude of insiders like Mr, 863, 910
Gruber and Hillary Clinton – and the voters have had enough, 910, 921
Theyre taking their country back, 921, 926
"Another major reform is going to be school choice, 926, 935
Ive outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private public magnet or religious school of his or her choice." This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty, 935, 976
"Its time to break-up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation." Our policies on taxes trade regulations and education will grow incomes boost jobs and reduce poverty for our African-American and Hispanic communities, 976, 1023
We need a new civil rights agenda for our time one that promises safe neighborhoods great education and secure jobs, 1023, 1043
Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty including 45% of African-American children under the age of six, 1043, 1062
58% of African-American youth are not working, 1062, 1069
"Violent crime rose in Americas fifty largest cities last year, 1069, 1079
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 1079, 1087
and more than 60% in Baltimore." "Over 3000 people have been shot in Chicago since January of this year, 1087, 1106
Theres a shooting on average every 2 hours." To those suffering and hurting I say: what do you have to lose – vote for Donald J, 1106, 1132
Trump, 1132, 1133
I will fix it, 1133, 1137
I will bring back millions of jobs higher wages and great schools, 1137, 1149
I will make your communities safe, 1149, 1155
Safety also means protecting our people from Radical Islamic Terrorism, 1155, 1165
New video has just been released showing ISIS butchers murdering innocent people in what has been called a Syrian slaughterhouse, 1165, 1185
The victims were dragged then hung from meathooks and then their throats were slit, 1185, 1199
This is an evil sadistic monstrous enemy and we must keep these killers out of our country, 1199, 1216
We know that ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows and to recruit refugees after their entry to our country, 1216, 1236
My opponent wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees, 1236, 1245
According to the Senate Subcommittee on immigration her entire plan will bring in 620000 refugees in her first term and cost $400 billion in lifetime benefits, 1245, 1271
Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to refugees from around the world we should rebuild our inner cities and help struggling Americans get jobs, 1271, 1296
I support the construction of safe zones in the region and we will get the Gulf States to pay for it, 1296, 1317
At the same time as we rebuild our military we are going to get our allies to pay their fair share, 1317, 1338
Only 5 of the 28 member NATO countries meet their obligation to spend 2% of GDP on defense, 1338, 1356
I will convene a summit of our European and Asian allies to make sure everyone is sharing in the security burden – and that we are properly focused on Radical Islamic Terrorism, 1356, 1388
"In all things its time to put Americans first – and start taking care of each other." Tonight I am going to roll out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality childcare for their children, 1388, 1428
On policy after policy we are going to provide opportunity prosperity and security for all Americans, 1428, 1444
"I am going to lower your taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life; Im going to repeal and replace Obamacare; Im going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; Im going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; Im going to save your 2nd amendment, 1444, 1509
Im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall and Im going to so importantly renegotiate your horrible trade deals especially NAFTA – which is the single worst trade deal ever made by any country anywhere in the world a one-way street for jobs out of the United States – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first." And Apple and our other major companies will start making their iPhones computers and other products inside of the United States – not in China and all over the world, 1509, 1612
"We dont make our products anymore in the United States but we will again – like never before." We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1612, 1642
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1642, 1662
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1662, 1671
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy mined from American sources will power this nation, 1671, 1689
American workers will be hired to do the job, 1689, 1698
We will put new American metal into the spine of this country, 1698, 1710
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People, 1710, 1734
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1734, 1755
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 1755, 1777
Jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores, 1777, 1793
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 1793, 1806
We Will Make America Prosperous Again, 1806, 1812
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1812, 1818
And Will Make America Great Again, 1818, 1824
Thank you and God Bless! , 1824, 1829
