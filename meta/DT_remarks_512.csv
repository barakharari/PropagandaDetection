Thank you, 0, 2
In 18 days we are going to win the state of Pennsylvania and we are going to win the White House, 2, 23
But you have to vote on November 8th, 23, 31
"Our opponents have spent more money than ever before in the history of campaigns – raised from special interests – and yet we are leading in the polls from Rasmussen LA Times and Investors Business Daily." Together we are going to deliver real change that puts America First, 31, 79
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes and regulations end Common Core and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare, 79, 116
"Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration, 116, 125
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration, 125, 134
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration, 134, 144
Your companies wont be leaving Pennsylvania under a Trump Administration." We are also going to rebuild our badly depleted military, 144, 164
"Our Navy is the smallest its been since World War I, 164, 175
My plan will build the 350 ship Navy we need, 175, 185
This will be the largest effort at rebuilding our military since Ronald Reagan and it will require a truly national effort, 185, 206
The Philadelphia Navy Yard is a perfect example, 206, 214
I will instruct my Secretary of the Navy to study locations like Philadelphia with a long history of service to our military and proximity to vibrant private industry and find ways to involve them in this national effort." "As our fleet is rebuilt well need to invest in recruiting the skilled American craftsmen we need like welders and pipe fitters and so much more." "We will establish centers of excellence in places like Philadelphia and Portsmouth New Hampshire and Hampton Roads in Virginia to produce the master craftsmen we need to rebuild our Fleet." We will rebuild our navy and we will do it with American steel made right here in Pennsylvania, 214, 326
As part of our plan for bold change to make your life better we will also rebuild our massively depleted infrastructure, 326, 347
"Obama-Clinton doubled the national debt in 8 years – but instead of rebuilding America the money was all lost and Americas infrastructure is like that of a third-world country." "Were also spending $6 trillion dollars in the Middle East with nothing to show for it." Imagine if we had spent this money rebuilding the inner cities of Philadelphia, 347, 405
"Instead we spent trillions on foreign countries and left our own to crumble, 405, 418
We defend other countries borders invest in their resources but abandon our own, 418, 431
The plan I am proposing targets substantial new investment here at home to fix Americas transportation drinking water and other vital infrastructure, 431, 453
This can be achieved through a focus on public-private partnerships proven financing programs and tax credits that incentivize companies to make major job-and-wealth producing investments in the local economy." This means help for projects like the Pennsylvania Turnpike as well as the Pennsylvania portion of the Appalachian Highway System, 453, 502
My plan will also help Pennsylvania upgrade or replace bridges in the Commonwealth that have been deemed "structurally deficient." We are also going to unleash the power of American energy right here in Pennsylvania – shale oil natural gas and clean coal, 502, 544
We are putting Pennsylvania back to work and we are putting the special interests out of work, 544, 561
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA stop the TPP and stand up to foreign product dumping and currency manipulation, 561, 580
Your city has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton, 580, 601
70000 factories have shut down or left the United States since China entered the World Trade Organization, 601, 618
Just a few miles from here theres a very famous bridge that says: "Trenton Makes The World Takes." Under a Trump Administration I can promise you: we are going to start making things in America again – and we are going to start making things in Pennsylvania again, 618, 666
Your products will be sent around the world not your jobs, 666, 677
Hillary is controlled by special interests who want to ship your jobs to other countries, 677, 692
"Shes the most corrupt person ever to run for President." She bleached and deleted 33000 emails – after a Congressional subpoena – lied under oath to Congress lied to the FBI obstructed justice made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer – and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence have mysteriously gone missing, 692, 747
"Now from WikiLeaks weve just learned she tried to get $12 million dollars from the King of Morocco for an appearance – more pay-for-play." That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again, 747, 789
"Its time to drain the swamp in Washington D.C." One new proposal I am outlining today will help us put the corrupt regulation industry out of business, 789, 816
I will work with Congress to require that for every 1 new regulation 2 old regulations must be eliminated, 816, 835
"Were losing $2 trillion dollars in economic activity a year to regulations – the only people getting rich are the lobbyists lawyers and special interests." I am also going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress, 835, 879
Not only will we end government corruption but we will end economic stagnation, 879, 892
My plan lowers our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent, 892, 904
We are also going to rebuild our inner cities, 904, 913
African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering, 913, 923
The violence is unbearable, 923, 927
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot, 927, 939
There is no education there are no jobs there is no safety, 939, 951
Nearly 3500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, 951, 965
"Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 965, 973
and more than 60% in Baltimore, 973, 979
And its getting worse." To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, 979, 1002
I will fix it, 1002, 1006
We will take care of our inner cities and we will bring safety prosperity and security to the people of Philadelphia, 1006, 1027
We will be a rich nation once again, 1027, 1035
But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country, 1035, 1048
National security begins at the border, 1048, 1054
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." "Hillarys plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores." She even wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees, 1054, 1106
"So let me state this as clearly as I can, 1106, 1116
If Im elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country." We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration, 1116, 1141
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders, 1141, 1150
And yes we will build a wall, 1150, 1157
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, 1157, 1169
It was just reported that a man deported from our country 10 times in six years has been charged with raping a 12-year old girl, 1169, 1194
In August Texas Police arrested a serial illegal immigrant rapist who had been deported five times one victim included a 68 year-old woman with a cane who took his offer to drive her home, 1194, 1228
He left her on the side of a dirt road, 1228, 1238
A 64 year-old Air Force Veteran Marilyn Pharis was raped and beaten to death with a hammer by a repeat-offending criminal illegal immigrant who should have been deported – but never was, 1238, 1270
"If Im elected we will impose tough new mandatory minimum federal prison sentences for anyone who illegally re-enters the country after previously being deported, 1270, 1294
And we will swiftly remove and deport all criminal aliens from this country and dismantle the gangs and cartels preying on our citizens." Either we win this election or we lose the country, 1294, 1327
A victory in November will be a victory for you the American people, 1327, 1340
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1340, 1425
For the next 18 days you have to get every last person you know out to the voting booths, 1425, 1444
This is our one magnificent chance to reclaim our country for We The People, 1444, 1458
I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation, 1458, 1475
"Im going to fight for every child living in poverty." "Im going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence." "Im going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Pennsylvania and shipped to other countries." "Im going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests." And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1475, 1565
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1565, 1586
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 1586, 1600
Youre going to remember this day." "This is a movement like youve never seen before." "Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote youve ever cast for anyone at any time." "If we win the change youve been waiting for will finally arrive." We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1600, 1659
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1659, 1665
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1665, 1671
And We Will Make America Great Again, 1671, 1678
