18 months ago my son Eric Garner died at the hands of men who were supposed to protect him.?Eric was unarmed when a police officer choked him to death.? "We repeated those words when we marched for justice for my son—justice were still waiting on.?Along with too many others Erics death has forced our country to confront the effects of police brutality, 0, 62
Weve got to do something about the violence in our communities—especially gun violence—and the racial and economic injustice thats connected to it.?" "Hillary seems to be the only candidate right now whos talking about how we can be strategic in trying to solve this problem, 62, 107
Thats why Im endorsing her for president." Most people remember my sons death but I remember his life, 107, 125
I like to look back on Eric as a child at Christmastime—he was a lover of the Christmas season, 125, 144
One year he and his brother wanted Big Wheels (you remember those cars? they were the thing) and when they saw them Christmas morning their eyes lit up: "Oh baby! Oh wow!" Eric turned to his brother and said "Now I know we are rich." "We werent rich, 144, 192
We lived in public housing, 192, 197
But that day it felt like we were, 197, 205
Eric was a joy to me to his wife and to his own children, 205, 219
It hurt so much to lose him." "I think all of us need to make the time to be involved in this election, 219, 242
With all the violence and injustice thats upon us today we need a candidate who can move us forward—thats Hillary, 242, 262
We need to elect her not just for us but for our children our grandchildren and their children, 262, 280
We have to bring forth a legacy that will outlive us." Stand up today and be a part of that.? , 280, 300
