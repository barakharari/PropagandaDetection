"Thank you everybody thank you very much, 0, 7
Its great to be with you this afternoon and today we begin a conversation on how to make America safe again, 7, 28
In the twentieth century the United States has defeated fascism Nazism and communism, 28, 41
Now a different threat faces our world: radical Islamic terrorism.n" "This summer theres been an ISIS attack launched outside the warzones of the Middle East--hard to believe--every eighty-four hours, 41, 70
Here in America we have seen one brutal attack after another: thirteen were murdered and thirty-eight wounded in the assault on Fort Hood, 70, 93
The Boston Marathon bombing wounded and maimed sixty-four people and ultimately left five dead including two of our great police officers , 93, 114
In Chattanooga Tennessee five unarmed Marines--unbelievable people by the way--were shot and killed at a military recruiting center.n" "Last September fourteen innocent Americans were gunned down at an office party in San Bernardino; another twenty-two were very gravely injured, 114, 153
In June forty-nine Americans were executed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando , 153, 165
Another fifty-three were badly injured, 165, 170
It was the worst mass shooting in our history and the attack by far the worst on the LGBTQ community and Ill tell you what: we can never ever allow this to happen again, 170, 204
" n In Europe--thank you--in Europe we have seen the same carnage and bloodshed afflicted upon our closest allies, 204, 223
In January of 2015 a French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo was attacked for publishing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed, 223, 242
Twelve were killed including two police officers and 11 were wounded, 242, 253
Two days later four were murdered in a Jewish delicatessen, 253, 263
In November of 2015 terrorist went on a shooting rampage in Paris that slaughtered 130 people and wounded another 368 people some in very very very bad shape today.n France is suffering gravely, 263, 296
And the tourism industry is being massively affected in the most negative way, 296, 309
In March of this year terrorists detonated a bomb in Brussels airport killing 32 and injuring 340 people, 309, 327
This July in the South of France an Islamic terrorist turned his truck into an instrument of mass murder plowing down and killing 85 men women and children and wounding 308 people.n Terrible, 327, 360
Among the dead were two Americans a Texas father and his 11-year-old son, 360, 373
A few weeks ago in Germany a refugee armed with an axe wounded 5 people in a gruesome train attack, 373, 393
Only days ago an ISIS killer invaded a Christian Church in Normandy France forced an 85- year-old priest to his knees, 393, 414
A priest who was beloved who was beloved; before cutting his throat and just unthinkable other things.n "Overseas ISIS has carried out an absolute atrocity and one after another, 414, 443
Children slaughtered girls sold into slavery men and women burned alive crucifixions beheadings and drownings ethnic minorities targeted for mass execution, 443, 464
Holy sites desecrated, 464, 467
Christians driven from their homes and hunted for extermination, 467, 476
ISIS rounding up what it calls Nation of the Cross Nation of the Cross in a campaign of absolute and total genocide.n" We cannot let this evil continue, 476, 504
  Thank you, 504, 506
Thank you.n "Nor can we let the hateful ideology of radical Islam its oppression of women gays children and non-believers be allowed to reside or spread within our own countries, 506, 536
" " We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism just as we have defeated every threat weve faced at every age and before, 536, 558
But we will not we will not remember this defeat it with closed eyes or silenced voices, 558, 575
We have a president that doesnt want to say the words.n" Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead our country, 575, 599
  Anyone who cannot condemn the hatred oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president, 599, 620
 " The rise of ISIS is the direct result of policy decisions made by President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton, 620, 641
Lets look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama-Clinton administration took over.n" Libya was stable, 641, 663
Syria was under control, 663, 667
Egypt was ruled by a secular president and an ally of the United States.n Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence, 667, 688
The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, 688, 703
Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.n Fast forward to today, 703, 715
What we have--and think of this--and the decisions made by the Obama/Clinton group have been absolutely disastrous.n Libya is in ruins, 715, 736
Our ambassador and three other really brave Americans are dead, 736, 746
And ISIS has gained a new base of operations.n Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war, 746, 765
ISIS controls large portions of territory, 765, 771
A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.n In Egypt terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal one of the most essential waterways of the world, 771, 805
Iraq is in chaos, 805, 809
And ISIS is on the loose, 809, 815
ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West.n "In 2014 ISIS was operating in seven nations, 815, 834
They were in seven nations, 834, 839
Terrible but thats what it was.n" "Today theyre fully operational in 18 countries with aspiring branches in six more for a total of 24, 839, 863
And many believe that number is actually 28 to 30 countries, 863, 874
They dont even know.n" "The situation is likely worse than the public has any idea, 874, 889
A new congressional report reveals that the Administration has downplayed the growth of ISIS with 40 percent of analysts saying they had experience efforts to manipulate their findings in trying to make it look much better than it is, 889, 928
Its bad.n" "At the same time ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and to the United States, 928, 948
Iran the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism is not flush with $150 billion in cash released by the United States, 948, 969
Plus if you remember from two weeks ago another $400 million in actual cash that was obviously used for ransom.n" Worst of all the nuclear deal puts Iran the number one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons, 969, 1012
In short the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran which chants "death to America" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring a dominant world power.n "It all began in 2009 with what has become known as President Obamas global apology tour, 1012, 1067
We all remember, 1067, 1070
We all remember, 1070, 1073
Booing In a series of speeches President Obama described America as arrogant dismissive derisive and a colonial power, 1073, 1091
He was describing us.n" "He informed other countries that he would be speaking up about Americas past errors, 1091, 1109
He pledged that we would no longer be a senior partner that sought to dictate our terms, 1109, 1126
He lectured CIA officers of the need to acknowledge their mistakes and described Guantanamo Bay as a rallying cry for our enemies.n" "Perhaps no speech was more misguided than President Obamas speech to the Muslim world delivered in Cairo Egypt 2009, 1126, 1167
I remember it well.n" In winning the Cold War President Ronald Reagan repeatedly touted the superiority of freedom over communism and called the USSR the Evil Empire, 1167, 1194
Yet when President Obama delivered his address in Cairo no such moral courage could be found or would be found, 1194, 1214
Instead of condemning the oppression of women and gays in many Muslim nations and the systematic violations of human rights or the financing of global terrorism President Obama tried to draw an equivalency between our human rights record--and remember this our human rights--and theirs.n The records are unbelievable and unmistakable.n His naive words were followed by even more naive actions, 1214, 1274
The failure to establish a new status of forces agreement in Iraq and the election-driven timetable for withdrawal surrendered our gains in that country and led directly to the rise of ISIS without question, 1274, 1308
 n "The failures in Iraq were compounded by Hillary Clintons disaster total disaster in Libya, 1308, 1323
President Obama has since said that he regrets and really regrets Libya and the mistake he made, 1323, 1340
He considers it his worst mistake, 1340, 1346
According to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates the invasion of Libya was nearly a split decision but Hillary Clintons forceful advocacy for the intervention was the deciding factor, 1346, 1374
Thats why we went in.n" "With one episode of bad judgment after another Hillary Clintons policies launched ISIS onto the world stage, 1374, 1396
Yet as she threw the Middle East into violent turmoil things turned out really to be not so hot for our world and our country, 1396, 1421
The Middle East in particular.n" The Clintons made almost $60000 in gross income while she was secretary of state, 1421, 1440
It is unbelievable, 1440, 1443
Incident after incident proves again and again Hillary Clinton lacks the judgment--as said by Bernie Sanders--stability and temperament and the moral character to lead our nation, 1443, 1469
 n Importantly she also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS and all of the many adversaries we face, 1469, 1491
Not only in terrorism but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around, 1491, 1511
 n It is now time for a new approach, 1511, 1520
Our current strategy of nation- building and regime-change is a proven absolute failure, 1520, 1533
We have created the vacuums that allow terrorism to grow and thrive, 1533, 1545
I was an opponent of the Iraq War from the beginning, 1545, 1556
A major difference between me and my opponent, 1556, 1564
Though I was a private citizen whose personal opinions on such matters were really not sought I nonetheless publicly expressed my private doubts about the invasion, 1564, 1590
I was against believe me.n Three months before the invasion I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto to whom I offer my best wishes for a speedy recovery that "perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet, 1590, 1627
And that the economy is a much bigger problem."n In August of 2004 very early right after the conflict I made a detailed statement to Esquire Magazine in an interview, 1627, 1657
Heres the quote in full, 1657, 1662
"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess were in, 1662, 1673
I would never have handled it that way." This was right after the invasion, 1673, 1687
"Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to go and step up and lead the country? Cmon."n I then continued "Two minutes after we leave theres going to be a revolution and the meanest toughest smartest most viscous guy in this case guy will take over, 1687, 1762
And hell have weapons of mass destruction which Saddam Hussein did not have.n "What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed, 1762, 1790
And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention in all fairness the other side, 1790, 1812
The tremendous damage done, 1812, 1816
All those Iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces, 1816, 1825
And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong, 1825, 1840
All of this death and destruction for nothing."n "So Ive been clear for a long time that we should not have gone in, 1840, 1863
But I have been just as clear in saying what a catastrophic mistake Hillary Clinton and President Obama made with the reckless way in which they pulled out.n" "After we had made those hard fought sacrifices and gains we should have never made such a sudden withdrawal on a timetable advertised to our enemies, 1863, 1917
They said were moving out heres our time heres our date, 1917, 1928
Who would do this but an incompetent president?n" Al Qaeda in Iraq had been decimated, 1928, 1943
And Obama and Clinton gave it new life and allowed it to spread all across the world, 1943, 1960
By that same token President Obama and Hillary Clinton should have never attempted to build a democracy in Libya to push for immediate regime change in Syria or to support the overthrow of Mubarak in Egypt.n One more point on this, 1960, 2001
I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq, 2001, 2014
  I said it over and over and over again, 2014, 2023
Another area where my judgment has been proven correct, 2023, 2032
I just said it so many times virtually every time I was interviewed keep the oil keep the oil.n "According to CNN ISIS made as much as $500000 in oil sales in 2014 alone, 2032, 2066
Thats before they really got started, 2066, 2072
Fueling and funding its reign of terror, 2072, 2079
If we had controlled the oil like I said we should we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S, 2079, 2115
forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil.n" I was saying this constantly and consistently to whomever would listen, 2115, 2143
I said "Keep the oil, 2143, 2148
Keep the oil, 2148, 2151
Keep the oil, 2151, 2154
Dont let somebody else get it."   If they had listened to me then we would have had the economic benefits of the oil which I wanted to use to help take care of the wounded soldiers and families of those who died in the war, 2154, 2199
  In addition to which thousands of lives would have been saved, 2199, 2210
This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets, 2210, 2225
We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil, 2225, 2237
In the old days when we won a war to the victor belonged the spoils, 2237, 2252
 " Instead all we got from Iraq and our ventures in the Middle East was death destruction and tremendous financial loss, 2252, 2273
But its time to put the mistakes of the past behind us and chart a new course, 2273, 2290
" n If I become president the era of nation-building will be brought to a very swift and decisive end, 2290, 2310
 " Thank you, 2310, 2313
Our new approach--which must be shared by both parties in America by our allies overseas and by our friends in the Middle East--must be to halt the spread of radical Islam, 2313, 2344
All actions should be oriented around this goal and any country which shares this goal will be our ally, 2344, 2363
Very important, 2363, 2365
Some dont share this goal, 2365, 2370
We cannot always choose our friends but we can never fail to recognize our enemies, 2370, 2385
" n As president I will call for an international conference focused on this goal, 2385, 2400
We will work side by side with our friends in the Middle East including our greatest ally Israel, 2400, 2418
  We will partner with King Abdullah of Jordan and the president of Egypt President Sisi and all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished, 2418, 2446
 n We will also work very closely with NATO on this new mission, 2446, 2459
I had previously said that NATO was obsolete because it failed to deal adequately with terrorism, 2459, 2475
Since my comments they have changed their policy and now have a new division focused on terror threats, 2475, 2493
Very good, 2493, 2495
Very very good.n "I also believe that we could find common ground with Russia in a fight against ISIS, 2495, 2514
Wouldnt that be a good thing? Wouldnt that be a good thing? "  They too have much at stake in the outcome in Syria and have had their own battles with Islamic terrorism just as bad as ours, 2514, 2552
They have a big big problem in Russia with ISIS.n "My administration will aggressively pursue joint and coalition military operations to crush and destroy ISIS, 2552, 2577
International cooperation to cut off their funding, 2577, 2584
Expanded intelligence sharing and cyber warfare to disrupt and disable their propaganda and recruiting, 2584, 2598
Their recruiting is taking place right now and theyre setting records, 2598, 2609
Its got to be stopped, 2609, 2614
" n We cannot allow the internet to be used as a recruiting tool and for other purposes by our enemy, 2614, 2635
We must shut down their access to this form of communication and we must do it immediately--immediately, 2635, 2652
 n Unlike Hilary Clinton who has risked so many lives with her careless of handling of sensitive information my administration will not telegram exactly military plans and what they are, 2652, 2682
 " And by the way whats happened with her 33000 e-mails is an absolute disgrace to the United States of America, 2682, 2703
" n Ive often said that the great General Douglas MacArthur and the great General George Patton would be in a state of shock if they were alive today to see the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to recklessly announce their every move before it happens, 2703, 2751
Like they did in Iraq so that the enemy can prepare and adapt, 2751, 2764
Their enemy says "Thank you."n The fight will not be limited to ISIS, 2764, 2777
We will decimate Al- Qaeda, 2777, 2782
And we will seek to starve funding for Iran-backed Hamas and Hezbollah, 2782, 2794
  So important, 2794, 2796
We can use existing U.N, 2796, 2801
Security Council resolutions to apply new and even stronger sanctions, 2801, 2811
Military cyber and financial warfare will all be necessary to dismantle Islamic terrorism.n But we must use ideological warfare as well, 2811, 2832
Very important, 2832, 2834
And they use it on us better than we have ever even thought of using it on them, 2834, 2852
But that will change.n Just as we won just as we won the Cold War in part by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets so too must we take on the ideology of radical Islam, 2852, 2892
While my opponent accepted millions of dollars in foundation donations from countries where being gay is an offense punishable by prison or death my administration will speak out against the oppression of women gays and people of different beliefs, 2892, 2931
 n Our administration would be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East and will amplify their voices, 2931, 2952
This includes speaking out against the horrible practice of honor killings where women are murdered by their relatives for dressing marrying or acting in a way that violates fundamentalist teachings, 2952, 2982
Over 1000 Pakistani girls are estimated to be the victims of honor killings by their relatives each year.n Recently a prominent Pakistani social media star was strangled to death by her brother on the charge of dishonoring the family, 2982, 3021
In his confession the brother took pride in the murder and said "Girls are born to stay home and follow traditions." Shockingly this is a tradition that has reached our own shores, 3021, 3053
One such case and many many cases have happened--where one involves an Iraqi immigrant who was sentenced to 34 years in jail for running over his own daughter claiming she had been "too Westernized."n "To defeat Islamic terrorism we must also speak our forcefully against a hateful ideology that provides the breeding ground for violence and terrorism to grow, 3053, 3112
Its a breeding ground, 3112, 3116
Its a terrible terrible breeding ground.n" A new immigration policy is needed immediately and as well, 3116, 3132
  The common thread linking the major Islamic terror attacks that have recently occurred on our soil--9/11 the Fort Hood shooting the Boston bombing the San Bernardino attack the Orlando attack--is that they have involved immigrants or the children of immigrants.n "Clearly new screening procedures are needed, 3132, 3178
A review by the U.S, 3178, 3183
Senate Immigration Subcommittee has identified 380 foreign-born individuals charged with terrorism or terrorism-related offenses between 9/11 and 2014 and many more since then and this year is a record for identification, 3183, 3214
Its gotten worse far worse.n" We also know that ISIS recruits refugees after their entrance into the country as we have seen with the Somali refugee population in Minnesota.n Beyond terrorism as we have also seen in France foreign populations have brought their anti-Semitic attitudes with them, 3214, 3261
In Cologne Germany on New Years we have seen the reports of sexual violence and assault far greater than anybody knows.n "Pew polling shows that in many of the countries from which we draw large number of immigrants--extreme views about religion such death penalty--and for those who are involved--the death penalty is very very common if you dont have the faith that they demand you have.n" A Trump administration will establish a clear principle that will govern all decisions pertaining to immigration and we will be tough and we will be even extreme, 3261, 3354
  We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people, 3354, 3370
In the Cold War we had an ideological screening test, 3370, 3380
The time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today, 3380, 3396
I call it extreme vetting, 3396, 3401
I call it extreme--extreme vetting.n "Our country has enough problems, 3401, 3411
We dont need more and these are problems like weve never had before, 3411, 3424
"  In addition to screening out all members of the sympathizers we must also screen out any with hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law, 3424, 3460
  Those who do not believe in our Constitution or who support bigotry or hatred will not be admitted for immigration into our country, 3460, 3483
  Only those who we expect to flourish in our country and to embrace a tolerant American society should be issued visas, 3483, 3504
  To put these new procedures in place we will have to temporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism nor for us! Not for us, 3504, 3543
 n Thank you, 3543, 3546
Thank you, 3546, 3548
As soon as I take office I will ask the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security to identify a list of regions where adequate screening cannot take place there are many such regions, 3548, 3583
We will stop processing visas from those areas until such time as it is deemed safe to resume based on new circumstances or new procedures, 3583, 3608
The size of current immigration flows are simply too large to perform adequate screening, 3608, 3622
 " We admit about 100000 permanent immigrants from the Middle East every year , 3622, 3635
Beyond that we admit hundreds of thousands of temporary workers and visitors from the same regions--hundreds of thousands , 3635, 3653
If we dont control the numbers we cant perform adequate screening, 3653, 3664
Theres no way it can take place, 3664, 3671
" n "By contrast my opponent wants to increase--which is unbelievable no matter who you are where you come from--wants to increase the flow of Syrian refugees by 550% over what they are now, 3671, 3705
Boos The United States Senate Subcommittee on Immigration estimates that Hillarys plan would mean roughly 620000 refugees from all current refugee-sending nations in her first term  assuming no cuts to other refugee programs--so it could get worse! This would be additional to all other non-refugee immigration, 3705, 3751
Unbelievable numbers, 3751, 3753
Unbelievable numbers, 3753, 3755
The Subcommittee estimates her plan would impose a lifetime cost of roughly $400 billion when you include the cost of healthcare welfare housing schooling and other entitlement benefits that are excluded from the State Departments placement figures, 3755, 3792
Think of this: $400 billion, 3792, 3797
In short Hillary Clinton wants to be Americas Angela Merkel, 3797, 3807
Boos And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany, 3807, 3826
Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever ever see, 3826, 3840
It is a catastrophe, 3840, 3844
We have enough problems in our country, 3844, 3851
We dont need more.n" Lastly we will need to restore common sense to our security procedures, 3851, 3867
Another common feature of the past attacks that have occurred on our soil is that warning signs were totally ignored, 3867, 3887
The 9/11 hijackers had fraud all over their visa applications, 3887, 3897
Almost every one of them, 3897, 3902
It said practically in big bold letters "fraud", 3902, 3910
And nobody saw it, 3910, 3914
The Russians warned us about the Boston bombers here on political asylum and the attackers were even twice interviewed by the FBI, 3914, 3936
Very sad.n "The female San Bernardino shooter on her--on her statements and everything that she said: she was here on a fiancée visa which most people have not even heard of from Saudi Arabia and she wanted to support very openly jihad online, 3936, 3979
These are the people were taking in.n" "A neighbor saw suspicious behavior--bombs on the floor and other things--but didnt warn authorities because they said they didnt want to be accused of racial profiling, 3979, 4012
Now many are dead and many more are gravely wounded.n" "The shooter in Orlando reportedly celebrated in his classroom after 9/11 , 4012, 4033
He too was interviewed by the FBI, 4033, 4040
His father a native of Afghanistan supported the oppressive Taliban regime and expressed anti-American views very strongly  and by the way was just seen sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big fat smile on his face all the way through her speech, 4040, 4082
Boos He obviously liked what she had to say, 4082, 4091
Its called: weakness weakness, 4091, 4095
Its called stupidity and weve had it, 4095, 4102
" n The Fort Hood shooter delivered a presentation to a room full of mental health experts before the attacks in which he threw out one red flag after another, 4102, 4132
He even proclaimed that we "love death more then you love life", 4132, 4144
Not good, 4144, 4146
These warning signs were ignored because political correctness has replaced common sense in our society, 4146, 4161
  Thank you, 4161, 4163
Thank you.n "That is why one of my first acts as president will be to establish a commission on radical Islam which will include reformers voices in the Muslim community who will hopefully work with us, 4163, 4199
We want to build bridges and erase divisions, 4199, 4207
The goal of the commission will be to identify and explain to the American public the core convictions and beliefs of radical Islam to identify the warning signs of radicalization and to expose the networks in our society that support radicalization, 4207, 4248
This commission will be used to develop new protocols for local police officers federal investigators and immigration screeners, 4248, 4266
And while Im at it we should give a hand to our great police officers and law enforcement officials, 4266, 4285
"  Thank you, 4285, 4288
Thank you.n We will also keep open Guantanamo Bay and place a renewed emphasis on human intelligence, 4288, 4305
Drone strikes will remain part of our strategy but we will also seek to capture high-value targets to gain needed information to dismantle their organizations, 4305, 4330
  Foreign combatants will be tried in military commissions, 4330, 4338
 n Finally we will pursue aggressive criminal or immigration charges against anyone who lends materiel support to terrorism, 4338, 4356
There will be consequences for those people, 4356, 4363
There will be very serious consequences, 4363, 4369
  Similar to the effort to take down the mafia this will be the understood mission of every federal investigator and prosecutor in the country, 4369, 4393
 " To accomplish a goal you must state a mission, 4393, 4403
The support networks for radical Islam in this country will be stripped out and removed one-by-one viciously if necessary--viciously if necessary, 4403, 4424
