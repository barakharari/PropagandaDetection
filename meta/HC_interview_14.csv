" Were going to get right to our lead guest former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is in Chappaqua New York this morning." Good morning Secretary Clinton, 0, 28
I want to start with politics, 28, 34
Were going to talk about a lot today but lets start with politics, 34, 47
A new NBC/"Wall Street Journal"/Marist poll says in Iowa its 48-45 you over Sanders, 47, 61
You were once way ahead, 61, 66
So whats happening?  Oh John you know these polls go up they go down, 66, 80
"I stay pretty focused as I think we all should on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration but go even further, 80, 109
And thats why I have outlined a very significant agenda to raise wages and to take on the gun lobby and to be making America safe in every way that I can." And those are some of the differences that I have with my primary opponents and certainly very deep differences with all the Republicans running, 109, 165
 This week another batch of your e-mails were released by the State Department, 165, 178
One of them is a back-and-forth between you and a staffer about a secure fax that wont come through, 178, 197
And you directed him to -- quote -- "turn into non-paper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure." "Arent you ordering him to violate the laws on handling classified material there?"  No not at all, 197, 232
"And as the State Department said just this week that did not happen, 232, 245
And it never would have happened because thats just not the way I treated classified information, 245, 261
Headings are not classification notices, 261, 266
And so oftentimes were trying to get the best information we can." "And obviously what Im asking for is whatever can be transmitted if it doesnt come through secure to be transmitted on the unclassified system, 266, 302
So no there is nothing to that like so much else that has been talked about in the last year."  So in no instance -- what is striking about that particular e-mail is it suggests you were very facile with how to do this this process, 302, 348
You knew the instructions about how to get around the restrictions for sending classified information, 348, 363
"So youre saying there was never an instance any other instance in which you did that?" " No, 363, 381
And it wasnt sent, 381, 385
So I think this is another instance where what is common practice -- namely look I need information, 385, 403
I had some points I had to make, 403, 411
And I was looking for a secure fax that could give me the whole picture." "But oftentimes theres a lot of information that isnt at all classified, 411, 438
So whatever information can appropriately transmitted unclassified often was, 438, 447
Thats true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government." "But the important point here is I had great confidence because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years, 447, 482
He is the most meticulous careful person you could possibly do business with, 482, 495
And he knew exactly what was and wasnt appropriate." "And in fact as the State Department has said there was no transmission of any classified information, 495, 521
So its another effort by people looking for something to throw against the wall as you said in the beginning of the program to see what sticks, 521, 548
But theres no there there."  Well this one is a little different since the FBI is investigating this specific question of whether a classification was meddled with, 548, 575
Let me ask you about another e-mail in this batch which was one in which you seemed to express surprise that somebody e-mailed on their non-State Department personal e-mail which is what you were doing, 575, 610
Why was that a surprise to you?  Well I e-mailed two people on their government accounts because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system, 610, 640
"And indeed the vast majority of all my e-mails are in the government system, 640, 654
So thats how I conducted the business, 654, 661
I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts."  On gun control this week you have been pretty tough on Bernie Sanders specifically on the question of legal protection to gun manufacturers, 661, 702
"He has now said that he would be interested in looking to changing the law to allow -- to go after gun manufacturers who act irresponsibly, 702, 728
So isnt that what you want?" " No thats not what I want, 728, 741
And thats not what the country wants, 741, 748
And thats not what President Obama called for, 748, 756
And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability." "Its the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences, 756, 811
You know President Obama and I and Senator Sanders were all in the Senate at the same time, 811, 829
Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby, 829, 852
Senator Sanders voted with them and through this morning has been unwilling to join the president and me in saying that this should be repealed, 852, 877
That has to be the effort that we all are behind, 877, 888
And he often says well look Im from Vermont and its different, 888, 900
Its not like being in New York City." Well in fact the other senator from Vermont Senator Leahy voted with President Obama and myself, 900, 924
So I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years points up a clear difference, 924, 957
"And its a difference that Democratic voters in our primary can take into account, 957, 971
Who is going to really stand up to the gun lobby try to deal with the scourge of gun violence that takes 90 peoples lives a day? Im pretty clear on what I will do, 971, 1006
And I support and will work hard to implement what the president has been advocating." " On Senator Sanders response this idea that he represents a state which there are lot of gun owners you were a senator, 1006, 1044
You -- arent you sympathetic to that? You said you represented Wall Street and thats what shaped your views on certain Wall Street policy, 1044, 1068
And you have suggested that as president you would be different than you did as senator when you were representing a state with a constituency."  Well.., 1068, 1094
" So why isnt it fair for Bernie Sanders to say as president I would be different than I would as a senator representing a state with a lot of gun owners?"  Well you know I think you have really mixed up two important issues here, 1094, 1140
I have been consistent on gun lobby restrictions, 1140, 1148
In fact I supported the Brady Bill, 1148, 1155
Senator Sanders voted against it five times, 1155, 1162
So there is a very clear difference, 1162, 1169
"And when it comes to Wall Street yes I represented New York, 1169, 1181
And I was proud to do so, 1181, 1188
And I took on Wall Street, 1188, 1194
Im the person who came out against derivatives, 1194, 1202
Im the person who came out calling for restrictions on CEO pay which thankfully got into the Dodd- Frank bill." "Im the person who went to Wall Street and actually confronted them in 2007, 1202, 1236
I called them out on the role they were playing in the mortgage market, 1236, 1250
So I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry including Wall Street." And I will continue to do so as president, 1250, 1283
And the proposal that I have put forth about how we rein in the excesses of Wall Street so we never again face what we did in 2008 has been judged as being more comprehensive tougher more effective by Barney Frank by Sherrod Brown my friend from Ohio who leads the banking efforts in the Senate and by Paul Krugman, 1283, 1343
So I have plan that will go after not just the big banks because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry, 1343, 1378
 Right, 1378, 1379
" And I think Im well-prepared, 1379, 1385
I know what needs to be done, 1385, 1392
Its kind of like Nixon going to China John."  All right Senator let me ask you about a general election opponent you may face, 1392, 1416
That is Donald Trump, 1416, 1420
You got into a pretty ugly exchange, 1420, 1427
You charged that he -- you charged him with sexism and then he put out an Instagram video of your husband and Monica Lewinsky, 1427, 1451
Your reaction to that? " Well if he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past thats his prerogative, 1451, 1471
You know so be it." "Im going to draw the distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women raising the minimum wage which affects two-thirds of the women who are the ones receiving the minimum wage protecting a womans right to make the most personal health care decisions." "Thats why Im so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire because Im going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood something that he supports." "So there are very clear distinctions, 1471, 1577
He can say whatever he wants to about me, 1577, 1586
Let the voters judge that, 1586, 1591
But I am not going to let him or any of the other Republicans rip away the progress that women have made, 1591, 1613
Its been too hard-fought-for, 1613, 1617
And Im going to stand up and make it clear theres a huge difference between us." " Secretary Clinton what do you say though to those even in your own party who say that -- a discussion of that portion of your husbands career is fair game to talk about in an election?" " Well its been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years, 1617, 1684
They can do it again if they want to, 1684, 1693
That can be their choice as to how to run in this campaign, 1693, 1706
Didnt work before, 1706, 1709
It wont work again because it is what people are focused on not for the past but for the future." "What are we going to do to get wages rising? What are we going to do to create more good jobs? What are we going to do keep rights? What are we going to do to make sure that the Supreme Court has people on it who will defend womens rights who will defend marriage equality who will defend voter rights?" "So I cant run anybody elses campaign, 1709, 1797
They can say whatever they want, 1797, 1803
More power to them, 1803, 1807
I think its a dead end blind alley for them but let them go, 1807, 1821
Im going to talk about the differences between us because I think thats what Americans care about, 1821, 1838
" " Secretary Clinton Im afraid were at a dead end ourselves and out of time, 1838, 1854
"   Thanks so much for being with us, 1854, 1862
" Thanks, 1862, 1864
Lets continue the conversation John."  See you out there, 1864, 1873
