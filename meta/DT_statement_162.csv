Trump issued the following statement today on the National Enquirer Story: "I have no idea whether or not the cover story about Ted Cruz in this weeks issue of the National Enquirer is true or not but I had absolutely nothing to do with it did not know about it and have not as yet read it, 2, 59
Likewise I have nothing to do with the National Enquirer and unlike Lyin Ted Cruz I do not surround myself with political hacks and henchmen and then pretend total innocence, 59, 89
Ted Cruzs problem with the National Enquirer is his and his alone and while they were right about O.J, 89, 108
Simpson John Edwards and many others I certainly hope they are not right about Lyin Ted Cruz, 108, 125
I look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin winning the Republican nomination and ultimately the Presidency in order to Make America Great Again." , 125, 149
