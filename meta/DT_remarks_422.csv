"Wow, 0, 1
Thank you, 1, 3
Thats a lot of people Phoenix thats a lot of people.n" Thank you very much.n Thank you Phoenix, 3, 21
I am so glad to be back in Arizona.n The state that has a very very special place in my heart, 21, 42
I love people of Arizona and together we are going to win the White House in November.n "Now you know this is where it all began for me, 42, 70
Remember that massive crowd also, 70, 75
So I said lets go and have some fun tonight, 75, 85
Were going to Arizona OK?n" "This will be a little bit different, 85, 97
This wont be a rally speech per se, 97, 105
Instead Im going to deliver a detailed policy address on one of the greatest challenges facing our country today illegal immigration.n" "Ive just landed having returned from a very important and special meeting with the President of Mexico a man I like and respect very much, 105, 151
And a man who truly loves his country Mexico.n" And by the way just like I am a man who loves my country the United States.n We agree on the importance of ending the illegal flow of drugs cash guns and people across our border and to put the cartels out of business.n "We also discussed the great contributions of Mexican-American citizens to our two countries my love for the people of Mexico and the leadership and friendship between Mexico and the United States, 151, 235
It was a thoughtful and substantive conversation and it will go on for awhile, 235, 249
And in the end were all going to win, 249, 258
Both countries were all going to win.n" "This is the first of what I expect will be many many conversations, 258, 278
And in a Trump administration were going to go about creating a new relationship between our two countries but its going to be a fair relationship, 278, 304
We want fairness.n" But to fix our immigration system we must change our leadership in Washington and we must change it quickly.n "Sadly sadly there is no other way, 304, 333
The truth is our immigration system is worse than anybody ever realized, 333, 345
But the facts arent known because the media wont report on them, 345, 357
The politicians wont talk about them and the special interests spend a lot of money trying to cover them up because they are making an absolute fortune, 357, 384
Thats the way it is.n" "Today on a very complicated and very difficult subject you will get the truth, 384, 403
The fundamental problem with the immigration system in our country is that it serves the needs of wealthy donors political activists and powerful powerful politicians, 403, 428
Its all you can do, 428, 433
Thank you, 433, 435
Thank you.n" "Let me tell you who it does not serve, 435, 446
It does not serve you the American people, 446, 454
Doesnt serve you, 454, 457
When politicians talk about immigration reform they usually mean the following amnesty open borders lower wages, 457, 473
Immigration reform should mean something else entirely, 473, 480
It should mean improvements to our laws and policies to make life better for American citizens.n" "Thank you, 480, 498
But if were going to make our immigration system work then we have to be prepared to talk honestly and without fear about these important and very sensitive issues, 498, 527
For instance we have to listen to the concerns that working people our forgotten working people have over the record pace of immigration and its impact on their jobs wages housing schools tax bills and general living conditions.n" "These are valid concerns expressed by decent and patriotic citizens from all backgrounds all over, 527, 580
We also have to be honest about the fact that not everyone who seeks to join our country will be able to successfully assimilate, 580, 604
Sometimes its just not going to work out, 604, 612
Its our right as a sovereign nation to chose immigrants that we think are the likeliest to thrive and flourish and love us.n" Then there is the issue of security, 612, 642
Countless innocent American lives have been stolen because our politicians have failed in their duty to secure our borders and enforce our laws like they have to be enforced, 642, 671
I have met with many of the great parents who lost their children to sanctuary cities and open borders, 671, 690
So many people so many many people, 690, 697
So sad, 697, 699
They will be joining me on this stage in a little while and I look forward to introducing these are amazing amazing people.n Countless Americans who have died in recent years would be alive today if not for the open border policies of this administration and the administration that causes this horrible horrible thought process called Hillary Clinton.n This includes incredible Americans like 21 year old Sarah Root, 699, 767
The man who killed her arrived at the border entered Federal custody and then was released into the U.S, 767, 786
think of it into the U.S, 786, 792
community under the policies of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, 792, 805
Weak weak policies, 805, 808
Weak and foolish policies.n "He was released again after the crime and now hes out there at large, 808, 826
Sarah had graduated from college with a 4.0 top student in her class one day before her death.n" Also among the victims of the Obama-Clinton open borders policy was Grant Ronnebeck a 21-year-old convenience store clerk and a really good guy from Mesa Arizona, 826, 870
A lot of you have known about Grant.n He was murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member previously convicted of burglary who had also been released from federal custody and they knew it was going to happen again.n Another victim is Kate Steinle, 870, 913
Gunned down in the sanctuary city of San Francisco by an illegal immigrant deported five previous times, 913, 930
And they knew he was no good.n Then there is the case of 90-year-old Earl Olander who was brutally beaten and left to bleed to death in his home 90 years old and defenseless, 930, 964
The perpetrators were illegal immigrants with criminal records a mile long who did not meet Obama administration standards for removal, 964, 984
And they knew it was going to happen.n In California a 64-year-old Air Force veteran a great woman according to everybody that knew her Marilyn Pharis was sexually assaulted and beaten to death with a hammer, 984, 1020
Her killer had been arrested on multiple occasions but was never ever deported despite the fact that everybody wanted him out.n A 2011 report from the Government Accountability Office found that illegal immigrants and other non-citizens in our prisons and jails together had around 25000 homicide arrests to their names 25000.n On top of that illegal immigration costs our country more than $113 billion dollars a year.n And this is what we get, 1020, 1093
For the money we are going to spend on illegal immigration over the next 10 years we could provide 1 million at-risk students with a school voucher which so many people are wanting.n "While there are many illegal immigrants in our country who are good people many many this doesnt change the fact that most illegal immigrants are lower skilled workers with less education who compete directly against vulnerable American workers and that these illegal workers draw much more out from the system than they can ever possibly pay back.n" "And theyre hurting a lot of our people that cannot get jobs under any circumstances.n" "But these facts are never reported, 1093, 1204
Instead the media and my opponent discuss one thing and only one thing the needs of people living here illegally, 1204, 1224
In many cases by the way theyre treated better than our vets.n" Not going to happen anymore folks, 1224, 1242
November 8th, 1242, 1244
Not going to happen anymore.n "The truth is the central issue is not the needs of the 11 million illegal immigrants or however many there may be -- and honestly weve been hearing that number for years, 1244, 1281
Its always 11 million.n" Our government has no idea, 1281, 1290
It could be 3 million, 1290, 1295
It could be 30 million, 1295, 1300
They have no idea what the number is.n "Frankly our government has no idea what theyre doing on many many fronts folks.n" "But whatever the number thats never really been the central issue, 1300, 1333
It will never be a central issue, 1333, 1340
It doesnt matter from that standpoint, 1340, 1346
Anyone who tells you that the core issue is the needs of those living here illegally has simply spent too much time in Washington.n" "Only the out of touch media elites think the biggest problems facing America -- you know this this is what they talk about facing American society today is that there are 11 million illegal immigrants who dont have legal status, 1346, 1410
And they also think the biggest thing and you know this its not nuclear and its not ISIS its not Russia its not China its global warming.n" To all the politicians donors and special interests hear these words from me and all of you today, 1410, 1455
There is only one core issue in the immigration debate and that issue is the well being of the American people.n "Nothing even comes a close second, 1455, 1482
Hillary Clinton for instance talks constantly about her fears that families will be separated but shes not talking about the American families who have been permanently separated from their loved ones because of a preventable homicide because of a preventable death because of murder.n" "No shes only talking about families who come here in violation of the law, 1482, 1540
We will treat everyone living or residing in our country with great dignity, 1540, 1553
So important.n" We will be fair just and compassionate to all but our greatest compassion must be for our American citizens.n Thank you.n President Obama and Hillary Clinton have engaged in gross dereliction of duty by surrendering the safety of the American people to open borders and you know it better than anybody right here in Arizona, 1553, 1610
You know it.n President Obama and Hillary Clinton support sanctuary cities, 1610, 1621
They support catch and release on the border, 1621, 1629
they support visa overstays, 1629, 1633
They support the release of dangerous dangerous dangerous criminals from detention, 1633, 1644
And they support unconstitutional executive amnesty.n Hillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and her plan will provide Obamacare Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants breaking the federal budget.n On top of that she promises uncontrolled low-skilled immigration that continues to reduce jobs and wages for American workers and especially for African-American and Hispanic workers within our country, 1644, 1706
Our citizens.n "Most incredibly because to me this is unbelievable we have no idea who these people are where they come from, 1706, 1728
I always say Trojan Horse, 1728, 1733
Watch whats going to happen folks, 1733, 1739
Its not going to be pretty.n" This includes her plan to bring in 620000 new refugees from Syria and that region over a short period of time, 1739, 1766
And even yesterday when you were watching the news you saw thousands and thousands of people coming in from Syria, 1766, 1786
What is wrong with our politicians our leaders if we can call them that, 1786, 1800
What the hell are we doing?n "Hard to believe, 1800, 1809
Hard to believe, 1809, 1812
Now that youve heard about Hillary Clintons plan about which she has not answered a single question let me tell you about my plan.And do you notice --n" "And do you notice all the time for weeks and weeks of debating my plan debating talking about it what about this what about that, 1812, 1865
They never even mentioned her plan on immigration because she doesnt want to get into the quagmire, 1865, 1882
Its a tough one she doesnt know what shes doing except open borders and let everybody come in and destroy our country by the way.n" While Hillary Clinton meets only with donors and lobbyists my plan was crafted with the input from Federal Immigration offices very great people, 1882, 1930
Among the top immigration experts anywhere in this country who represent workers not corporations very important to us.n "I also worked with lawmakers whove led on this issue on behalf of American citizens for many years, 1930, 1966
And most importantly Ive met with the people directly impacted by these policies, 1966, 1979
So important.n" Number one are you ready? Are you ready?n We will build a great wall along the southern border.n And Mexico will pay for the wall.n "One hundred percent, 1979, 2009
They dont know it yet but theyre going to pay for it, 2009, 2021
And theyre great people and great leaders but theyre going to pay for the wall, 2021, 2036
On day one we will begin working on intangible physical tall power beautiful southern border wall.n" "We will use the best technology including above and below ground sensors thats the tunnels, 2036, 2067
Remember that above and below.n" "Above and below ground sensors, 2067, 2077
Towers aerial surveillance and manpower to supplement the wall find and dislocate tunnels and keep out criminal cartels and Mexico you know that will work with us, 2077, 2104
I really believe it, 2104, 2108
Mexico will work with us, 2108, 2113
I absolutely believe it, 2113, 2117
And especially after meeting with their wonderful wonderful president today, 2117, 2127
I really believe they want to solve this problem along with us and Im sure they will.n" Number two we are going to end catch and release, 2127, 2154
We catch them oh go ahead, 2154, 2160
We catch them go ahead.n Under my administration anyone who illegally crosses the border will be detained until they are removed out of our country and back to the country from which they came.n "And theyll be brought great distances, 2160, 2200
Were not dropping them right across, 2200, 2206
They learned that, 2206, 2209
President Eisenhower, 2209, 2211
Theyd drop them across right across and theyd come back, 2211, 2221
And across.n" Then when they flew them to a long distance all of a sudden that was the end, 2221, 2240
We will take them great distances, 2240, 2246
But we will take them to the country where they came from OK?n "Number three, 2246, 2261
Number three this is the one I think its so great, 2261, 2272
Its hard to believe people dont even talk about it, 2272, 2282
Zero tolerance for criminal aliens, 2282, 2287
Zero, 2287, 2288
Zero.n" "Zero, 2288, 2290
They dont come in here, 2290, 2295
They dont come in here.n" According to federal data there are at least 2 million 2 million think of it criminal aliens now inside of our country 2 million people criminal aliens, 2295, 2327
We will begin moving them out day one, 2327, 2335
As soon as I take office, 2335, 2341
Day one, 2341, 2343
In joint operation with local state and federal law enforcement.n "Now just so you understand the police who we all respect -- say hello to the police, 2343, 2370
Boy they dont get the credit they deserve, 2370, 2378
I can tell you, 2378, 2382
Theyre great people, 2382, 2385
But the police and law enforcement they know who these people are.n" "They live with these people, 2385, 2402
They get mocked by these people, 2402, 2408
They cant do anything about these people and they want to, 2408, 2419
They know who these people are, 2419, 2425
Day one my first hour in office those people are gone.n" "And you can call it deported if you want, 2425, 2445
The press doesnt like that term, 2445, 2451
You can call it whatever the hell you want, 2451, 2460
Theyre gone.n" "Beyond the 2 million and there are vast numbers of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled but their days have run out in this country, 2460, 2488
The crime will stop, 2488, 2492
Theyre going to be gone, 2492, 2497
It will be over.n" "Theyre going out, 2497, 2504
Theyre going out fast.n" Moving forward, 2504, 2510
We will issue detainers for illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings if we even have to do that.n "We will terminate the Obama administrations deadly and it is deadly non-enforcement policies that allow thousands of criminal aliens to freely roam our streets walk around do whatever they want to do crime all over the place.n" "Thats over, 2510, 2579
Thats over folks, 2579, 2582
Thats over.n" "Since 2013 alone the Obama administration has allowed 300000 criminal aliens to return back into United States communities, 2582, 2602
These are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation because it wouldnt have been politically correct.n" "My plan also includes cooperating closely with local jurisdictions to remove criminal aliens immediately, 2602, 2640
We will restore the highly successful Secure Communities Program, 2640, 2649
Good program, 2649, 2651
We will expand and revitalize the popular 287(g) partnerships which will help to identify hundreds of thousands of deportable aliens in local jails that we dont even know about.n" Both of these programs have been recklessly gutted by this administration, 2651, 2691
And those were programs that worked.n "This is yet one more area where we are headed in a totally opposite direction, 2691, 2712
Theres no common sense theres no brain power in our administration by our leader or our leaders, 2712, 2729
None none none.n" "Heres an interesting graphic from a study published this summer on voting attitudes among people who heard incumbents use restrictive rhetoric on immigration -- tough enforcement no amnesty deportations -- and its affect on their own opinions.n" "On my first day in office I am also going to ask Congress to pass Kates Law named for Kate Steinle.n" To ensure that criminal aliens convicted of illegal reentry receive strong mandatory minimum sentences, 2729, 2804
Strong.n And then we get them out.n "Another reform Im proposing is the passage of legislation named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver to law enforcement officers recently killed by a previously deported illegal immigrant.n" "The Davis-Oliver bill will enhance cooperation with state and local authorities to ensure that criminal immigrants and terrorists are swiftly really swiftly identified and removed, 2804, 2867
And they will go face believe me, 2867, 2874
Theyre going to go.n" "Were going to triple the number of ICE deportation officers.n" Within ICE I am going to create a new special deportation task force focused on identifying and quickly removing the most dangerous criminal illegal immigrants in America who have evaded justice just like Hillary Clinton has evaded justice OK?n "Maybe theyll be able to deport her.n" "The local police who know every one of these criminals and they know each and every one by name by crime where they live they will work so fast, 2874, 2963
And our local police will be so happy that they dont have to be abused by these thugs anymore, 2963, 2982
Theres no great mystery to it theyve put up with it for years and no finally we will turn the tables and law enforcement and our police will be allowed to clear up this dangerous and threatening mess.n" "Were also going to hire 5000 more Border Patrol agents.n" Who gave me their endorsement 16500 gave me their endorsement.n And put more of them on the border instead of behind desks which is good, 2982, 3055
We will expand the number of border patrol stations significantly.n "Ive had a chance to spend time with these incredible law enforcement officers and I want to take a moment to thank them, 3055, 3088
What they do is incredible.n" "And getting their endorsement means so much to me, 3088, 3102
More to me really than I can say, 3102, 3110
Means so much, 3110, 3113
First time theyve ever endorsed a presidential candidate.n" Number four block funding for sanctuary cities, 3113, 3128
We block the funding, 3128, 3132
No more funds.n We will end the sanctuary cities that have resulted in so many needless deaths, 3132, 3149
Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities will not receive taxpayer dollars and we will work with Congress to pass legislation to protect those jurisdictions that do assist federal authorities.n Number five cancel unconstitutional executive orders and enforce all immigration laws.n "We will immediately terminate President Obamas two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants five million.n" And how about all the millions that are waiting on line going through the process legally? So unfair.n Hillary Clinton has pledged to keep both of these illegal amnesty programs including the 2014 amnesty which has been blocked by the United States Supreme Court, 3149, 3265
Great.n Clinton has also pledged to add a third executive amnesty, 3265, 3276
And by the way folks she will be a disaster for our country a disaster in so many other ways.n "And dont forget the Supreme Court of the United States, 3276, 3306
Dont forget that when you go to vote on November 8, 3306, 3317
And dont forget your Second Amendment, 3317, 3323
And dont forget the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.n" "And dont forget building up our depleted military, 3323, 3340
And dont forget taking care of our vets, 3340, 3348
Dont forget our vets, 3348, 3352
They have been forgotten.n" "Clintons plan would trigger a constitutional crisis unlike almost anything we have ever seen before, 3352, 3371
In effect she would be abolishing the lawmaking powers of Congress in order to write her own laws from the Oval Office, 3371, 3393
And you see what bad judgment she has, 3393, 3401
She has seriously bad judgment.n" Can you imagine? In a Trump administration all immigration laws will be enforced will be enforced, 3401, 3422
As with any law enforcement activity we will set priorities, 3422, 3432
But unlike this administration no one will be immune or exempt from enforcement, 3432, 3445
And ICE and Border Patrol officers will be allowed to do their jobs the way their jobs are supposed to be done.n "Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation, 3445, 3479
That is what it means to have laws and to have a country, 3479, 3492
Otherwise we dont have a country.n" "Our enforcement priorities will include removing criminals gang members security threats visa overstays public charges, 3492, 3513
That is those relying on public welfare or straining the safety net along with millions of recent illegal arrivals and overstays whove come here under this current corrupt administration.n" Number six we are going to suspend the issuance of visas to any place where adequate screening cannot occur.n "According to data provided by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the national interest between 9/11 and the end of 2014 at least 380 foreign born individuals were convicted in terror cases inside the United States, 3513, 3597
And even right now the largest number of people are under investigation for exactly this that weve ever had in the history of our country.n" "Our country is a mess, 3597, 3627
We dont even know what to look for anymore folks, 3627, 3637
Our country has to straighten out, 3637, 3643
And we have to straighten out fast.n" The number is likely higher, 3643, 3655
But the administration refuses to provide this information even to Congress, 3655, 3666
As soon as I enter office I am going to ask the Department of State which has been brutalized by Hillary Clinton brutalized.n Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to begin a comprehensive review of these cases in order to develop a list of regions and countries from which immigration must be suspended until proven and effective vetting mechanisms can be put in place.n "I call it extreme vetting right? Extreme vetting, 3666, 3739
I want extreme, 3739, 3742
Its going to be so tough and if somebody comes in thats fine but theyre going to be good, 3742, 3761
Its extreme.n" "And if people dont like it weve got have a country folks, 3761, 3775
Got to have a country, 3775, 3780
Countries in which immigration will be suspended would include places like Syria and Libya, 3780, 3794
And we are going to stop the tens of thousands of people coming in from Syria.We have no idea who they are where they come from, 3794, 3820
Theres no documentation, 3820, 3823
Theres no paperwork, 3823, 3826
Its going to end badly folks, 3826, 3832
Its going to end very very badly.n" "For the price of resettling one refugee in the United States 12 could be resettled in a safe zone in their home region, 3832, 3862
Which I agree with 100 percent, 3862, 3868
We have to build safe zones and well get the money from Gulf states, 3868, 3882
We dont want to put up the money, 3882, 3890
We owe almost $20 trillion, 3890, 3895
Doubled since Obama took office our national debt.n" "But we will get the money from Gulf states and others, 3895, 3914
Well supervise it, 3914, 3917
Well build safe zones which is something that I think all of us want to see.n" Another reform involves new screening tests for all applicants that include and this is so important especially if you get the right people, 3917, 3956
And we will get the right people, 3956, 3963
An ideological certification to make sure that those we are admitting to our country share our values and love our people.n "Thank you, 3963, 3986
Were very proud of our country, 3986, 3992
Arent we? Really? With all its going through were very proud of our country, 3992, 4006
For instance in the last five years weve admitted nearly 100000 immigrants from Iraq and Afghanistan, 4006, 4022
And these two countries according to Pew Research a majority of residents say that the barbaric practice of honor killings against women are often or sometimes justified, 4022, 4049
Thats what they say.n" "Thats what they say, 4049, 4057
Theyre justified, 4057, 4059
Right? And were admitting them to our country, 4059, 4067
Applicants will be asked their views about honor killings about respect for women and gays and minorities, 4067, 4084
Attitudes on radical Islam which our President refuses to say and many other topics as part of this vetting procedure, 4084, 4104
And if we have the right people doing it believe me very very few will slip through the cracks, 4104, 4123
Hopefully none.n" Number seven we will insure that other countries take their people back when they order them deported.n "There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after theyve been ordered to leave the United States, 4123, 4164
Including large numbers of violent criminals they wont take them back, 4164, 4175
So we say OK well keep them, 4175, 4182
Not going to happen with me not going to happen with me.n" Due to a Supreme Court decision if these violent offenders cannot be sent home our law enforcement officers have to release them into your communities.n "And by the way the results are horrific horrific, 4182, 4228
There are often terrible consequences such as Casey Chadwicks tragic death in Connecticut just last year, 4228, 4244
Yet despite the existence of a law that commands the Secretary of State to stop issuing visas to these countries.n" Secretary Hillary Clinton ignored this law and refused to use this powerful tool to bring nations into compliance, 4244, 4282
And they would comply if we would act properly.n "In other words if we had leaders that knew what they were doing which we dont.n" The result of her misconduct was the release of thousands and thousands of dangerous criminal aliens who should have been sent home to their countries, 4282, 4332
Instead we have them all over the place, 4332, 4340
Probably a couple in this room as a matter of fact but I hope not.n According to a report for the Boston Globe from the year 2008 to 2014 nearly 13000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S, 4340, 4378
communities because their home countries would not under any circumstances take them back, 4378, 4391
Hard to believe with the power we have, 4391, 4399
Hard to believe.n "Were like the big bully that keeps getting beat up, 4399, 4412
You ever see that? The big bully that keeps getting beat up.n" "These 13000 release occurred on Hillary Clintons watch, 4412, 4432
She had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she decided she would not do it.n" "And Arizona knows better than most exactly what Im talking about.n" (APPLAUSE)n Those released include individuals convicted of killings sexual assaults and some of the most heinous crimes imaginable.n The Boston Globe writes that a Globe review of 323 criminals released in New England from 2008 to 2012 found that as many as 30 percent committed new offenses including rape attempted murder and child molestation, 4432, 4516
We take them we take them.n Number eight we will finally complete the biometric entry-exit visa tracking system which we need desperately, 4516, 4538
For years Congress has required biometric entry-exit visa tracking systems but it has never been completed, 4538, 4554
The politicians are all talk no action never happens, 4554, 4563
Never happens.n "Hillary Clinton all talk, 4563, 4569
Unfortunately when there is action its always the wrong decision, 4569, 4579
You ever notice? In my administration we will ensure that this system is in place, 4579, 4594
And I will tell you it will be on land it will be on sea it will be in air, 4594, 4614
We will have a proper tracking system.n" "Approximately half of new illegal immigrants came on temporary visas and then never ever left, 4614, 4636
Why should the? Nobodys telling them to leave, 4636, 4644
Stay as long as you want well take care of you.n" Beyond violating our laws visa overstays pose -- and they really are a big problem pose a substantial threat to national security, 4644, 4677
The 9/11 Commission said that this tracking system would be a high priority and would have assisted law enforcement and intelligence officials in august and September in 2001 in conducting a search for two of the 9/11 hijackers that were in the United States expired visas.n "And you know what that would have meant what that could have meant, 4677, 4736
Wouldnt that have been wonderful right? What that could have meant?n" Last year alone nearly half a million individuals overstayed their temporary visas, 4736, 4759
Removing these overstays will be a top priority of my administration.n "If people around the world believe they can just come on a temporary visa and never ever leave the Obama-Clinton policy thats what it is then we have a completely open border and we no longer have a country.n" We must send a message that visa expiration dates will be strongly enforced.n Number nine we will turn off the jobs and benefits magnet.n We will ensure that E-Verify is used to the fullest extent possible under existing law and we will work with Congress to strengthen and expand its use across the country.n "Immigration law doesnt exist for the purpose of keeping criminals out, 4759, 4874
It exists to protect all aspects of American life, 4874, 4883
The work site the welfare office the education system and everything else.n" That is why immigration limits are established in the first place, 4883, 4906
If we only enforced the laws against crime then we have an open border to the entire world, 4906, 4924
We will enforce all of our immigration laws.n And the same goes for government benefits, 4924, 4939
The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that 62 percent of households headed by illegal immigrants use some form of cash or non-cash welfare programs like food stamps or housing assistance.n Tremendous costs by the way to our country, 4939, 4977
Tremendous costs, 4977, 4979
This directly violates the federal public charge law designed to protect the United States Treasury, 4979, 4994
Those who abuse our welfare system will be priorities for immediate removal.n "Number 10 we will reform legal immigration to serve the best interests of America and its workers the forgotten people, 4994, 5026
Workers, 5026, 5027
Were going to take care of our workers.n" "And by the way and by the way were going to make great trade deals, 5027, 5050
Were going to renegotiate trade deals, 5050, 5056
Were going to bring our jobs back home, 5056, 5064
Were going to bring our jobs back home.n" We have the most incompetently worked trade deals ever negotiated probably in the history of the world and that starts with NAFTA, 5064, 5094
And now they want to go TPP one of the great disasters.n "Were going to bring our jobs back home, 5094, 5114
And if companies want to leave Arizona and if they want to leave other states theres going to be a lot of trouble for them, 5114, 5139
Its not going to be so easy, 5139, 5146
There will be consequence, 5146, 5150
Remember that, 5150, 5152
There will be consequence, 5152, 5156
Theyre not going to be leaving go to another country make the product sell it into the United States and all we end up with is no taxes and total unemployment, 5156, 5187
Its not going to happen, 5187, 5192
There will be consequences.n" "Weve admitted 59 million immigrants to the United States between 1965 and 2015, 5192, 5209
Many of these arrivals have greatly enriched our country, 5209, 5218
So true, 5218, 5220
But we now have an obligation to them and to their children to control future immigration as we are following if you think previous immigration waves.n" "Weve had some big waves, 5220, 5251
And tremendously positive things have happened, 5251, 5257
Incredible things have happened, 5257, 5261
To ensure assimilation we want to ensure that it works, 5261, 5271
Assimilation an important word, 5271, 5275
Integration and upward mobility.n" Within just a few years immigration as a share of national population is set to break all historical records, 5275, 5298
The time has come for a new immigration commission to develop a new set of reforms to our legal immigration system in order to achieve the following goals.n To keep immigration levels measured by population share within historical norms, 5298, 5337
To select immigrants based on their likelihood of success in U.S, 5337, 5348
society and their ability to be financially self- sufficient.n We take anybody, 5348, 5360
Come on in anybody, 5360, 5364
Just come on in, 5364, 5368
Not anymore.n "You know folks its called a two-way street, 5368, 5378
It is a two-way street right? We need a system that serves our needs not the needs of others, 5378, 5397
Remember under a Trump administration its called America first, 5397, 5406
Remember that.n" "To choose immigrants based on merit, 5406, 5414
Merit skill and proficiency, 5414, 5418
Doesnt that sound nice? And to establish new immigration controls to boost wages and to ensure that open jobs are offered to American workers first, 5418, 5443
And that in particular African- American and Latino workers who are being shut out in this process so unfairly.n" "And Hillary Clinton is going to do nothing for the African- American worker the Latino worker, 5443, 5478
Shes going to do nothing, 5478, 5483
Give me your vote she says on November eighth, 5483, 5492
And then shell say so long see you in four years, 5492, 5503
Thats what it is.n" "She is going to do nothing, 5503, 5513
And just look at the past, 5513, 5519
Shes done nothing, 5519, 5522
Shes been there for 35 years, 5522, 5528
Shes done nothing, 5528, 5531
And I say what do you have to lose? Choose me, 5531, 5542
Watch how good were going to do together, 5542, 5550
Watch.n" "You watch, 5550, 5553
We want people to come into our country but they have to come into our country legally and properly vetted and in a manner that serves the national interest, 5553, 5582
Weve been living under outdated immigration rules from decades ago, 5582, 5592
Theyre decades and decades old.n" "To avoid this happening in the future I believe we should sunset our visa laws so that Congress is forced to periodically revise and revisit them to bring them up to date, 5592, 5629
Theyre archaic, 5629, 5631
Theyre ancient, 5631, 5633
We wouldnt put our entire federal budget on auto pilot for decades so why should we do the same for the very very complex subject of immigration?n" "So lets now talk about the big picture, 5633, 5668
These 10 steps if rigorously followed and enforced will accomplish more in a matter of months than our politicians have accomplished on this issue in the last 50 years, 5668, 5697
Its going to happen folks, 5697, 5702
Because I am proudly not a politician because I am not behold to any special interest Ive spent a lot of money on my campaign Ill tell you, 5702, 5730
I write those checks, 5730, 5734
Nobody owns Trump.n" "I will get this done for you and for your family, 5734, 5748
Well do it right, 5748, 5752
Youll be proud of our country again, 5752, 5759
Well do it right, 5759, 5763
We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, 5763, 5772
And when we do peace and law and justice and prosperity will prevail, 5772, 5785
Crime will go down, 5785, 5789
Border crossings will plummet, 5789, 5793
Gangs will disappear.n" "And the gangs are all over the place, 5793, 5804
And welfare use will decrease, 5804, 5809
We will have a peace dividend to spend on rebuilding America beginning with our American inner cities, 5809, 5826
Were going to rebuild them for once and for all.n" For those here illegally today who are seeking legal status they will have one route and one route only, 5826, 5855
To return home and apply for reentry like everybody else under the rules of the new legal immigration system that I have outlined above, 5855, 5879
Those who have left to seek entry --n Thank you, 5879, 5889
Thank you, 5889, 5891
Those who have left to seek entry under this new system -- and it will be an efficient system -- will not be awarded surplus visas but will have to apply for entry under the immigration caps or limits that will be established in the future.n We will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration, 5891, 5947
We will break the cycle, 5947, 5952
There will be no amnesty.n "Our message to the world will be this, 5952, 5965
You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country, 5965, 5983
Cant do it.n" "This declaration alone will help stop the crisis of illegal crossings and illegal overstays very importantly, 5983, 6002
People will know that you cant just smuggle in hunker down and wait to be legalized, 6002, 6018
Its not going to work that way, 6018, 6025
Those days are over.n" Importantly in several years when we have accomplished all of our enforcement and deportation goals and truly ended illegal immigration for good including the construction of a great wall which we will have built in record time, 6025, 6066
And at a reasonable cost which you never hear from the government.n And the establishment of our new lawful immigration system then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain.n That discussion can take place only in an atmosphere in which illegal immigration is a memory of the past no longer with us allowing us to weigh the different options available based on the new circumstances at the time.n "Right now however were in the middle of a jobs crisis a border crisis and a terrorism crisis like never before, 6066, 6167
All energies of the federal government and the legislative process must now be focused on immigration security, 6167, 6184
That is the only conversation we should be having at this time immigration security, 6184, 6198
Cut it off.n" "Whether its dangerous materials being smuggled across the border terrorists entering on visas or Americans losing their jobs to foreign workers these are the problems we must now focus on fixing, 6198, 6232
And the media needs to begin demanding to hear Hillary Clintons answer on how her policies will affect Americans and their security.n" "These are matters of life and death for our country and its people and we deserve answers from Hillary Clinton, 6232, 6274
And do you notice she doesnt answer.n" "She didnt go to Louisiana, 6274, 6286
She didnt go to Mexico, 6286, 6291
She was invited.n" "She doesnt have the strength or the stamina to make America great again, 6291, 6307
Believe me.n" "What we do know despite the lack of media curiosity is that Hillary Clinton promises a radical amnesty combined with a radical reduction in immigration enforcement, 6307, 6335
Just ask the Border Patrol about Hillary Clinton, 6335, 6343
You wont like what youre hearing.n" "The result will be millions more illegal immigrants; thousands of more violent horrible crimes; and total chaos and lawlessness, 6343, 6368
Thats whats going to happen as sure as youre standing there.n" This election and I believe this is our last chance to secure the border stop illegal immigration and reform our laws to make your life better, 6368, 6405
I really believe this is it, 6405, 6411
This is our last time, 6411, 6416
November 8, 6416, 6418
November 8, 6418, 6420
You got to get out and vote on November 8.n "Its our last chance, 6420, 6434
Its our last chance, 6434, 6438
And that includes Supreme Court justices and Second Amendment, 6438, 6447
Remember that.n" "So I want to remind everyone what were fighting for and who we are fighting for.n" "I am going to ask -- these are really special people that Ive gotten to know, 6447, 6481
Im going to ask all the Angel Moms to come join me on the stage right now, 6481, 6498

I just think Ive gotten to know so many of them and many more from our group, 6527, 6544
But they are incredible people and what theyre going through is incredible and theres just no reason for it, 6544, 6563
Lets give them a really tremendous hand.n" "Thats tough stuff I will tell you, 6563, 6577
That is tough stuff, 6577, 6581
Incredible people.n" So now is the time for these voices to be heard, 6581, 6594
Now is the time for the media to begin asking questions on their behalf, 6594, 6608
Now is the time for all of us as one country Democrat Republican liberal conservative to band together to deliver justice and safety and security for all Americans.n "Lets fix this horrible horrible problem, 6608, 6642
It can be fixed quickly, 6642, 6647
Lets our secure our border.n" "Lets stop the drugs and the crime from pouring into our country, 6647, 6664

The world is talking about it, 6760, 6766
The world is talking about it and by the way if you havent been looking to whats been happening at the polls over the last three or four days I think you should start looking, 6766, 6801
You should start looking.n" "Together we can save American lives American jobs and American futures, 6801, 6816
Together we can save America itself, 6816, 6822
Join me in this mission were going to make America great again.n" Thank you, 6822, 6836
