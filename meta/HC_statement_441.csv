"Donald Trumps disrespect for our military knows no bounds, 0, 9
This week as brave American troops embarked on a crucial mission supporting anti-ISIS forces in Iraq Trump was already declaring defeat, 9, 30
He called our leaders stupid for not following his uninformed advice, 30, 41
And now hes personally insulting a military expert and retired Army Colonel who served for 30 years for knocking his plan." "A complex operation to take a major city – with hundreds of thousands of civilians untold traps and IEDs and the possibility of street-to-street fighting – requires careful planning and methodical execution not a fly-by-night bums rush." "But sadly none of this is surprising coming from Donald Trump, 41, 110
Over the course of this campaign he has claimed to know more about military operations than our generals do, 110, 129
He has mocked U.S, 129, 133
prisoners of war, 133, 136
He has insulted Gold Star families, 136, 142
He has joked about how he always wanted a Purple Heart, 142, 153
He has never apologized for any of it, 153, 161
He calls our military a disaster and then turns around and asks the country to make him our Commander-in-Chief, 161, 180
Its a disgrace and we can never let him assume that sacred role." , 180, 193
