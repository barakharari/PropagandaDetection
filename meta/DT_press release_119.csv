I found great opportunity in this country and I want everyone to have access to that same opportunity, 382, 400
I am very concerned that our political system on both sides of the aisle is blocking rather than creating that access to opportunity and is out of touch with the American values that have made America great, 400, 437
Since our inception our country has always been about creating an environment that fosters opportunity for everyone." Beal continued "Our government has lost sight of that fundamental principle that makes us all Americans, 437, 470
Instead government keeps growing at the expense of individual opportunity, 470, 480
Since the financial crisis our government has squandered many trillion of dollars in increased national debt with absolutely nothing to show for it, 480, 503
