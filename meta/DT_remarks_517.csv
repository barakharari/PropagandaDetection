Thank you, 0, 2
"Its great to be back here in beautiful Naples." In 16 days we are going to win the great state of Florida and we are going to win the White House, 2, 33
Early voting begins tomorrow and you can already get your absentee ballot so make sure to start voting, 33, 51
Yesterday I outlined my Contract with the American Voter – a detailed list of solutions to bring prosperity to our economy safety to our communities and honesty to our government, 51, 81
One of the issues I addressed at length is the issue of government corruption, 81, 95
I put forward a plan to stop it; my opponent has no plan to end government corruption because she is the embodiment of government corruption, 95, 120
Even as she was preparing to run for President WikiLeaks emails show Hillary was trying to get $12 million from the King of Morocco in yet one more Pay-For-Play scheme, 120, 150
"My goal is to keep foreign money out of American politics, 150, 161
Hillary Clintons goal is to put the Oval Office up for sale to whatever country offers the highest price." "So I have a message today to the voters of America, 161, 191
Its a message for Republicans Democrats and Independents, 191, 199
Its a message for those living in rural America urban America and suburban America – because we are all just One America." "Its a message for everyone who wants to take back our government from the special interests." And my message is this: if we win on November 8th we are going to fix our rigged system and we are going to Drain The Swamp Of Corruption In Washington D.C, 199, 269
That change includes a new foreign policy that puts America First, 269, 280
"Hillary Clintons foreign policy has squandered trillions in American wealth overseas, 280, 291
Yet for all the money spent all Clinton delivered was death destruction and terrorism, 291, 305
She unleashed ISIS and turmoil in Iraq Syria and Libya." Next trigger-happy Hillary wants to start a shooting war in Syria that could involve nuclear-armed Russia – she has bad judgment bad instincts and is just too reckless to be allowed into the Oval Office, 305, 350
Hillary also started the negotiations that led to the Iran deal – and thus ultimately leading to the $1.7 billion ransom for American hostages, 350, 374
Clinton gave Iran everything they wanted and more – including Iraq, 374, 385
Now Iran is emboldened as never before, 385, 392
In the latest insult to America the government of Iran is demanding "many billions" in new ransom payments for an American businessman and his ailing father, 392, 418
Adding to the insult Iran has released a video of their captive that includes footage from earlier this year of American soldiers being forced to their knees at gunpoint, 418, 447
"The humiliation for our country never seems to end – and its the humiliation brought on by a Secretary of State who was more interested in getting paid by foreign countries than in representing the country she lives in." "To cover-up her crimes as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton bleached and deleted 33000 emails lied to Congress under oath made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer – and then told the FBI she couldnt remember 39 times." The best evidence that the system is rigged is that Hillary Clinton is even allowed to run for President in the first place, 447, 549
"The Clintons grew their gross income by $60 million while Hillary was Secretary of State, 549, 564
Shes not a diplomat – shes a grifter always looking for an easy way to sell government favors and access in exchange for cash." The Clintons end up with the money and America ends up with the humiliation, 564, 602
When I am President America will be respected in the world once again, 602, 615
That also means standing up against the oppression of the Castro regime in Cuba and standing in solidarity with freedom-loving people in Venezuela and across Latin America living under oppression, 615, 645
The Obama-Clinton Administration has abandoned our friends in Latin America and delivered only poverty and joblessness for Hispanic-Americans here at home, 645, 666
"If you elect me along with a Republican House and Senate we will also immediately repeal the Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our badly depleted military, 666, 692
Its part of my 100-day plan." This will be a national effort that will involve everywhere from Key West to Tampa to the Space Coast to Jacksonville to the Panhandle, 692, 722
My proposal is based on three crucial words: Peace Through Strength, 722, 733
This defense build-up will be supported by ships in Mayport and by engineers and advanced manufacturing on the Space Coast, 733, 753
New aircraft will fly from MacDill Air Force Base and Naval Air Station Pensacola, 753, 767
New Navy and Coast Guard ships will patrol the Florida coast to prevent drugs and terrorists from entering our shores, 767, 787
With a Republican House and Senate we will also immediately repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare, 787, 805
Even Bill Clinton admitted Obamacare is "the craziest thing in the world" where "people wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half." Replacing Obamacare is part of my 100-day contract with the American Voter, 805, 843
A Republican House and Senate can swiftly enact the other items in my contract immediately including massive tax reduction and tax simplification for the middle class, 843, 869
My plan to transform our tax regulatory energy and trade policies is the most pro-growth plan in American history, 869, 888
It includes lowering our business tax from 35 to 15 percent, 888, 899
My reform plan will lift millions out of poverty raise wages dramatically and create at least 25 million new jobs in 10 years – and we can enact the whole plan in our first 100 days, 899, 935
A Trump Administration will also work alongside you to restore and protect the beautiful Florida Everglades, 935, 951
Our plan will also help you upgrade water and wastewater systems so that the Florida Aquifer is pure and safe from pollution, 951, 973
We will also repair the Herbert Hoover Dike in Lake Okeechobee, 973, 984
My contract includes something else at the very center of this campaign: fixing our trade deals and ending the offshoring of American jobs, 984, 1007
One more way our system is rigged against the American Worker is that companies like Carrier simply fire their workers and move their operations to Mexico and other countries, 1007, 1036
"When Im President if companies want to fire their workers and leave for other countries then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back into the United States." "We have a nearly $800 billion-dollar annual trade deficit in goods with the world, 1036, 1085
1 in 5 American households dont have a single person in that household with a job." Florida has lost 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton, 1085, 1124
"Weve lost 70000 factories since Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal." We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 1124, 1156
A Trump Administration will stop the jobs from leaving our country, 1156, 1167
We will start making things in America, 1167, 1174
We will be a rich nation once again, 1174, 1182
But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country, 1182, 1195
Immigration security is national security, 1195, 1200
Hillarys pledge for "open borders" includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within your communities and near your families, 1200, 1230
A new WikiLeaks email shows John Podesta secretly worried about the fact that Hillary Clinton never put procedures in place to keep the San Bernardino shooter out of America – including a plan to review social media postings, 1230, 1268
Were letting in Radical Islamic Terrorists right through the front door and stamping their visas "approved" on the way in, 1268, 1288
So let me state this as clearly as I can, 1288, 1298
"If Im elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country." We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration, 1298, 1323
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders, 1323, 1332
And yes we will build a wall, 1332, 1339
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, 1339, 1351
All across our nation innocent Americans have been killed by illegal immigrant criminals who should never have been in our country, 1351, 1372
"Kate Steinle was gunned down in her fathers arms in broad daylight on a San Francisco pier, 1372, 1389
Her killer had been deported 5 times before." 90 year-old Earl Olander was brutally beaten to death in his home by illegal immigrants with criminal records and left on the floor of his home to die, 1389, 1425
"Laura Wilkersons teenage son Josh was tortured and beaten to do by an illegal immigrant he offered to give a ride home, 1425, 1447
His body was viciously burned." The examples go on and on and on, 1447, 1460
Under a Trump Administration this crime wave will come crashing to an end, 1460, 1473
That includes the proposal in my contract for tough mandatory minimum prison sentences for illegal immigrants who re-enter the country after a previous deportation, 1473, 1497
With a victory in November everything will change, 1497, 1505
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America and we are going to end Common Core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1505, 1585
You have 16 days to make this all happen – but you have to get out and vote and that includes helping me elect a Republican Congress to enact my 100-day America-First action plan, 1585, 1619
Our failed establishment will be replaced with a new government guided by the principles I outlined in my contract with the American Voter, 1619, 1642
It will be a government of by and for the people, 1642, 1653
"For those who feel like they dont have a voice I have a simple reply: I Am Your Voice." "Im going to fight for every American in every last part of this nation." "Im going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests." And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1653, 1723
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1723, 1744
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life." This is a movement like the world has never seen before, 1744, 1769
"Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most" "important vote youve ever cast for anyone at any time." We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1769, 1801
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1801, 1807
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1807, 1813
And We Will Make America Great Again, 1813, 1820
