 Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton going at it this week as we begin this campaign in 2016 just two weeks from the Iowa caucuses, 0, 24
"Secretary Clinton joins us now from Charleston South Carolina ahead of tonights big debate." Good morning Madam Secretary, 24, 42
 Good morning George, 42, 45
" I want to get to that back and forth between you and Bernie Sanders but first the news that the American hostages from Iran are heading home this morning, 45, 75
Donald Trump not giving the president any credit and Marco Rubio says its going to create incentives for other U.S, 75, 95
adversaries to take hostages." Does he have a point? " Well look Im pleased like I hope everybody is that we have American citizens coming home this morning from Iran, 95, 125
They were unjustly held there and I did a lot of work on these issues when Americans were being picked up falsely charged and imprisoned to get them home, 125, 154
So I applaud the fact that thats happened." "We still dont see Bob Levinson coming home so we have unfinished questions and business still, 154, 178
But I think this is a part of what were going to be pursuing—persistent patient diplomacy." "Todays also the day that we have verified the Iranians have followed through on the requirements under the nuclear agreement, 178, 214
They have shipped out the vast majority I think its up to 98 percent of their enriched uranium, 214, 232
They have poured cement into one of the reactors we worried about because of a plutonium potential threat, 232, 250
They have destroyed centrifuges." "So this is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama that were just going to have to be persistent with because we have a lot of problems with Iran—their aggressive behavior their destabilizing of neighboring states their continuing military support for Assad and so much else." "But the fact that weve put the lid on the nuclear weapons program the fact that we got our prisoners back I think is a reason for good news." " Lets get to the campaign right now." "A strange series of events yesterday, 250, 356
The super PAC coordinating with you put out word that theyd be demanding to release of Bernie Sanders health records, 356, 376
Sanders campaign struck back calling that vile, 376, 383
Your campaign disavowed it, 383, 387
It appeared to go away." "So what is relevant here and whats not?" Should age and health be an issue in this campaign? " Oh look you know I put out my medical records, 387, 421
I think youve been around long enough to know George this is all part of the expectation." "But I think its fair to say that I share a lot of the same goals with Senator Sanders about what we need to do on behalf of our country, 421, 468
But we have differences, 468, 472
And thats what Im focusing on now, 472, 479
Were going to have a spirited debate I expect tonight in Charleston, 479, 491
Certainly Senator Sanders has been pointing out differences." And one of the issues that I have drawn a very stark contrast on has been guns, 491, 516
"You know I have pointed out repeatedly because I think its a critical issue that Senator Sanders has for years voted many times on behalf of the NRA gun lobby position, 516, 547
And one of the most egregious of those votes was the vote to give immunity from all liability to gun makers and sellers, 547, 570
Now I was happy when -"  He now supports taking that away, 570, 582
" Well he flip-flopped last night said that he would sign on to a bill that is currently pending in the House and Senate to repeal that liability, 582, 610
And Im delighted that he has had a change of heart, 610, 621
I think thats all for the good." "Now I hope he will take a hard look at what we call the Charleston loophole, 621, 644
Thats a provision he also voted for that gives a gun to a potential buyer after three days whether or not the background check has been completed, 644, 671
And its called the Charleston loophole because thats how the killer in Charleston got his gun when if there had been a little more time information would have come to light that would have shown he was prohibited, 671, 709
And of course we know he used that gun to go to Mother Emanuel Church and murder nine faithful people at Bible study." So I want to see movement against the gun lobby because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day 33000 a year to gun violence, 709, 758
And I welcome Senator Sanders moving on one of the issues he was wrong on, 758, 773
I hope he will continue to move, 773, 780
" And were going to ask him about that in a few minutes." Another big difference on health care, 780, 799
He wants to replace Obamacare with a single payer system Medicare for all, 799, 812
"So are you against that because its a bad idea or because its not practical? Would a single payer system be better if you could get it passed?" " Well first I share the goal of universal health care, 812, 851
You know very well that I threw myself into that back in 93 and 94 and still have the scars to show for it, 851, 875
So the goal is we want everybody to have access to quality affordable health care, 875, 890
But I think we should be defending the Affordable Care Act, 890, 901
This is a historic achievement for our country, 901, 909
It certainly is for President Obama, 909, 915
We are making progress, 915, 919
I want us to protect it to defend it and to improve it." "The Republicans keep trying to repeal it and offer nothing in place of it, 919, 946
So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start all over again in a contentious national debate lets do what Im proposing to get costs down get out of pocket costs down get more support for families who face big medical costs, 946, 992
Lets deal with the rising cost of prescription drugs, 992, 1001
That I think is the right way for the country to go and it certainly is what Im advocating." " You also have your differences over Wall Street, 1001, 1029
Weve heard a little bit of that going into this, 1029, 1039
And I was struck this morning American Crossroads a super PAC founded by Karl Rove who of course worked for President George W, 1039, 1062
Bush has just launched this online ad in Iowa."   " Hillary Clintons gotten 54 times more money from Wall Street interests than from all of Iowa, 1062, 1088
Hillary rewarded Wall Street with the $700 billion bailout, 1088, 1097
Then Wall Street made her a multi-millionaire."  I represented Wall Street, 1097, 1108
 Huh you sure did Hillary, 1108, 1113
   Now that echoes the points being made by Bernie Sanders in his campaign, 1113, 1126
Are you worried that your ties to Wall Street are weighing you down?  Well first let me say I think it shows how desperate the Republicans are to prevent me from becoming the nominee, 1126, 1160
I find that in a perverse way an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety because they know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs I will take it to the Republicans, 1160, 1196
I have a track record which shows I know how to stand up to them, 1196, 1211
And I will win, 1211, 1215
So I think this just proves my point that I am the strongest candidate to go up against any Republican, 1215, 1235
"With the back and forth on Wall Street I think its you know look I have stood up to Wall Street even though I did represent New York, 1235, 1263
I have advocated for changes, 1263, 1268
But what I find sort of strange is number one the ad that Senator Sanders ran was really against all Democrats who ever took any contributions from anybody associated with the financial industry, 1268, 1301
That would include President Obama who took more anyone ever had in 2008, 1301, 1314
That did not stop him from turning around and imposing the toughest rules on Wall Street since the 1930s, 1314, 1333
The same with Barney Frank who has actually written about this." You know that is just a false charge, 1333, 1352
"But in addition I think its important for us to look at our respective plans, 1352, 1367
In fact everyone who has offered an opinion about the plan that Senator Sanders has proposed and the one I put together has said mine is tougher mine is more comprehensive it would be more effective because it tries to get not just at the problems of yesterday but the potential problems of tomorrow going after shadow banking and investment banks and big insurance companies like what we saw in 08 where Lehman Brothers and AIG were principal causes of what happened to us." "And I think finally I would say that I have gotten maybe 3 percent of my - less than 3 percent of my contributions this time from anybody associated with financial industry activities, 1367, 1484
Ive gotten so much more from students and teachers, 1484, 1493
Ninety percent of my contributions are from smaller donors and 60 percent from women." "So Im just - you know I didnt know about Karl Roves ad against me but it kind of boosts me up because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and hes trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on their way to caucus for me."  Madam Secretary thanks very much for your time this morning, 1493, 1572
 Thank you, 1572, 1574
Good to talk to you George, 1574, 1580
