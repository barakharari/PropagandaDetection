"Every time Donald Trump opens his mouth he makes it even more clear that he doesnt have the qualifications or the temperament to be our Commander-in-Chief, 0, 26
His interviews this morning were especially revealing and even unhinged at times, 26, 38
"He once again claimed that he cant share his great foreign policy ideas because he wants unpredictability, 38, 55
He aggressively defended his Muslim ban, 55, 61
He lied about his own record claiming he opposed the Libya intervention and Iraq War -- both of which he supported at the outset, 61, 85
And he demonstrated once again his dangerous penchant for going ballistic on anyone who disapproves of his proposals, 85, 103
Rather than taking seriously criticism from former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates -- one of Americas most well-respected foreign policy minds -- Trump responded with a long tirade attacking Gates, 103, 133
This is the same petulance that was on display when he recently cast doubt on our special relationship with the UK simply because David Cameron and London Mayor Sadiq Khan criticized his proposed Muslim ban challenging the latter to an IQ test." This is not how presidents behave, 133, 181
We cant afford to have a Commander-in-Chief who has no understanding of foreign policy who has no coherent agenda and who wants to go to war every time someone says a mean thing about him, 181, 216
As Hillary Clinton said yesterday Donald Trump is simply not qualified for the job he seeks, 216, 232
This is not about ideology -- its about responsible leadership, 232, 242
Anyone who is serious about our national security regardless of their party should not stand with Donald Trump." xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 xa0 , 242, 266
