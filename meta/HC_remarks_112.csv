 And welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire, 0, 18
Thanks very much for being with us, 18, 25
You heard from Senator Bernie Sanders, 25, 31
Please welcome the former secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 31, 40
  Please, 40, 41
 Hello, 41, 42
 Welcome, 42, 43
 Thank you very much, 43, 47
" So youve obviously had a pretty incredible several past couple of days, 47, 60
Congratulations on winning in Iowa, 60, 65
New Hampshire has always been good to the Clintons, 65, 74
How does it feel out there?" " It feels great, 74, 84
Ive had just an amazing time, 84, 90
We landed in the middle of the night from Iowa still pretty pumped up about winning there and then got to work the next day, 90, 115
And Im seeing a lot of old friends meeting a lot of new people, 115, 129
I have an uphill climb and Im going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire, 129, 159
As you said theyre people that I feel very close to, 159, 170
Theyve been good to my husband to me my family, 170, 180
But whats most important is the first in the nation primary, 180, 191
It truly is a great opportunity to get out there explain what you want to do as president present your ideas and get vetted by the people of New Hampshire." " Bernie Sanders just a short time ago said he is the underdog here, 191, 235
Your campaign has said you know he comes from neighboring Vermont you guys are down in the polls, 235, 253
Do you feel you do better when youre fighting from behind?" " You know I dont know, 253, 270
I..."  Does it bring out something in you? " Well the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey whats at stake in this election because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary, 270, 311
But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama, 311, 340
"  "And so I — Im very proud of the campaign that Senator Sanders and I are running, 340, 358
I mean we really have focused on issues, 358, 366
We share a lot of the same big progressive goals but we have different ways of going about them, 366, 385
We bring different experiences, 385, 389
But we are contrasting on issues compared to the Republicans who I think are contrasting on insults, 389, 406
And I think its a better contest where we can take our ideas to groups like this throughout New Hampshire get questions have people vet them and then let the voters make up their minds." " Youve talked about progressive values, 406, 447
Earlier in the day Senator Sanders was asked if you were progressive, 447, 459
He said some days, 459, 463
Are you really a progressive? In the past you have said you plead guilty to being a moderate."  Well you know you asked me this question in the first debate right? " I did, 463, 497
And its coming up again today." " And I said that Im a progressive who likes to get things done, 497, 517
And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign Barack Obama would not be a progressive Joe Biden would not be a progressive Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive even the late great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive, 517, 587
So Im not going to let that bother me, 587, 596
I know where I stand, 596, 601
I know who stands with me, 601, 607
I know what Ive done, 607, 612
But I dont think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved, 612, 650
And I dont think its appropriate that you know if Planned Parenthood endorses me or the Human Rights Campaign endorses me you know theyre thrown out of the progressive wing and put into the establishment, 650, 685
Thats just not anything we need to do, 685, 693
Lets have a good contest of ideas, 693, 700
Lets contrast where we stand, 700, 705
And thats what I intend to do for the next couple of days."  It would obviously be historic if you were elected president first female president, 705, 731
 You think so?     " Ive studied a little bit of history, 731, 742
But it seems like young women arent rallying to this potentially historic moment, 742, 755
And I say this in Iowa among women under 30 Senator Sanders beat you by 70 points, 755, 772
Why do you think that is?" " Thats amazing, 772, 781
Yes, 781, 782
Look you know I was very fortunate to have a great team of young people men and women supporting me, 782, 802
But I accept the fact that I have work to do to convey what I stand for what Ive accomplished what I want to do for young people in our country." " Why do you think it is? That theyre..." " But I — well you know I dont really know Anderson, 802, 854
I think — heres what I want young people to know, 854, 865
They dont have to be for me Im going to be for them, 865, 878
It doesnt really matter, 878, 882
"  If they are not supporting me I will be their president I will do everything I can to give them the opportunities they deserve, 882, 907
"As I speak with young people across the country in Iowa New Hampshire and elsewhere I do sense this real feeling of being somehow disadvantaged put on the wrong side of American opportunity, 907, 940
And I understand that, 940, 944
I mean the student debt problems the feeling that the jobs that are out there are not producing the kind of income or opportunity that young people believe they should be able to get, 944, 978
But at the same time Im so impressed by the level the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment fighting climate change, 978, 1034
So Im impressed with them, 1034, 1039
And Im going to do everything I can to reach out and to explain why good ideas on paper are important, 1039, 1060
But youve got to be able to translate them into action to get results for people, 1060, 1076
I have a lot experience doing that, 1076, 1083
I think I can deliver positive change for young people in our country, 1083, 1096
And I hope to have the chance to win their support." " Whats wrong with a revolution?" " Well thats for Sen, 1096, 1118
Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people, 1118, 1133
I have a different take on it, 1133, 1140
I think the progress that we have made and particularly the Democratic Party has made has been hard fought for hard won and must be defended, 1140, 1166
So I want to defend the Affordable Care Act, 1166, 1175
It is one of the great accomplishments not only of this president but of the Democratic Party going back to Harry Truman, 1175, 1197
"  The Republicans are.., 1197, 1201
  You know the Republicans are determined to repeal it, 1201, 1210
And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies, 1210, 1224
Sen, 1224, 1225
Sanders and I share the same goal, 1225, 1232
We want to get to universal health care coverage, 1232, 1241
Before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare as you remember, 1241, 1253
 I remember, 1253, 1255
" I fought really hard, 1255, 1260
The insurance companies and the drug companies spent millions against me, 1260, 1271
I know what its like to go up against the status quo and special interests, 1271, 1286
So when President Obama succeeded I was thrilled, 1286, 1294
I dont agree with Sen, 1294, 1299
Sanders that we should start over that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again, 1299, 1320
Were at 90 percent coverage, 1320, 1325
Im going to fix what needs to be fixed, 1325, 1334
Were going to move from 90 to 100 which is a lot easier to get to than starting at zero to get to 100, 1334, 1358
So we have a difference, 1358, 1363
And I think that.., 1363, 1367
"  .., 1367, 1369
is the difference, 1369, 1372
 I want you to meet some of the folks in our audience, 1372, 1384
 Sure, 1384, 1385
" This is Dave Skinell, 1385, 1390
Hes a high school English teacher from Manchester, 1390, 1398
He says hes undecided, 1398, 1402
David?"  Hi David, 1402, 1405
 Hi Sec, 1405, 1407
Clinton, 1407, 1408
You — the next president will have as many as three Supreme Court appointments to make, 1408, 1424
 Right, 1424, 1425
" Im wondering beyond abortion are there any issues on which you would impose or assert a litmus test, 1425, 1444
And if your answer is no arent certain critical issues like marriage equality campaign finance just so vital to what we believe in as Democrats that you would have to know the answer as to how these justices would rule before you make the nomination?" " Well Ill tell you what Dave, 1444, 1496
I do have a litmus test, 1496, 1502
I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you, 1502, 1514
The next president could get as many as three appointments, 1514, 1524
You know one of the many reasons why we cant turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court, 1524, 1549
Im looking for people who understand the way the real world works who dont have a kneejerk reaction to support business to support the idea that you know money is speech that gutted the Voting Rights Act, 1549, 1586
I voted for the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act when I was in the Senate, 1586, 1602
It passed 98 to nothing based on a very extensive set of hearings and research, 1602, 1617
Supreme Court comes along, 1617, 1621
They substitute their judgment for the Congress signed by George W, 1621, 1632
Bush, 1632, 1633
That is one of our problems, 1633, 1639
They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is, 1639, 1665
So they have given way too much power to corporations, 1665, 1675
They have given Citizens United the biggest gift to the Koch brothers Karl Rove and all of those folks whose values I dont share and who are doing everything they can to try to turn the clock back, 1675, 1713
We have to preserve marriage equality, 1713, 1719
We have to go further to end discrimination against the LGBT community.., 1719, 1731
" " Weve got to make sure.., 1731, 1738
" " Weve got to make sure to preserve Roe v, 1738, 1749
Wade not let it be nibbled away or repealed." "Weve got work to do.., 1749, 1763
" " And heres how I think about it because when I was a senator I had to vote on Supreme Court justices, 1763, 1786
Im looking for people who are rooted in the real world who know that part of the genius of our system both economic and government is this balance of power, 1786, 1816
If it gets too far out of whack so that business has too much power any branch of the government has too much power the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it, 1816, 1867
So I have very strong feelings about what Ill be looking for if I am given the honor of appointing somebody to the Supreme Court, 1867, 1892
"   OK, 1892, 1894
  "I want you to meet Mr, 1894, 1900
Jim Kinhan, 1900, 1902
Hes a Democrat who says he is supporting you."  Hello Madam Secretary, 1902, 1914
 Thank you, 1914, 1916
" Im very pleased to see you, 1916, 1923
This may come a little bit from right field this may seem but its very personal to me and resonates probably with many other people who are elderly dealing with health issues, 1923, 1955
The question is coming to me as a person who is walking with colon cancer, 1955, 1970
And Im walking with colon cancer with the word terminal very much in my vocabulary comfortably and spiritually, 1970, 1988
But I wonder what leadership you could offer within an executive role that might help advance the respectful conversation that is needed around this personal choice that people may make as we age and deal with health issues or be the caregivers of those people to help enhance and — their end of life with dignity." " Well first of all thank you for being here, 1988, 2054
Thank you so much for being part of this great New Hampshire primary process and thank you for support, 2054, 2073
And I really appreciate your asking the question, 2073, 2081
And I have to tell you this is the first time Ive been asked that question."  I — I figured that, 2081, 2102
 Yes, 2102, 2103
I — I really — I really.., 2103, 2110
 Maybe any candidate, 2110, 2113
 And I thank you for it because we need to have a conversation in our country, 2113, 2129
There are states as you know.., 2129, 2135
 Yes, 2135, 2136
" — that are moving to open up the opportunity without criminal liability for people to make this decision in consultation by their families even in some cases with medical professionals, 2136, 2167
But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors, 2167, 2183
So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical religious faith-based perspective, 2183, 2201
So heres how I think about it, 2201, 2208
I want — I want as president to try to catalyze that debate because I — I believe youre right this is going to become an issue more and more..."  Exactly, 2208, 2239
" — often, 2239, 2242
We are on the good side having many people live longer but often then with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on but at some point dont want to continue with the challenges that poses, 2242, 2279
So I dont have any easy or glib answer for you, 2279, 2290
I think I would want to really immerse myself in the — the — the ethical writings the health writings the scientific writings the religious writings, 2290, 2316
I know some other countries the Netherlands and others have a quite open approach, 2316, 2330
Id like to know what their experience has been, 2330, 2339
Because we — we have to be sure that nobody is coerced nobody is under duress, 2339, 2355
And that is a difficult line to draw, 2355, 2363
So I thank you — I thank you so much for raising this really important absolutely critical question that were all going to have to do some thinking about."  Thank you  , 2363, 2394
  " I think this is Michael Feel, 2394, 2401
Michael is a married father of one, 2401, 2408
He says hes undecided, 2408, 2412
Hes learning — leaning toward Senator Sanders, 2412, 2419
Michael?"  Hi Michael, 2419, 2422
" Hi Secretary Clinton, 2422, 2426
As senator and as secretary of State you have a history of interventionist foreign policy that is troubling to many Democratic voters including myself, 2426, 2450
As a voter who is opposed to the United States being the worlds policeman can you assure me that as president you would not expand our military involvement abroad?" " No I cant Michael, 2450, 2484
I mean I — Id like to be able to say I could but heres what I can say, 2484, 2503
I have learned and have been you know really in the crucible of making a lot of hard decisions over the last years, 2503, 2526
And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice, 2526, 2539
That is one of the biggest differences between me and the Republicans." "I worked very hard as secretary of State to do what I could diplomatically to avoid conflict, 2539, 2568
Thats why I worked to get the coalition together to impose sanctions in Iran so that we could get them to the negotiating table in order to test whether we could get an agreement to put a nuclear weapons agreement in place, 2568, 2610
I did that in large measure motivated by my deep concern that the absence of effective diplomacy might very well have sparked an arms race among some very unstable nations in the region and maybe even led to conflict, 2610, 2649
I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad getting us involved in military conflicts, 2649, 2668
But I cant in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in Americas best vital national security interest, 2668, 2707
So I want to be honest with you, 2707, 2715
I will do what I can I will stand against adventurism ill thought out missions, 2715, 2730
I will not send American combat troops to Iraq or Syria, 2730, 2741
That is off the table, 2741, 2746
That would be a terrible mistake, 2746, 2752
We will continue to use Special Forces and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face, 2752, 2771
You know the network of terrorist organizations — not just ISIS but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia — pose serious threats to friends allies and partners as well as to ourselves, 2771, 2813
And weve got to keep our country safe and we have to work with the rest of the world to try to defeat ISIS to end that terrorist threat, 2813, 2842
So I will be a very careful deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices because I know whats at stake, 2842, 2862
And I know you can understand why there cant be from me anyway a blanket statement, 2862, 2878
But I want to assure you I will be transparent I will be open and I will explain to the American people if any occasion arises where we do have to take military action to protect ourselves or our close friends and partners."  I want to follow up the — yesterday on Capitol Hill the Senate Armed Services Committee the Commander of the Marine Corps said that he thinks and I quote all eligible and qualified men and women should register for the draft talking about Selective Service, 2878, 2966
Do you think women should also have to register for Selective Service like men? " You know the first time I heard that yesterday and heres the reasoning as best I I understand from listening to the testimony excerpts, 2966, 3005
That if were going to open combat positions to qualified women so that they can compete to be Army Rangers they can compete to be Navy Seals they can compete to be Infantry Officers in the Marines then we have expanded the definition of the all-volunteer military, 3005, 3052
I I have to think about whether I think its necessary to go as far as our military officers are recommending, 3052, 3073
You know from my perspective the all-volunteer military has worked and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country, 3073, 3108
The idea of having everybody register concerns me a little bit unless we have a better idea of where thats going to come out, 3108, 3132
Where I want people to register I want every young person to register at the age of 18 to be able to vote automatically and I think if — if we had you know if we had a system like that I would I would be very very pleased about it, 3132, 3183
I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system, 3183, 3204
So I just have to be better informed about why theyre making this recommendation." " I want you to meet Rebecca Hutchinson, 3204, 3226
Shes a former State Representative in New Hampshire, 3226, 3234
She says shes undecided and shes got a question for you."  Hi Rebecca, 3234, 3247
" Thank you, 3247, 3250
I feel in a way I sort of have a follow-up to the previous question, 3250, 3265
You clearly have very impressive foreign policy experience and Ive heard you point out to us that President Obama chose you and trusted you to be his Secretary of State, 3265, 3295
But I get stuck when I think about you voted for the Iraq war which you now say was a mistake, 3295, 3316
What have you learned since that vote that could give me confidence that you wouldnt make a mistake of that magnitude again?" " Oh I think thats a very fair question, 3316, 3347
You know I did make a mistake and I admitted that I made a mistake, 3347, 3362
And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administrations approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq, 3362, 3384
The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections, 3384, 3413
And he made that comment, 3413, 3418
And the U.N, 3418, 3421
Inspector Hans Blix said give us the time we will find out, 3421, 3433
Give us the hammer over their head namely the vote and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD, 3433, 3459
And the Bush administration didnt give them the time, 3459, 3468
And that was a breach of faith in my view, 3468, 3478
But you know I gave them the vote in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out short of invasion, 3478, 3506
Turned out not to be, 3506, 3511
And I really regret that thats the way President Bush proceeded, 3511, 3522
That would not be something you would have to worry about with me, 3522, 3535
If I tell you were going to do diplomacy were going to hang tough were going to get answers thats exactly what we will do." " I want you to meet Sean Burke, 3535, 3568
Hes a Democrat from Derry says he is a supporter of yours, 3568, 3580
Sean?"  Hi Sean, 3580, 3583
 Hey, 3583, 3584
Once you become the nominee and got elected how are you going to defend yourself against right-wing attacks?  Well Sean I had a lot of practice, 3584, 3610
 " So I could laugh up here but its not easy, 3610, 3621
It is a brutal experience, 3621, 3626
And when it first started happening to me back in the early 1990s when I was working on health care, 3626, 3646
And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself, 3646, 3655
What talk radio was saying what Republican members of Congress and their allies were saying, 3655, 3670
I was just stunned, 3670, 3674
I could not understand how they got away with it, 3674, 3684
And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously but not personally, 3684, 3697
And by that I mean this, 3697, 3703
The very fair question from Rebecca, 3703, 3709
People ask you questions or criticize you think about it seriously, 3709, 3720
There are lessons to be learned often from people who dont agree with you, 3720, 3734
But dont take it personally so that it just paralyzes you literally stops you in your tracks, 3734, 3751
And so now that Ive been through this for so many years Sean my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed, 3751, 3779
They play to keep, 3779, 3783
They play to destroy, 3783, 3787
They are constantly doing whatever they can to win, 3787, 3796
And they have a history now going back you know 35-36 years of going after people who they believe they cant otherwise stop unless they engage in that negative attack, 3796, 3826
So right now for example a couple of hedge fund billionaires have started a super PAC to run ads against me, 3826, 3847
Karl Rove has you know solicited money from Wall Street to run ads against me, 3847, 3862
I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say, 3862, 3884
And I will stand in their way and I will stop them from perpetuating an agenda on America that is bad for our democracy bad for our economy bad for our societies, 3884, 3916
So I know I have to keep defending against them, 3916, 3926
But Im the one who has the experience to do that, 3926, 3937
Its unlike anything youve ever gone through to be the subject of tens of millions of dollars of untrue terrible attacks, 3937, 3958
And now the Koch brothers say theyre going to spend $750 million to defeat the Democratic nominee, 3958, 3975
Im still standing and I will be standing, 3975, 3983
So dont worry about that, 3983, 3988
"   Let me just simply follow up, 3988, 3995
You mentioned attacks on the early 1990s, 3995, 4002
 Right, 4002, 4003
" Do you still believe theres a vast right-wing conspiracy?" " Dont you? "  " Im asking you." " Yes, 4003, 4023
Its gotten even better funded, 4023, 4028
You know they brought in some new multibillionaires to pump the money in." "And look these guys play for keeps, 4028, 4048
They want to control our country, 4048, 4054
Senator Sanders and I agree on that completely, 4054, 4062
They want to rig the economy so they continue to get richer and richer they could care less about income inequality, 4062, 4083
They salve their consciences by giving big money to philanthropy and you know getting great pictures of them standing in front of whatever charity they donated to, 4083, 4110
But make no mistake they want to destroy unions, 4110, 4119
They want to go after any economic interests that they dont believe they can control, 4119, 4134
They want to destroy our balance of power, 4134, 4142
They want to go after our political system and fill it with people who will do their bidding, 4142, 4160
I said today in Dover you know I dont think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they dont know because theyre not scientists, 4160, 4191
Theyre just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers, 4191, 4200
Theyre told dont you dare say climate change is real because were in the fossil fuel business, 4200, 4217
So this is exactly what they are up to, 4217, 4226
And yes.., 4226, 4228
" " .., 4228, 4231
it is probably — look at this point its probably not correct to say its a conspiracy because its out in the open, 4231, 4254
You know there is no doubt about what theyre doing and who the players are and what theyre trying to achieve, 4254, 4275
And theyre shopping among the Republican candidates to figure out who among them will most likely do their bidding, 4275, 4294
So just know what were up against because its real and were going to beat it, 4294, 4310
But its going to take everybody working together, 4310, 4318
"  " I want you to meet Alison Pyott, 4318, 4327
Shes an independent torn between you and Senator Sanders."  Hi Alison, 4327, 4338
" Im sensing a theme here, 4338, 4344
First thank you so much for all youve done for our country and for women."  Thank you, 4344, 4361
 My question is the number of factors some you have just described have eroded trust in you, 4361, 4378
What will you do to regain that trust engender trust in Americans and me? " Well thank you for starting by saying its related to what I just said, 4378, 4407
And I acknowledge this as personally painful as it is, 4407, 4417
When you have been subjected to the level the velocity of attacks that come every day even if there is no factual basis to it its just normal for people to say gosh there has got to be something why do they keep saying this and then we do that, 4417, 4467
And you know I testify for 11 hours theres nothing to Benghazi they dont give it up they keep coming after it, 4467, 4489
So I know that I have to really demonstrate as clearly as I can who I am what I stand for and what Ive always done, 4489, 4515
Ive always been guided by the same values, 4515, 4523
I have always listened to people, 4523, 4529
And Ive always worked as hard as I could to produce results for people, 4529, 4543
So when I ran for the Senate the first time and I was out there and you know people were barraging I was running first against Rudy Giuliani and all of that, 4543, 4575
And I was able to just keep going and tell people heres who I am heres what I do I want to do this with you, 4575, 4601
And I won, 4601, 4604
And then since years later when I ran I got a higher percentage, 4604, 4617
And then I did have as you all remember a really tough campaign against then-Senator Obama, 4617, 4633
We saw each other very up close and personal, 4633, 4642
And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state because he trusts me he trusts my judgment he trusts my experience, 4642, 4668
So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs find ways to help people whether its on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans whatever it might be, 4668, 4711
And I trust the American people, 4711, 4717
I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you, 4717, 4752
And thats what I hope you will understand, 4752, 4760
"  " I want to welcome Rabbi Jonathan Spira-Savett, 4760, 4769
Hes an independent says hes undecided about his vote, 4769, 4778
Rabbi?"  Hello Rabbi, 4778, 4781
 Hello, 4781, 4782
Another rabbi Rabbi Simcha Bunem taught that every person has to have two pockets and in each pocket they have to carry a different note, 4782, 4807
And the note in one pocket says the universe was created for me, 4807, 4820
And in the other pocket the note says I am just dust and ashes, 4820, 4834
And I want you to take a moment and think about what you would tell us about your two pockets, 4834, 4854
"How do you cultivate the ego the ego that we all know you must have a person must have to be the leader of the free world and also the humility to recognize that we know that you cant be expected to be wise about all the things that the president has to be responsible for?" " Another absolutely wonderful question, 4854, 4915
Thank you Rabbi, 4915, 4918
I think about this a lot, 4918, 4924
Um I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility about service and self-gratification all of the human questions that all of us deal with but when you put yourself out into the public arena I think its incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible, 4924, 5000
This is hard for me, 5000, 5005
You know I never thought Id be standing on a stage here asking people to vote for me for president, 5005, 5025
I always wanted to be of service, 5025, 5032
I met my husband who was such a natural knew exactly what he wanted to do, 5032, 5048
I was happy to support him while I worked in the Childrens Defense Fund and legal services and taught law and you know had our daughter, 5048, 5074
I never thought I would do this, 5074, 5081
And so I have had to come to grips with how much more difficult it often is for me to talk about myself than to talk about what I want to do for other people or to tell stories about you know the man I met in Rochester who — whose AIDS medicine is no longer affordable, 5081, 5138
And that — that can grip me and make me feel like theres something I can do about that, 5138, 5157
So Im constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am what I believe in and what I want to do to serve? I have that dialogue at least you know once a day in some setting or another, 5157, 5216
And I dont know that there is any ever absolute answer like OK universe here I am watch me roar or oh my gosh I cant do it its just overwhelming I have to retreat, 5216, 5251
Its that balance that I keep to try to find in my life that I want to see back in our country, 5251, 5273
And it will be something that I continue to talk about with a — you know with a group of faith advisers who are close to me, 5273, 5300
I get a scripture lesson every morning from a minister that I have a really close personal relationship with, 5300, 5319
And you know it just gets me grounded, 5319, 5327
He gets up really early to send it to me, 5327, 5337
So you know there it is in my in box at 5:00 a.m., 5337, 5350
I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes give me readings that are going to be discussed in services, 5350, 5371
So I really appreciate all that incoming, 5371, 5378
And the final thing I would say because again its not anything Ive ever talked about this much publicly everybody knows I — I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years, 5378, 5415
And so Ive had to be in public dealing with some very difficult issues and personal issues political public issues, 5415, 5435
And I read a um a treatment of the prodigal son parable by the Jesuit Henri Nouwen who I think is a magnificent writer of spiritual and theological concerns, 5435, 5464
And I — I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me, 5464, 5485
And it basically is practice the discipline of gratitude, 5485, 5494
So regardless of how hard the days are how difficult the decisions are be grateful, 5494, 5509
Be grateful for being a human being being part of the universe, 5509, 5521
Be grateful for your limitations, 5521, 5526
Know that you have to reach out to have more people be with you to support you to advise you listen to your critics answer the questions, 5526, 5553
But at the end be grateful, 5553, 5559
Practice the discipline of gratitude, 5559, 5564
And that has helped me enormously, 5564, 5570
"  " Were going to have more questions from the audience for Secretary Clinton when we come back." "Well take a short break."   " Welcome back to CNNs Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire, 5570, 5610
We are here with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 5610, 5620
I want to play a piece of video..."  OK, 5620, 5629
 ...from Senator Sanders the other night in Iowa after the votes came in and get you to respond, 5629, 5647
 OK, 5647, 5648
  " We do not represent the interests of the billionaire class Wall Street or corporate America, 5648, 5664
We dont want their money, 5664, 5669
We will.., 5669, 5671
And I am very proud to tell you that we are the only candidate on the Democratic side without a Super PAC, 5671, 5693
And the reason that we have done so well here in Iowa the reason I believe were going to do so well in New Hampshire and in the other states that follow the reason is the American people are saying no to a rigged economy."    We got a number of questions even from people who support your policies who say they do believe that you represent the interests of Wall Street and corporate America, 5693, 5767
How do you respond? " Well look thats just not the case, 5767, 5779
And I did represent New York obviously." "There was no doubt that I took on a lot of what was going down on Wall Street including calling them out on the mortgage issues calling for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even before we got one created calling for changes in CEO pay, 5779, 5831
But I honestly think that the best answer to this is the fact that everybody that I know who looks at whats happening in this campaign sees the same thing, 5831, 5861
The Wall Street interests the money interests the Republican political interests are spending a lot of money to try to defeat me, 5861, 5883
So I just find it kind of a strange argument, 5883, 5893
I happen to agree with Sen, 5893, 5899
Sanders, 5899, 5900
Im not just going after Wall Street though, 5900, 5908
I think thats too narrow a target, 5908, 5915
I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe, 5915, 5952
Its a perversion, 5952, 5955
It should be stopped, 5955, 5959
I want to go after the hedge funds that have bought up drug companies you know Valeant Pharmaceuticals Turing Pharmaceuticals taking drugs that have been around a long time and upping the price, 5959, 5992
So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked to get the odds favoring the average American again.., 5992, 6022
" " And but I just have to — I have to respectfully say I think Sen, 6022, 6039
Sanders target is too small I really do, 6039, 6047
You know I respect him going after the big banks, 6047, 6057
I agree with him, 6057, 6061
No bank is too big to fail, 6061, 6068
No executive to powerful to jail, 6068, 6074
But we actually passed the process to be able to take on banks that pose excessive risk in our financial system in Dodd-Frank, 6074, 6097
So lets know the next president has to implement but doesnt have to achieve that, 6097, 6112
Heres what I want to do, 6112, 6118
I want to go after all the other culprits, 6118, 6127
It wasnt just the big banks, 6127, 6133
It was the insurance company AIG, 6133, 6139
It was the investment bank Lehman Brothers, 6139, 6146
It was Countrywide Mortgage, 6146, 6150
It was Wachovia, 6150, 6153
There were a lot of bad actors, 6153, 6160
And if all you do is look over here Im telling you theyre going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk, 6160, 6198
So Ive got no argument that we need to take on these vested interests, 6198, 6212
I just have a wider group that I think we need to go after from pharmaceuticals.., 6212, 6228
" " .., 6228, 6231
insurance companies shadow banking and other corporations that I think are undermining our ecoomy, 6231, 6245
And frankly they are undermining our democracy, 6245, 6252
This Johnson Controls thing really infuriates me, 6252, 6259
We bailed them out, 6259, 6263
The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail, 6263, 6272
They didnt care about the millions of jobs, 6272, 6280
Barack Obama and the Democratic Congress gave them a bailout, 6280, 6290
It turned out to be a good deal, 6290, 6298
All of us paid for it, 6298, 6304
They paid back the Treasury, 6304, 6309
So we didnt lose any money and we saved millions of jobs, 6309, 6321
And the auto industry just had a great year, 6321, 6330
Johnson Controls was one of those begging for the bailout, 6330, 6340
And now theyre not going to pay their taxes? Were going to go right after that, 6340, 6356
That is absolutely wrong, 6356, 6360
"  And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that, 6360, 6373
   One of the things.., 6373, 6377
  One of the things that Sen, 6377, 6383
Sanders points to and a lot of your critics point to is you made three speeches for Goldman Sachs, 6383, 6402
You were paid $675000 for three speeches, 6402, 6409
Was that a mistake? I mean was that a bad error in judgment?  Look, 6409, 6423
I made speeches to lots of groups, 6423, 6430
I told them what I thought, 6430, 6436
I answered questions, 6436, 6439
 But did you have to be paid $675000? " Well I dont know, 6439, 6452
Thats what they offered so..."  You know every secretary of State that I know has done that, 6452, 6469
 But  " for office theyre not running for an office..." " Well I didnt know..."  .., 6469, 6485
have known, 6485, 6487
" To be honest I wasnt — I wasnt committed to running, 6487, 6499
I didnt know whether I would or not." " You didnt think you were going to run for president again?" " I didnt, 6499, 6522
You know when I was secretary of State several times I said you know I think Im done, 6522, 6540
And you know so many people came to me started talking to me, 6540, 6553
The circumstances the concerns I had about the Republicans taking back the White House because I think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody, 6553, 6589
I did not want to see that happen again, 6589, 6598
I want to defend President Obamas accomplishments and the progress weve made, 6598, 6610
I want to go further, 6610, 6615
So yes I was convinced, 6615, 6620
But you know anybody who knows me who thinks that they can influence me name anything theyve influenced me on, 6620, 6640
Just name one thing, 6640, 6644
Im out here every day saying Im going to shut them down Im going after them, 6644, 6660
Im going to jail them if they should be jailed, 6660, 6670
Im going to break them up, 6670, 6676
I mean theyre not giving me very much money now, 6676, 6686
I can tell you that much, 6686, 6692
"  Fine with me, 6692, 6696
"Im proud to have 90 percent of my donations from small donors and 60 percent the highest ever from women which Im really really glad about, 6696, 6722
"  " So just to be clear thats not something you regret those three speeches that money?" " No I dont because you know I dont feel that I paid any price for it and I am very clear about what I will do and theyre on notice." " I want to see if Chris Lopez is here, 6722, 6780
Chris there you are, 6780, 6784
Chris is an independent with a question for Secretary Clinton, 6784, 6794
She says shes undecided I should point out, 6794, 6802
Chris?"  Hi Chris, 6802, 6805
" Hi, 6805, 6807
Thanks for taking my question, 6807, 6812
I see a lot of hypocrisy in this country when I have a really hard time getting the medicine I need and yet its really easy to get alcohol, 6812, 6841
What will you do to decriminalize marijuana so people — so I and people like me can get the pain and spasm relief that we need?" " I will do a lot Chris because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions youve just briefly described, 6841, 6905
I want to move it from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II so that we can begin to do more research, 6905, 6928
The NIH and a lot of universities can begin to try to find out, 6928, 6942
Because I want you to know what we know from science, 6942, 6953
But I also want you to be able to use it while were doing the research, 6953, 6969
And so many states as you know have moved to provide legal protection for the use of medical marijuana, 6969, 6988
I support that, 6988, 6991
I think that the states are the laboratories of our democracy, 6991, 7002
We should be learning about what works what doesnt work, 7002, 7012
Different states have actually listed the kind of illnesses and conditions that it can be used for, 7012, 7029
Are they right? We dont know, 7029, 7035
Thats why we have got to do the research, 7035, 7044
I also want you to know what dosage is right what interacts with the other medication youre taking, 7044, 7062
I want to accelerate this because I have no doubt that there are very real benefits for people, 7062, 7080
We know in chemotherapy we know from other conditions in using the right amount of the right kind of marijuana, 7080, 7100
I just want to make sure its the right amount and the right kind, 7100, 7114
Thats why I want to get that research up and going as quickly as possible, 7114, 7129
But you said something else which I think is really important, 7129, 7140
We cant be here in New Hampshire and not talk about the addiction problem in New Hampshire, 7140, 7157
Not talk about the fact that there have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes in this state, 7157, 7176
Not talk about the lives that are being destroyed the people that I meet the grandmothers raising their grandchildren because theyve lost their children, 7176, 7200
I just left a rally in Manchester and a woman grabbed my hand and she said I just lost my son to an overdose, 7200, 7224
So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen like Governor Hassan like Governor Shumlin of Vermont who supports me to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach a new law enforcement approach so that first-time low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs? There are 23 million people who need help in our country both alcohol and drugs, 7224, 7299
There are 10 percent of the kind of spaces that they need to take care of those people, 7299, 7317
So weve got to work on law enforcement, 7317, 7325
We have to work on doctors to understand better when they prescribe opioids which is often the first step towards heroin, 7325, 7346
We have to have every police department equipped with naloxone which is the antidote to reverse overdose save lives here in New Hampshire, 7346, 7369
Weve got to put more money into this, 7369, 7377
So all of this to me fits together, 7377, 7385
You deserve answers about marijuana and we deserve more treatment for people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol for other kinds of challenges, 7385, 7409
So thats what I would like to do, 7409, 7417
"  " I want you to meet — this is Julie Carnigan shes from Windham, 7417, 7432
Julie?"  Hi, 7432, 7434
 Hi, 7434, 7435
Thank you for taking my question, 7435, 7441
Im the proud mother of five girls two of my own three step- daughters, 7441, 7455
And unfortunately they are all "feeling the Bern." And I would like to know what you would do to convince them to vote for you, 7455, 7480
 How old are they? " Theyre in their — 21 22 and a couple of 23s and a 25-year-old, 7480, 7499
"  " Well first of all tell them Im glad theyre interested in politics and I really mean that, 7499, 7518
I want them to be involved, 7518, 7524
I want them to feel like I felt when I was that age some years ago and getting excited and interested in politics for the first time." I also want them to take a look at my record what I have done my entire life starting as a young lawyer working for the Childrens Defense Fund taking on the problem of juveniles incarcerated with adults in South Carolina trying to gather information to end segregated academies in the South, 7524, 7603
I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers standing up for equality under the law defending peoples rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve, 7603, 7641
And then I hope they will look at what I have accomplished from you know starting the Childrens Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids looking at ways to try to be smart in reforming our adoption and foster care system with very partisan Republicans when I was First Lady, 7641, 7692
Getting healthcare for our National Guard, 7692, 7698
Helping to negotiate and implement a treaty to reduce nuclear weapons, 7698, 7709
A long list, 7709, 7712
And the reason I say that is I think its very important that as people move toward the primary on Tuesday whatever your age you really think about what someone is proposing and what their record is about getting it done, 7712, 7753
And as Ive said and I mean it absolutely I have the highest respect for Senator Sanders, 7753, 7770
But as the "Concord Monitor" said today in its writing about this you know its its very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable, 7770, 7799
So I dont want to over promise, 7799, 7806
Weve got too much of that, 7806, 7812
I want to tell people what I will do, 7812, 7821
I want to be specific because I do want to — to go back to the question I was asked earlier — recreate the trust that seems to have been splintered in America, 7821, 7854
We need to set big goals again, 7854, 7861
I am all for that, 7861, 7866
I have big ambitious goals, 7866, 7871
Affordable college early childhood education making sure that we are on the path to paid family leave all of which will help your daughters, 7871, 7895
But I also want them to hold me accountable, 7895, 7904
I want them to say OK hows that actually going to happen? What do we have to do to make it? Weve got to get 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate, 7904, 7938
Nancy Pelosi has said were not going to revisit healthcare, 7938, 7948
Were going to stick with the Affordable Care Act, 7948, 7957
Thats exactly where I am, 7957, 7962
Were going to improve it, 7962, 7967
Because I am somebody who wants to actually produce a real difference in peoples lives, 7967, 7982
I am a progressive who gets results, 7982, 7989
And I will be a progressive President who gets results, 7989, 7999
And the final thing I would say is it is still the case that there are challenges and obstacles to young womens ambitions, 7999, 8022
And Im going to try to break the highest and hardest glass ceiling, 8022, 8035
I hope it splinters completely and and I hope for your daughters it opens doors that might not be open right now regardless of whether any of them ever do any politically, 8035, 8067
But in their lives their profession how theyre treated, 8067, 8076
I hope it does give them more of a sense of empowerment, 8076, 8088
Thats what I want for my daughter and my amazing granddaughter and thats what I want for your daughters, 8088, 8107
  ", 8107, 8108
Just as we did with Senator Sanders weve talked about a lot of important policy issues, 8108, 8124
I just want to ask kind of a couple of personal questions just for voters to get..." " You dont think they know everything?" " Well I dont know, 8124, 8153
Well see about that, 8153, 8157
Its interesting to me I mean you have — as you said you have been one of the most famous women in the world now for for decades, 8157, 8185
You have no anonymity, 8185, 8189
If you could be anonymous for just one day what would you do?" " I used to do this in the White House and you know I would I would put on a baseball cap and sunglasses and you know sweat pants and a sweat shirt and put my hair back and I would go walk, 8189, 8245
And I would tell the Secret Service they had to wear casual clothes they had to take the things out of their ears they had to look like they were just tourists, 8245, 8277
I had the best time you know, 8277, 8284
I would I would end up over on the Mall sometimes walking around, 8284, 8297
And a family would come up and say would you mind taking our picture in front of the White House, 8297, 8317
Id be happy to, 8317, 8321
Here why dont you.., 8321, 8325
So you know theres nothing I like better than to be anonymous as hard as that is to achieve, 8325, 8344
So I would spend the day you know out in nature talking a long walk walking through one of the beautiful towns here in New Hampshire stopping in a cafe stopping in a bookstore, 8344, 8378
You know maybe calling some of my friends some of whom are here tonight and say dont tell anybody but meet me you know there, 8378, 8403
Thats what I thats what I want to do and its what I get the great joy out of, 8403, 8422
I am so fortunate that I still have my friends from grade school and every other phase of my life, 8422, 8442
And they keep me grounded they keep me honest they deflate my head they deal with the universe in one pocket and the dust and ashes in the other, 8442, 8471
"  "So any time I get to spend time with them, 8471, 8482
And then of course it would have to end with seeing my granddaughter because thats the creme de le resistance..."  What does she call you?  She calls me grandma, 8482, 8511
Grandma, 8511, 8512
Yes, 8512, 8513
Shes working really hard on words, 8513, 8519
And it was so thrilling, 8519, 8524
They came to Iowa that last weekend because we obviously werent going to leave, 8524, 8538
And so they got in late the night Saturday night, 8538, 8548
And Sunday morning Im getting ready, 8548, 8554
And you know Bill and I are you know having coffee and everything, 8554, 8567
So Chelsea brings her in and she sees me, 8567, 8576
She goes "grandma", 8576, 8579
And honest to goodness the caucus couldve ended right there, 8579, 8589
I wouldve been perfectly happy.., 8589, 8594
 " .., 8594, 8596
saying the best thing has happened to me right this minute in Iowa, 8596, 8609
So thats where Id end my day."  You talked about the circle of friends you have, 8609, 8625
Obviously in 2011 your mom passed away, 8625, 8632
 Right, 8632, 8633
 In 2008 she was part of your campaign, 8633, 8641
 She was, 8641, 8643
 And you wrote about how at the end of the day you would you know sit around the kitchen table with her kick off your shoes and just talk about everything that had happened, 8643, 8677
 Right, 8677, 8678
 What do you think — what advice do you think she would give you today in this campaign in this year? " You know my mother truly is my inspiration because she had such a terrible miserable life and was abandoned and rejected by her own family and was out at the age of 14 working as a housemaid, 8678, 8737
And her resilience her love her ability to have her own family to take such good care of us was just you know to me the ultimate accomplishment in any life, 8737, 8768
And she would always give me the advice she gave me as a little girl, 8768, 8783
You know you get knocked down, 8783, 8789
Everybody gets knocked down, 8789, 8793
What matters is whether you get up, 8793, 8800
And when you get up what do you do? How do you behave? Are you going to be bitter? Angry? Upset? Are you going to try to be positive get something done help somebody else? And Im sure thats exactly what shed be saying now, 8800, 8845
Shed be encouraging me, 8845, 8849
Shed be very proud a little apprehensive because you know its a brutal business being in politics, 8849, 8866
And people say things about those you love whether its your daughter or someone else, 8866, 8881
So she was very supportive, 8881, 8886
But you could tell you know how much pain she kind of absorbed from time to time, 8886, 8903
And so I would sit with her and I would say dont listen to that stuff mom, 8903, 8920
And shed say well I have to know what theyre saying about you, 8920, 8933
And Id say you know dont put yourself through that, 8933, 8943
And so that would be what shed be doing now I think too, 8943, 8956
