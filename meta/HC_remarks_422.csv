"Thank you, 0, 2
Thank you, 2, 4
Thank you so much, 4, 8
Wow, 8, 9
 Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! "Thank you so very very much, 9, 18
Wow, 18, 19
I am so happy to be back here and to be here with all of you, 19, 35
I am thrilled, 35, 38
And I cant thank you enough." "And its a special privilege and pleasure to be introduced by my friend and such a great leader someone who has served not only this state so well but also our country, 38, 76
And so I want to thank -- once again I want to thank former senator and former secretary Ken Salazar." "And I also want to thank somebody else whos here who is really special and is doing such a great job for all of you, 76, 121
And that is your senator and I hope you will get out and send him back to Washington Michael Bennet." "I also want to recognize someone whos running a great race for congress Gail Schwartz." I -- I was thinking -- I was thinking the first time I came to this beautiful place and had a chance to meet people from here was in 1992, 121, 186
I was here for somebody else namely my husband who was running for president, 186, 200
And I know there are a lot of really young people here but was anybody here back in 1992? "Well Bill and I talk about Pueblo all the time, 200, 229
And it is always a treat for either one of us to come, 229, 242
And today its especially important because we are getting closer and closer and closer to the next election, 242, 260
And were also very conscious of the fact that here in Colorado for the first time you are all going to be able to vote by mail." And this Monday October 17th ballots will start being mailed to Colorado voters, 260, 300
"Now if youve already registered to vote I hope youll keep your eye open for the mail and fill out your ballot, 300, 322
Send it back as quick as you can, 322, 330
Dont wait to fill it out." Dont do what I do put it on the kitchen counter and then you put something else on top of it and something else and pretty soon youre wondering "Where is that ballot? I know it cam here a few days ago." So please put it in the mail so we can get every early vote counted quickly and avoid a big backlog on election night, 330, 402
"And maybe -- if you havent registered to vote yet please do it right now, 402, 417
And if you go to Iwillvote.com you can do that on your phones -- you do that right now -- you can get registered, 417, 441
Pretty easy huh?" "Because we need everybody to vote in this election, 441, 453
And we need your friends and your family and everyone you can reach because this is about something so important, 453, 473
I dont know that theres ever been a more serious or consequential election, 473, 486
And we can see that people feel that way because across America people are already voting in high numbers." "A lot of states have whats called early vote and the numbers are bigger than anybody thought, 486, 522
And bigger than theyve been in the past." "Just this morning in Ohio people began lining up last night so they could be sure to vote, 522, 548
They couldnt wait to cast their ballots, 548, 555
And by the time were done we expect record numbers of people to vote in this presidential election." "So dont be left out because we need you, 555, 582
And oh by the way if youve got friends in Utah or Arizona make sure they vote too, 582, 600
We are competing everywhere and the polls are tightening because I think Americans want to turn out as big a number as possible to reject the dark and divisive and hateful campaign that is being run by my opponent." And you know your vote can make all the difference, 600, 649
I was in Florida yesterday with former Vice President Gore, 649, 659
"And as he said yesterday take it from him every vote counts, 659, 671
So dont sit this one out, 671, 677
And Im very proud of the campaign weve run, 677, 686
Im proud of the campaign Bernie Sanders and I ran." It was about -- it was about issues not insults, 686, 706
We were setting forth a positive agenda that would help America, 706, 717
And help millions and millions of Americans get ahead and stay ahead, 717, 729
"And to me that is what were supposed to be doing, 729, 740
Were supposed to bring people together, 740, 746
Were supposed to unify our country, 746, 752
Were supposed to solve our problems by working together." "And I know its been a long race but as soon as our primary finished Senator Sanders and I got together and came up with a plan to make college affordable and pay back student debt provide more healthcare, 752, 800
And we have done our best to stay out of all the meanness." You know the other night -- did you see that last debate? Well I was watching my opponent just go lower and lower and lower, 800, 838
And I was reminded of what my friend and our first lady Michelle Obama says, 838, 853
When they go low we go high, 853, 860
And I want you to know I want to be -- I want to be the president for everyone, 860, 879
I am tired of the all the divisions and the barriers, 879, 890
I want to bring people together across our party lines across any lines that divide us, 890, 906
And not just people who vote for me I want to be the president yes for Democrats but also Republicans and Independents, 906, 928
"And I am very grateful for all of the Republicans who are supporting me, 928, 942
And I am very -- Im very appreciative of all of the newspapers that are endorsing me some of whom have never endorsed a Democrat before." "So were going to keep running this campaign, 942, 976
I want to give you something to vote for not just something to vote against." "And during these next 28 days were going to crisscross our country, 976, 1003
Were going to be talking about what we can do together, 1003, 1014
But Donald Trump is taking a very different tone." His campaign -- his campaign said today that theyre going to use a quote "scorched Earth" strategy for the remaining four weeks of this race, 1014, 1048
Now that just shows how desperate they are, 1048, 1056
Thats all they have left pure negativity pessimism, 1056, 1064
"And were not going to let Donald Trump get away with it are we?" "I dont care what he says about me, 1064, 1086
I -- I -- I care about what he says about you, 1086, 1098
And Ill tell you what I will stand up and defend every single person in this country from the insults and the disrespect that we hear from him." Now the whole world has heard how Donald Trump treats women and what he thinks of women, 1098, 1143
And he is doubling-down on his excuse that its just quote "locker room talk." Well you know what happened? It just kind of happened spontaneously, 1143, 1168
A lot of athletes and coaches started posting on Twitter and Instagram and Facebook, 1168, 1182
I mean the National Basketball Association Major League Baseball the NFL and more, 1182, 1195
They are coming together and theyre saying "That doesnt happen in our locker rooms." But of course you know its not only women that he has disrespected, 1195, 1222
Hes insulted practically everybody, 1222, 1226
He went after a distinguished federal judge Judge Curiel who was born in Indiana, 1226, 1240
And Trump said "Well he couldnt be trusted because his parents were Mexican." "He has targeted immigrants African Americans Latinos, 1240, 1260
Hes targeted POWs people with disabilities moslems and so many others." "And every time he does that I get somebody who is worried or scared writing me a letter or talking to me, 1260, 1293
And especially children, 1293, 1296
Its really who Donald Trump is, 1296, 1302
But when you scare children you know like a little boy, 1302, 1313
His mother wrote to me, 1313, 1318
She had adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler, 1318, 1329
There were a lot of children in Ethiopia that were no longer able to live with families, 1329, 1346
Their parents their grandparents were not around, 1346, 1353
And a lot of Americans have adopted children in need like that and this little boy named Felix is now ten years old, 1353, 1376
Hes only lived in the United States, 1376, 1383
And his mother wrote me and she said that after hearing Donald Trump he turned to her and asked Mommy will he send me back to Ethiopia?" "Thats the kind of fear and anxiety that I hear from immigrant families who are scared to death especially the children that Donald Trump is going to put together a big deportation force and go door to door school to school business to business home to home." And it is hard to explain to children, 1383, 1465
And so I hope that if you know any children who are listening and watching and hearing some of what is said you will reassure them, 1465, 1491
I want every boy and girl to know the American dream is big enough for you and there is a place in America for you, 1491, 1516
And that in this election we will demonstrate that America is better than what Donald Trump says and represents, 1516, 1535
"But heres what I also want to know, 1535, 1543
We have a big difference about how best to get the economy going, 1543, 1556
You know Trump wants to give trillions and trillions in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires." "You know thats called trickle down economics but as with anything when it comes to Donald Trump he wants to have the biggest tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations than we have ever ever had, 1556, 1608
So I believe differently, 1608, 1612
Were going to invest in the middle class, 1612, 1620
Were going to invest in you in your jobs in your future."  Hillary! Hillary! Hillary! "Well you know you do have to feel a little sorry for them, 1620, 1648
Theyve had a really bad couple of weeks." "But you know part of the difference in how we see the economy I think comes from our experiences, 1648, 1675
You know Donald grew up the son of a millionaire, 1675, 1685
He got started in business by borrowing $14 million from his dad, 1685, 1697
So its not a surprise he wants to keep giving back to the wealthy because thats his own experience, 1697, 1716
I grew up differently, 1716, 1720
My father was a factory worker, 1720, 1726
Well my grandfather was a factory worker, 1726, 1733
My father was a small businessman, 1733, 1739
I know how hard they worked and I am grateful for the middle class life that they gave us and thats what I want to make sure everybody gets." "Thats why I believe weve got to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top and were going to focus on those issues, 1739, 1795
Were going to make it possible to have more good jobs in infrastructure, 1795, 1808
We need to fix our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports and our airports." "And we need to make sure that the rich pay their fair share because heres what weve learned Donald Trump hasnt paid a penny in federal income tax in years." "Now this is all allegedly because of course we dont know for sure because he wont release his income taxes but its allegedly because he lost $1 billion running casinos, 1808, 1883
Now I ask you who loses $1 billion running casinos right?" "Do you know how hard that is? But think about it it means hes contributed zero, 1883, 1910
Zero for our military zero for our vets zero for education and health and he has the gall to go around disrespecting our military." He calls the United States military a disaster, 1910, 1942
Well the only disaster is somebody who can get away with paying no taxes and have the gall to run for president and criticize all the rest of us who have done our part to support America, 1942, 1979
"Now youve all heard his slogan Make America Great Again right? Well that would have maybe some truth to it if he made anything in America and if he bought things that are made in America, 1979, 2015
There are so many examples but let me just give you one which is close to your hearts because Pueblo is one of the largest steel producing cities in America right?" So you know how important it is to support our steel workers and our steel industry, 2015, 2062
"Now Trump is the guy who went around for a year talking about how he was on the side of workers and all the rest of it, 2062, 2089
No truth to it but you know he did say it over and over again and weve slowly but surely uncovered how little hes done to help anybody except Donald Trump." And he has bought Chinese steel for his buildings, 2089, 2129
Not American steel, 2129, 2132
He could be buying American steel he should be buying American steel, 2132, 2144
If he wants to make America great again start by America with American steel, 2144, 2158
"I have a very different idea and in addition to jobs and infrastructure which uses American steel were going to do more on advanced manufacturing on technology and innovation on clean energy jobs and were going to make the economy fairer at the same time, 2158, 2203
And heres what I want the young people and their families to hear." Senator Sanders and I got together on a plan, 2203, 2225
We are going to make public college tuition free for working families and debt free for everyone else, 2225, 2243
"If you already have debt because youre trying to get your education were going to help you refinance it, 2243, 2262
It is wrong that you could refinance a home and refinance car but you cant refinance your student debt, 2262, 2281
And were going to make it possible for you to pay it back as a percentage of your income." Now based on this plan we will save millions of people thousands of dollars and you can go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator to see how much you and your family can save, 2281, 2330
Because we want to liberate young people and families from the burden of college debt, 2330, 2345
"And were also gonna make the economy fairer by raising the national minimum wage so people who work full-time wont be in poverty." "And were going to expand Social Security for those who need it the most - low income seniors and widowed women." And we are going to pass comprehensive immigration reform, 2345, 2398
"Im going to introduce reform, 2398, 2403
I cant wait to work with Senator Bennet I cant wait to have a chance to make sure that we are working on immigration reform from the very beginning, 2403, 2432
Were gonna finally help dreamers achieve their dream of following their future and becoming American citizens." "I also think it is past time dont you to guarantee equal pay for womens work?" "You know I started talking about equal pay years and years and years ago because its not only a womans issue its a family issue, 2432, 2489
If you have a wife or a daughter or a mother or a sister its your issue, 2489, 2506
Right? You know that." "So Donald Trump always says you know Im playing the woman card, 2506, 2522
And my response is pretty simple, 2522, 2528
If being for equal pay and affordable childcare and paid family leave is playing the womans card then deal me in." You see I am very excited I am very excited about what we could do, 2528, 2564
You know I give President Obama a lot of credit, 2564, 2574
He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, 2574, 2584
I remember because he called and asked me to come see him shortly after the election, 2584, 2600
And I didnt know why, 2600, 2605
He wanted me to be secretary of state but I didnt know that, 2605, 2618
But I got there and the first thing he says is "Its so much worse than they told us." "And it was, 2618, 2640
You remember, 2640, 2642
It was terrible, 2642, 2645
Millions of people lost their jobs and homes were lost and it was just a horrible time, 2645, 2662
We have dug ourselves out of that ditch thanks to everybodys hard work." "And we cant ever go back there because believe me trickle-down economics and refusing to regulate Wall Street and the mortgage market is what got us into that mess in the first place." "And Donald Trump wants to get rid of the new rules on Wall Street, 2662, 2722
He wants to get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which returns money to people whove been defrauded by big companies, 2722, 2744
Well I have a totally different view." "Were gonna keep those and then were going to tell companies that try to move jobs out of our country that if they try to theyre gonna have to pay an exit tax and return every penny every penny of tax benefit theyve ever gotten." "And Ive been very clear about how were gonna pay for what I want to do, 2744, 2812
It is going to be going after the wealthy closing the loopholes on corporations." I can pledge to you I will never raise middle class federal taxes, 2812, 2839
It is not right, 2839, 2843
"And what Ive been trying to do listening to people around the country is figure out what we can do to help you with what I call kitchen table issues, 2843, 2873
And we thank you very much." What - right now - thank you, 2873, 2886
"You know I always feel so welcome when I come to Pueblo, 2886, 2898
I think Ill come here anytime it gets hard in the White House, 2898, 2911
What do you say?" Finally I want to tell you that I want to make it easier for you to raise your kids, 2911, 2934
You know there is nothing more important, 2934, 2941
"Im now a grandmother of two wonderful grandchildren a little girl a little boy, 2941, 2955
And there are too many hard-working families struggling with the cost of raising children." "So right now most families with kids get something called the child tax credit, 2955, 2983
It gives a middle-class family $1000 per child to help you defray the costs, 2983, 2997
Im going to double - Im going to double the child tax credit." "Thats another $1000 for young kids to pay for the things you need whether its child care housing prescription drugs groceries or anything else it is just one example of the tax relief I want to give to working families and were going to make sure that it gets to the people who need it most." "Were going to lift families out of poverty, 2997, 3074
In fact the changes I am proposing we think will automatically help more people get out of poverty and were going to look for other ways to help you." What I am interested in is your success your futures your possibilities your dreams, 3074, 3117
I want to be a president who makes it possible for more people to feel like they are really moving and their kids are going to have better lives, 3117, 3146
"That is how I was raised, 3146, 3152
Thats what I want for you and every single family every single child in America!" "So we have about four weeks ago, 3152, 3174
Its going to be - its going to be a race to the finish line my friends, 3174, 3191
And here is what I want to ask you." As I said in the beginning think about everything that is important to you whether it is jobs and rising incomes whether it is education healthcare whatever it might be, 3191, 3230
Whether it is protecting our rights, 3230, 3236
People who have fought so hard whether it is immigration reform whatever it might be think about it because you know what? Those issues will be on the ballot, 3236, 3265
They may not be listed there but you could not have two more different people running for president than me and Donald Trump, 3265, 3288
"And I know that if people turn out I know if people show up were going to win and were going to be able to do everything Ive talked about." And so it call comes to down whether or not you take that ballot you get in the mail you fill it in you send it back you do everything you can to make sure that your vote will be counted, 3288, 3359
You know when I think about this election I do think about my grandchildren a lot, 3359, 3375
Yeah you too right? "Ill tell you what for those of you who arent grandparents yet it is an incredible experience, 3375, 3396
Right?" "And there is nothing I wouldnt do for them, 3396, 3406
As I like to say face time was invented for grandparents and you get to check in and see how theyre doing, 3406, 3428
But more than that what kind of lives are they going to have and what kind of country is going to be waiting for them?" "I know how important it is that families and communities and our country stand behind every child, 3428, 3470
Make sure every child has a good education a good school good teachers and every zip code in America, 3470, 3489
Make sure every child -- every child has the healthcare that he or she needs, 3489, 3504
Thats why I work to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program so we can take care of millions of children." "Thats why every family deserves to have a good job with a good income to be able to be good providers for their kids." "I got into this work so many years ago, 3504, 3557
I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund right out of law school, 3557, 3571
And I spent my time trying to figure out how you even the odds for all kids, 3571, 3588
And the reason I did that is because of my own mother." "I didnt know it when I was just a little girl but I learned as I got older that my mother was abandoned and neglected by her parents and pretty much left on her own and then at the age of eight holding her little three-year-old sisters hand she was put on a train by themselves to go to California to live with grandparents." "It turned out the grandparents didnt really want her either, 3588, 3674
So by the age of 14 she was working in a house as a maid and a babysitter, 3674, 3692
But heres what I want you to know, 3692, 3700
It sounds pretty harsh, 3700, 3704
It was difficult, 3704, 3707
It made a profound impression on her life, 3707, 3715
I think my mom who lived to the wonderful age of 92 I dont think there was a day that went by that she didnt think about being abandoned and being sent away and being pretty much left on her own." But along the way people were kind to her, 3715, 3765
People helped her, 3765, 3768
The first grade teacher who brought lunch for her every day because my mother never had any -- the woman whose house she went to work in all those years ago knew my mother wanted to go to high school so she said to her Dorothy if you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school, 3768, 3831
"Now youll have to come right back home, 3831, 3839
That might sound kind of unfortunate but for my mom it was a gift because she really wanted to go to high school." And so my mother always cared about other people, 3839, 3871
And she taught me in every way she could that nobody is better than anybody else right, 3871, 3888
And we need to show each other more kindness and support, 3888, 3899
And the last thing we need in our country are more bullies making people feel bad about themselves and pushing people away we should be drawing people toward us, 3899, 3928
"We should be creating the kind of future we want for every one of our children, 3928, 3944
Thats what I think about when I imagine if Im so fortunate enough to become president I think about waking up -- waking up —" I think about waking up in the White House every morning trying to figure out what can I do to help somebody else and who can I work with? How many families and communities across America will work with us to come up with ideas that give every single child the chance to live up to his or her God given potential? "Thats what I think we are called to do, 3944, 4040
Whether youre a person of faith or not the American dream is really premised on people coming together to lift each other up, 4040, 4063
Nobody nobody makes it alone, 4063, 4068
Everybody has somebody who helps them along the way." So lets pull together Pueblo lets get out and vote for the kind of positive future we want for ourselves and our children, 4068, 4100
God bless you thank you." , 4100, 4105
