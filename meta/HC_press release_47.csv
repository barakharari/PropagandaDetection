"Shes a progressive who gets things done." "Want to know what it means to be a progressive who gets things done? Just look at what Hillary Clinton has done—and what shes fighting to do." "As first lady of Arkansas she worked to expand health care access to rural parts of the state, 0, 52
And as first lady of the United States Hillary did something unprecedented: She helped lead the fight for health care reform—and when it didnt pass she worked with Democrats and Republicans in Congress to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program which currently provides 8 million low-income kids with health care, 52, 102
She kept fighting as a U.S, 102, 108
senator securing health care for 9/11 first responders and expanding access to care for the National Guard Reservists and their families." "In 2010 Democrats finally achieved the health care reform they spent generations fighting for—and so far 18 million Americans have gotten coverage and millions more have received benefits like free preventive care and the promise that theyll never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, 108, 175
We cant afford to tear it up and start over, 175, 185
Thats why Hillary will defend the Affordable Care Act from Republicans who want to repeal or dismantle it (theyve already tried 50 times), 185, 208
But she wont stop there—she also has a plan to lower out-of-pocket costs like co-pays and deductibles and make prescription drugs more affordable—and as president shell get it done." "Theres good reason for that: As senator Hillary co-sponsored and voted for legislation to close the gun show loophole by requiring criminal background checks on all transactions taking place at events that sell firearms, 208, 271
Unlike Bernie Sanders she voted against the dangerous immunity protections Congress provided gun dealers and manufacturers that prevent victims of gun violence from holding the gun industry accountable, 271, 299
And she co-sponsored and voted for legislation to extend and reinstate the assault weapons ban, 299, 314
Hillary has always stood up to the gun lobby—and that wont change as president." "Hillary will fight to pass comprehensive background check legislation and to close the loopholes that help put guns in the wrong hands including the gun show loophole and the loophole that let the Charleston shooter legally purchase a gun, 314, 367
Shell hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable repealing the gun industrys sweeping immunity from lawsuits, 367, 382
And shell work to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers other violent criminals and the severely mentally ill." "Making college affordable isnt just a campaign promise for Hillary—shes been working on it since her days as first lady of Arkansas, 382, 425
She helped found the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund which has helped more than 38000 people attend college, 425, 443
Then as a U.S, 443, 447
senator she introduced legislation to give students the option of income-based loan repayment, 447, 460
She also introduced a bill to make Pell Grants available year-round so nontraditional students could afford to pursue their education during the summer months, 460, 484
And she co-sponsored legislation to help student borrowers refinance their loans." "Under Hillarys plan students would never have to borrow money to pay for tuition to attend a four-year public college in their state, 484, 518
And the 25 million Americans with student debt will be able to refinance their loans at current rates—which could save borrowers thousands of dollars each." Hillary supported comprehensive immigration reform legislation every time it came up for a vote during her time as a U.S, 518, 563
senator, 563, 564
She co-sponsored the DREAM Act three times, 564, 571
As president Hillary will fix our broken immigration system—with or without help from Congress, 571, 585
"That starts with comprehensive immigration reform once and for all with a path to full and equal citizenship that treats every person with dignity, 585, 609
But if Congress refuses to act shell defend President Obamas executive actions that provide relief from deportation for DREAMers and their parents and shell do everything possible under the law to protect immigrant families including a system for parents of DREAMers and others who have contributed to this country to make their case and be eligible for deferred action." "Hillary has been fighting for women and girls since she graduated from law school: Instead of taking a job at a big law firm she went to work at the Childrens Defense Fund as an advocate for women and families, 609, 708
As first lady she advocated for the Family and Medical Leave Act and worked to increase funding for child care, 708, 728
And as a U.S, 728, 732
senator from New York she championed the Paycheck Fairness Act co-sponsored the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and fought for legislation to guarantee paid sick leave and paid parental leave for all federal employees." "Thats why at the Democratic debate in Charleston South Carolina Hillary said that closing the wage gap would be one of her earliest priorities as president, 732, 792
Shell also fight for paid family leave because the United States is the only developed country in the world without guaranteed paid leave of any kind, 792, 818
And shell make quality affordable child care a reality for families across the country." , 818, 832
