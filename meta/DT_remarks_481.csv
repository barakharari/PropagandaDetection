It is a privilege to be here this morning with so many distinguished members of our armed services, 0, 18
"Before we get started with our Q & A Id like to address one of the most important aspects of Americas national security and thats Cyber Security." To truly make America safe we must make cybersecurity a major priority for both the government and the private sector, 18, 65
Cyber theft is the fastest growing crime in the United States, 65, 76
As President improving cyber security will be an immediate and top priority for my Administration, 76, 91
One of the very first things I will do is to order a thorough review of our cyber defenses and weaknesses including all vital infrastructure, 91, 116
Cyber-attacks from foreign governments especially China Russia and North Korea along with non-state terrorist actors and organized criminal groups constitute one of our most critical national security concerns, 116, 144
Hillary Clintons only experience in cyber security involves her criminal scheme to violate federal law engineering a massive cover-up and putting the entire nation in harms way, 144, 171
The fact that a former Senator and Secretary of State claimed not to know what the letter "C" means is just one more example of why shes unfit to hold public office, 171, 203
"The scope of our cyber security problem is enormous, 203, 212
Our government our businesses our trade secrets and our citizens most sensitive information are all facing constant cyber attacks." Just consider some of these recent hacks: JP Morgan Chase had 73 million emails stolen, 212, 246
E-Bay was invaded and gave up 150 million passwords, 246, 255
Target was attacked and gave up 40 million credit card numbers, 255, 266
Attacks like these are happening on a regular basis both in the United States and around the world and the costs in our privacy our security and on our financial sector are extraordinary, 266, 299
Identify theft financial laundering as well as ransom ware – involving the extortion of a hacked institution – are all becoming increasingly common, 299, 322
Incredibly hackers were able to obtain at least 20 million identities of people who underwent FBI background investigations, 322, 340
The information hacked contains facts discovered by the FBI in doing background checks for people seeking positions with the Federal Government, 340, 361
It is a treasure trove which can be easily used for blackmail, 361, 373
The fact that this highly classified information was so poorly protected demonstrates that cyber security is just one more area where the Obama Administration has failed, 373, 399
We should not let this be like the history of the Mafia which was allowed to grow into a nation-wide organization which infiltrated and corrupted so many areas of society for such a long time, 399, 434
We can learn from this history that when the Department of Justice the FBI the DEA and state and local police and prosecutors were combined in Task Forces directed at the Mafia they were able to have great success in prosecuting them seizing their business interests and removing their infiltration from legitimate areas of society, 434, 489
As President I will instruct the Department of Justice to create Joint Task Forces throughout the United States to work together with Federal State and local law enforcement authorities and international law enforcement to crush this still-developing area of crime, 489, 529
I will make certain that our military is the best in the world in both cyber offense and defense, 529, 548
I will also ask my Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs to present recommendations for strengthening and augmenting our Cyber Command, 548, 569
"As a deterrent against attacks on our critical resources the United States must possess the unquestioned capacity to launch crippling cyber counter-attacks, 569, 591
This is the warfare of the future Americas dominance in this arena must be unquestioned." Cyber security is not only a question of developing defensive technologies but offensive technologies as well, 591, 622
For non-state terror actors the United States must develop the ability – no matter how difficult – to track down and incapacitate those responsible, 622, 646
We should turn cyber warfare into one of our greatest weapons against the terrorists, 646, 660
To enhance the defense of the other agencies of government including our law enforcement agencies we will put together a team of the best military civilian and private sector cyber security experts to comprehensively review all of our cyber security systems and technology, 660, 703
The Cyber Review Team will proceed with the most sensitive systems first but ultimately all systems will be analyzed and made as secure as modern technology permits, 703, 730
I will also require that follow-up reviews take place on a regular basis determined by the sensitive nature of the security involved, 730, 752
The review will include providing exact recommendations for the best combination of defensive technologies tailored to specific agencies, 752, 770
This will include the various methods of internal monitoring attack and penetration investigation of suspected hackers or rogue employees and identity protection for government employees, 770, 795
The review team will also remain current on the constantly-evolving new methods of attack and will attempt to anticipate them and develop defenses as often as possible before major breaches occur, 795, 826
This group of experts will set up protocols for each agency and government officials requiring them to follow best practices, 826, 846
They will also establish a training program for all government employees to make certain they understand what defenses are available and utilize them along with a continuing education program so everyone is aware of the newest methods of both attack and defense, 846, 888
Those who violate classification rules will be held responsible to the fullest extent of the law, 888, 904
I will appoint an Attorney General who will reform the Department of Justice like it was necessary after Watergate, 904, 923
My Attorney General will restore the integrity of the Department of Justice, 923, 935
Today is just the beginning of a long and overdue national discussion of how to protect ourselves from modern cyber-crime and evolving national security threats and how to develop the cyber offense strategies necessary to gain a critical security edge in the 21st century, 935, 979
