Thank you, 0, 2
I always look forward to coming back to Iowa a state where I have so many friends – including your incredible governor Terry Branstad, 2, 26
We are doing so well in Iowa a recent Reuters poll had us up by 10 points, 26, 43
On November 8 we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House, 43, 62
"Its going to be a victory for YOU the American people." We are going to take on the special interests the lobbyists and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans, 62, 97
We are going to create a new government that serves you your family and your country, 97, 113
Lower taxes less regulation more affordable childcare fair trade deals secure borders thriving family farms and millions and millions of new jobs, 113, 135
We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service, 135, 151
Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for insiders, 151, 160
I am an outsider fighting for you, 160, 167
Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money, 167, 185
In her campaign for President Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds, 185, 206
She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms, 206, 216
The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government, 216, 231
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State, 231, 248
"And dont forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – or all the favors and access granted to those who wrote checks, 248, 275
She even gave up 20% of American Uranium to Russia." "She disgraced the office of Secretary of State by putting it up for sale - and if she ever got the chance shed put the Oval Office up for sale too." "We cant let that happen, 275, 321
Thats why you have to go out and vote on November 8th and early voting in Iowa starts tomorrow." She deleted and bleached 33000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, 321, 350
13 phones missing several destroyed with a hammer, 350, 358
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals, 358, 370
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server, 370, 379
Lies to Congress under oath about turning over her work-related emails, 379, 390
The Clintons have perfected the politics of profit, 390, 398
The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 398, 416
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 416, 436
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 436, 453
"The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton, 453, 465
Thats why Hillary Clinton is pushing for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees." She and her financial backers will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country, 465, 505
The American people have had it with corrupt Clinton ways, 505, 515
They are tired of the lies they are tired of the trivial politics they are tired of being talked down to looked down upon and treated like second class citizens, 515, 545
How many more Clinton scandals can this country take - one after another after another? They are the sordid past, 545, 565
We are the bright future, 565, 570
While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions, 570, 594
Never in American history have so many serious challenges been met with so unserious a campaign as the campaign of Hillary Clinton, 594, 616
This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough, 616, 628
"Its time for real change – a new foreign policy a new economic policy a new immigration policy a new trade policy." Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for African-American communities, 628, 665
I dont think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart and they know they are being used, 665, 690
They also know that shell do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does and that will never change, 690, 713
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators." Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over, 713, 757
Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation, 757, 783
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries, 783, 803
I am not running to be President of the World, 803, 813
I am running to be President of the United States of America, 813, 825
"From now on its going to be America First." Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen? "Why cant we have the schools we want and the borders we want and the security we want? Why cant we have policies that support small business or family farms or the miners and the steelworkers?" "The answer is simple, 825, 893
Because the financial interests who control our politics and our media dont want these changes to happen." "These special interests control Hillary Clinton, 893, 916
She is their chosen representative, 916, 921
You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money, 921, 935
Shes there for only one reason to protect her donors." "Look at her career, 935, 949
Shes been there for 30 years and has never done anything for you and your family, 949, 965
Shes failed at everything, 965, 969
She failed in Iraq in Libya in Syria in Iran in Egypt, 969, 981
She failed on Russia on China on North Korea." She failed upstate New York, 981, 995
She failed the inner cities, 995, 1000
"Shes failed women and children, 1000, 1005
Ive created thousands of jobs for women in this country of incredible talent, 1005, 1018
Hillary Clinton has been in Washington for 30 years and now 70 million American women and children are in poverty or on the brink of poverty." And she has been a disaster on our borders, 1018, 1053
"Id like to invite on up here Michelle Root the mother of Sarah Root who was killed by an illegal immigrant released into the country under the Obama catch-and-release policies championed by Hillary Clinton." Hillary Clinton supports Sanctuary Cities, 1053, 1092
Where was the Sanctuary for Sarah? The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors, 1092, 1110
Just Follow The Money, 1110, 1114
Her single greatest achievement may be getting away with her massive e-mail scandal and criminal cover-up, 1114, 1130
"Our campaign is taking on big business big media and big donors – were taking them on for YOU, 1130, 1149
So you can have the future you want." That includes keeping your family safe, 1149, 1163
"New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in Americas large cities and that its the largest single-year increase in 45 years." More than 3000 people have been shot in Chicago since January, 1163, 1198
60% of murder victims under the age of 22 in this country are African-American, 1198, 1212
45% of African-American children under the age of 6 are living in poverty, 1212, 1225
I will never back down from fighting to save American lives, 1225, 1236
I will never back down from fighting to create safety and wealth for our inner cities, 1236, 1252
My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 1252, 1267
We will cut your taxes reduce regulations – including on our farmers – negotiate great trade deals unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 1267, 1296
We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child – including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America, 1296, 1322
The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton, 1322, 1339
Remember: Follow the Money, 1339, 1343
"Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C, 1343, 1355
Were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives." "Theyre all part of the same political establishment, 1355, 1380
They go to the same restaurants they attend the same conferences they have the same friends and connections, 1380, 1398
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable." I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country, 1398, 1426
Government will start working again, 1426, 1431
Fixing things is what I do, 1431, 1437
Just look at my projects in New York and around the world where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines, 1437, 1457
An article in the New York Post was published recently called "How Donald Trump helped save New York City." The article said quote: "Trump waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out… Trump — almost by force of will — rode to the rescue, 1457, 1524
Expressing rare faith in the future he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead." "Thats what I want to do for our country – I want to go into the neglected neighborhoods the failing schools the forgotten stretches of this nation and unlock their potential for all of our people." Together we can accomplish anything we want, 1524, 1589
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th – and it means you need to start voting early, 1589, 1612
Early voting is so important, 1612, 1617
You have to knock on doors, 1617, 1623
You have to pick up that phone, 1623, 1630
You have to campaign on the streets, 1630, 1637
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country, 1637, 1652
To beat the system you have to lift your voice pound the pavement and get out the vote, 1652, 1670
Visit our website to find out how you can help, 1670, 1680
You have six weeks until the election, 1680, 1687
You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true, 1687, 1703
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation, 1703, 1721
The arrogance of Washington D.C, 1721, 1726
will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 1726, 1740
This November 8th we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before, 1740, 1764
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1764, 1836
We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1836, 1848
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1848, 1868
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1868, 1877
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation, 1877, 1895
American workers will be hired to do the job, 1895, 1904
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 1904, 1916
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1916, 1938
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1938, 1959
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 1959, 1981
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 1981, 1994
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1994, 2000
We Will Make America Strong Again, 2000, 2006
We Will Make America Safe Again, 2006, 2012
And We Will Make America Great Again, 2012, 2019
Thank you and God Bless! , 2019, 2024
