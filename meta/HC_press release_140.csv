and a moment that will stick with me for the rest of my life, 1, 15
 A few hours later I was on a plane heading to Michigan, 15, 27
"Michigan is a very special place to me, 27, 35
Before working for Hillary I served as Senator Debbie Stabenows chief of staff, 35, 48
I fell in love with the state—its beautiful landscapes its tremendous manufacturing, 48, 60
I learned that grit and charm are at the heart of what it means to be from Michigan." "I saw Mayor Karen Weavers determination to keep advocating on behalf of the community even when others were saying she couldnt make a difference, 60, 102
I saw the relief of a local journalist when she realized that someone was finally listening to what she had been reporting for months, 102, 126
And I saw the deep faith of ministers in and around Flint who were doing everything they could to guide their congregations through such tough times." Why? Because Hillary has spent her entire life fighting for families and for communities like Flint, 126, 168
She wanted to hear directly from the people who are being affected so that she could find ways to make a practical difference in their lives, 168, 194
 "When Hillary got to Flint we headed to a church, 194, 204
We sat together as she bore witness to the pain of a mom who has tried to shield her son from all the ills of the world only to be invaded in her own home by poisoned water, 204, 242
At every meal every bath every turn—for nearly two years, 242, 252
She spoke with another mom who is now running to doctors appointments while trying to help others who are even worse off than she is." "And no one could overlook the 6-year-old in the room Jaylon, 252, 288
Hes the same age as my own son so his presence touched me personally, 288, 302
Jaylon loved taking pictures and he spent the meeting snapping photos on his phone.?" "It was hard for us to hear Jaylons mom say how much she loved him and how difficult it was for him without help at school, 302, 342
It was hard for Jaylon to hear too, 342, 350
While his mom talked he hid behind his phone, 350, 359
But when she was done Jaylon peeked up and smiled at us, 359, 371
It made us all laugh—and we needed that." When Jaylon was done taking pictures we headed to the sanctuary—a room full of love prayer and cheers, 371, 397
Pastor Stewart welcomed Hillary to the pulpit and she began: "This is the day the Lord has made .., 397, 416
" "Hillary cares about all of our families and neighbors, 416, 426
Thats why she assured the citys estimated 1000 undocumented immigrants that they wouldnt be left out, 426, 442
And thats why she finished her speech with this:" Before saying goodbye Hillary found Jaylon and his mother, 442, 460
Jaylon asked Barb Kinney our campaign photographer if he could try out her camera, 460, 474
She obliged, 474, 476
"With Hillarys leadership we can work together and get Flint back on its feet, 476, 490
And if we do I have no doubt that Jaylons grit and charm will take care of the rest." Jaylon takes a photo of Barb Kinney the official campaign photographer, 490, 520
