Thank you, 0, 2
In 22 days we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House, 2, 23
Early voting is underway so make sure to send in your absentee ballots, 23, 36
Together we are going to deliver real change that puts America First, 36, 48
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes and regulations lift the restrictions on American energy end common core and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare, 48, 91
"Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration, 91, 100
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration, 100, 109
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration, 109, 119
Your companies wont be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration." We are also going to end government corruption, 119, 137
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President, 137, 149
"Newly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes, 149, 162
The under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillarys illegal server, 162, 178
In other words the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillarys crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification." "This is a criminal conspiracy – a conspiracy that included Hillarys deleting and bleaching of 33000 emails the disappearance of 13 phones 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI." Remember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever and pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified, 178, 286
Hillary then told the FBI she couldnt remember 39 times and then in written testimony last week under oath said she couldnt remember another 21 times, 286, 312
"We are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clintons personal profit at your expense." But it gets even worse, 312, 339
The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a "quid pro quo." This is felony corruption, 339, 366
Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign, 366, 371
"Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security your familys safety and your countrys safety as though it meant nothing at all." "This is magnitudes worse than Watergate, 371, 397
And were going to put an end to it on November 8th." But theres still more, 397, 413
Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists, 413, 434
One of the emails from a top Hillary official said quote "take the money!!" with two exclamation points, 434, 452
This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments, 452, 466
Remember we are competing in a rigged election – the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news only to poison the minds of the American voters, 466, 508
The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign as WikiLeaks proved – Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate, 508, 534
A new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton, 534, 561
They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common, 561, 587
The following comes straight from Pew Research, 587, 594
QUOTE: "Approximately 24 million—one of every eight—voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate." QUOTE: "More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters." QUOTE: "Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state." Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting, 594, 646
The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post, 646, 657
The article was entitled: "could non-citizens decide the November election?" Here are some excerpts, 657, 671
QUOTE: "More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote." QUOTE: "Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample) we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections, 671, 733
Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress, 733, 763
It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obamas 2008 victory in North Carolina, 763, 779
Obama won the state by 14177 votes so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolinas adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin." "Our system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clintons campaign." The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA or the Trans-Pacific Partnership and for completely open borders is because her international donors control her every move, 779, 844
If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence, 844, 865
We will not let that happen, 865, 871
It is time to drain the swamp in Washington D.C, 871, 881
That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again, 881, 899
"When Bill Clinton came into office he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency you cant lobby the government for 5 years after you leave, 899, 933
But then President Clinton did what the Clintons always do – he rigged the system on his way out, 933, 952
Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash." So here is what I am announcing tonight, 952, 979
First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service, 979, 1004
I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order, 1004, 1025
Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs, 1025, 1048
Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists, 1048, 1082
Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, 1082, 1103
And Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections, 1103, 1128
Not only will we end our government corruption but we will end the economic stagnation, 1128, 1143
My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs jobs jobs, 1143, 1159
At the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, 1159, 1172
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps, 1172, 1186
We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 1186, 1209
"Its the Clintons who gave us NAFTA and the Clintons who gave us Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization." Briggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China, 1209, 1244
GE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico, 1244, 1257
Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China, 1257, 1275
The list goes on and on, 1275, 1281
We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 1281, 1295
A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA stand up to China and stop the jobs from leaving our country, 1295, 1315
As part of our plan to bring back our jobs we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent, 1315, 1339
We will be a rich nation once again, 1339, 1347
But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country, 1347, 1360
National Security begins at the border, 1360, 1366
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." By "open trade" she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars, 1366, 1405
By "open borders" she means totally unlimited immigration, 1405, 1413
In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs she said citizens who want to control immigration are "Un-American." So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable irredeemable un-American racist or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders, 1413, 1449
"Hillarys plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores." "So let me state this as clearly as I can, 1449, 1482
If Im elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country." We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration, 1482, 1507
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders, 1507, 1516
And yes we will build a wall, 1516, 1523
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, 1523, 1535
"As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldnt take them back." The ICE officers described Hillarys proposal as quote the most radical immigration proposal in U.S, 1535, 1572
history." Here is a summary of the Hillary plan: --Support for Sanctuary Cities --Social Security Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens --Obamacare for illegal immigrants --No deportation of visa overstays --Expanding catch-and-release on the border "--Expanding President Obamas unconstitutional executive amnesty including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers" "--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obamas non-enforcement directives" --A 550% increase in Syrian refugees Either we win this election or we lose the country, 1572, 1654
"Under a Trump Administration its going to be America First." Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1654, 1754
You have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true, 1754, 1771
On November 8th the arrogance of Washington D.C, 1771, 1779
will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 1779, 1792
I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation, 1792, 1809
"Im going to fight for every child living in poverty, 1809, 1819
Im going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence." "Im going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries." "Im going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors." And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1819, 1892
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1892, 1913
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 1913, 1927
Youre going to remember this day, 1927, 1933
This is a movement like youve never seen before, 1933, 1942
Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote youve ever cast for anyone at any time." Once again we are going to have a government of by and for the people, 1942, 1983
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 1983, 1989
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1989, 1995
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1995, 2001
And We Will Make America Great Again, 2001, 2008
