Hello Dade City! "I am so excited about being here, 0, 10
Thank you all for this really warm wonderful welcome, 10, 19
And I thank on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us, 19, 44
Alicia will be voting for the very first time in this election and I am very grateful for her support, 44, 64
Im also delighted that were joined today by your great senator Bill Nelson and his wife Grace." I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House Michael Cox chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce Michael Ledbetter who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly, 64, 119
And thanks to retired Colonel Wilson Elton   for his pledge of allegiance, 119, 131
And thanks to all the elected officials here, 131, 139
And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week! "Its almost hard to believe isnt it? There are only seven days left in this election." So are you ready to vote? Are you ready to volunteer these last seven days? "I hope too that you ready to elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate! Patrick whos been in Congress will be an independent voice for Florida families, 139, 224
And I am so excited to think about what he could do because unlike his opponent hes never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump." "Now somebody asked me the other day Why do you keep coming back to Florida? Just look around folks, 224, 269
I mean it is a beautiful and I have lots of friends but its also really important in this election, 269, 289
Florida can decide who our next president is which will affect the nation and the world, 289, 305
And I want to make sure that every voter in Florida spends these next seven days thinking about whats at stake in this election, 305, 329
Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes." "One week from today we will be choosing our next president and commander-in-chief of the United States, 329, 360
I dont think the choice could be any clearer, 360, 369
I have spent my career fighting for children and families, 369, 379
I have served in the United States Senate served on the Senate Armed Services Committee, 379, 394
I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice, 394, 408
I represented you as your secretary of state going to 112 countries negotiating with friend and foe alike, 408, 426
I am ready to serve if you give me the great honor of being your president." Now I do have to say that I think that stands in contrast to my opponent, 426, 458
And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons, 458, 485
"When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons he said Well then why are we making them?" "And I have to tell you yesterday I was in Ohio and I was introduced by a gentleman who was one of our officers in charge of launching nuclear weapons if the order ever came from our president, 485, 551
And what he told the crowd — it was a big crowd at Kent State University — I think every voter should hear, 551, 574
Basically — his name was Bruce Blair — he said that having had the responsibility of sitting in a bunker being responsible for the codes and the keys to our nuclear weapons he knows that when a president makes the order to launch a nuclear attack there is no appeal, 574, 624
There is no veto, 624, 628
And that is why he has joined with dozens of former Air Force officers to send a letter to say We need a president with the temperament the steadiness the calmness to be in charge of nuclear weapons, 628, 666
And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities." So when you think about voting early this week voting next Tuesday responsibility for our nuclear weapons is on the ballot, 666, 709
"So is immigration, 709, 712
Do we want to round up millions of people who are here working raising their families as he has suggested he will do? I dont think so, 712, 739
I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they cant be exploited by employers like Donald Trump who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less, 739, 778
I dont think thats right." Now maybe for some of you what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war, 778, 823
We need a Commander in Chief who respects the service and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform, 823, 844
"Or maybe for some of you its what he said about a judge born in Indiana who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University, 844, 879
And so Trump said Well we cant trust him because his parents were born in Mexico, 879, 895
Now Paul Ryan the Republican Speaker of the House called — well but wait a minute — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge The definition of a racist comment." And then Trump went on to attack a Gold Star family whose son Captain Khan died defending our country simply because that family was Muslim, 895, 953
"And then lets not forget Trump spent years years insisting that President Obama was not born in the United States even after the birth certificate was produced, 953, 980
Honestly if this were something new I think wed all be asking ourselves Well what does he have against President Obama? Or what does he have against me? But this is not new, 980, 1013
I know Im reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans." "And heres what I want you to tell, 1013, 1044
I want you to tell your Republican friends in 1987 Donald Trump took out a Donald Trump took out a $100000 ad in the New York Times to criticize President Reagan, 1044, 1075
He said Our leaders are the laughing stock of the world, 1075, 1086
So this is a man who thinks that he is better than President Reagan better than President Obama – literally better than anybody I guess, 1086, 1111
And when you think about it what he said at the convention I alone can fix it runs counter to who we are as Americans, 1111, 1136
We work together." "So there are many reasons why I think it is fair to conclude that Donald Trump is unqualified and unfit to be president, 1136, 1162
But today I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates? I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States, 1162, 1225
And during those debates Donald always used to say What have you been doing for 30 years? And I always found that kind of odd because he could Google it and find out, 1225, 1258
And so Ive been a lawyer and Ive been a first lady and Ive been a senator and Ive been Secretary of State and Ive been a wife and a mother and a grandmother and a friend and a churchgoer and for my entire life Ive been a woman." "And when I think about what we now know about Donald Trump and what hes been doing for 30 years he sure has spent a lot of time demeaning degrading insulting and assaulting women, 1258, 1341
And Ive got to tell you some of what weve learned – some of this stuff is very upsetting, 1341, 1360
I would frankly rather be here talking about nearly anything else like how were going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top, 1360, 1392
How were going to make college affordable for every single family because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125000 you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university, 1392, 1429
And if youre above that it will be debt free and we will help you pay back the debt you already have so you can get out from under it." "But I cant just talk about all of the good things we want to do because people are making up their minds, 1429, 1481
This is a consequential choice so weve got to talk about something that frankly is painful because it matters, 1481, 1500
We cant just wish it away, 1500, 1506
And a lot of his supporters dont like to hear this, 1506, 1517
I dont blame them, 1517, 1521
If I were supporting him I wouldnt want to hear it either to be honest, 1521, 1536
But Ive got to tell you I learned way back in elementary school and I learned it in Sunday school: its not okay to insult people, 1536, 1562
Its not okay." "And look at what he does, 1562, 1571
He calls women ugly disgusting nasty all the time, 1571, 1580
He calls women pigs rates bodies on a scale from 1 to 10, 1580, 1593
We just heard from Alicia, 1593, 1598
She was Miss Universe when Donald Trump owned the pageant, 1598, 1608
Well he said she put on some weight and it made him angry so he called her Miss Piggy, 1608, 1627
He called her Miss Housekeeping because shes a beautiful Latina, 1627, 1637
He brought a bunch of reporters to a gym to watch him order her around to exercise, 1637, 1654
Now he also said This is somebody who likes to eat, 1654, 1665
Well I have to say: who doesnt like to eat? I mean really can we just stop for a minute and reflect on the absurdity of Donald Trump finding fault with Miss Universe?" "But youve got to ask: why does he do these things? Who acts like this? And Ill tell you who: a bully thats who, 1665, 1722
And thankfully Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down, 1722, 1735
She knows that Donald Trump doesnt get to decide her value in her eyes and in the eyes of her family and her friends." "But what about our girls? What about girls watching all this? What happens to their confidence their sense of self-worth? If youve got a daughter a granddaughter a sister a mother a wife a good friend someone like this becoming president who insults more than half the population of the United States of America? And what about our boys? This is not someone we want them looking up to." "Not so long ago I was the mother of a teenage girl, 1735, 1840
And every day I tried to make sure that she knew she was smart and she was capable and Im doing the same thing with my granddaughter and my grandson, 1840, 1870
Because lets be honest here the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they dont look right theyre not thin enough they dont act right no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy or whatever the criticism might be, 1870, 1924
Right?" "And I remember when Chelsea was a teenager I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall thats there for her to come home from school, 1924, 1957
And sometimes we only had a few minutes together, 1957, 1966
But before shed run off to talk to her friends or do whatever she was planning to I would figure out how was the day, 1966, 1991
Wed talk about what was on her mind, 1991, 1999
And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent because we parents and I know there are a lot of parents here today we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value and it really is important that we dont let anybody take that away from them, 1999, 2063
And we want them to be strong and we dont want them to feel bad about themselves, 2063, 2080
And weve got to work hard to make sure our boys just like our girls have that same sense of positive energy: not negative not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women." "In fact all of us should respect each other in our country, 2080, 2127
So when I look at my granddaughter and my grandson I am on the same mission, 2127, 2143
I want them to know theyre love theyre cared for theyre respected, 2143, 2155
I want them to develop a good work ethic, 2155, 2164
I believe in hard work and I want them to go out and prove themselves in the world, 2164, 2182
But thats what I want for every child, 2182, 2190
I have spent my life doing everything I could to help kids and families, 2190, 2204
It will be the mission of my presidency, 2204, 2212
I will get up every day in the White House trying to figure out: how can we knock down the barriers overcome the challenges so that people living here in Pasco County can get ahead and stay ahead?" "So I know theres work to be done, 2212, 2258
We cant do it with just words alone, 2258, 2266
Weve got to do more to stop treatment about women being somehow objectified, 2266, 2279
And oh my gosh when we heard that tape and we heard what he does to women, 2279, 2296
Im not going to repeat it, 2296, 2302
But you know what Donald Trump was bragging about: grabbing women mistreating women, 2302, 2315
And I have to tell you since that tape came out twelve women have come to say that What he said on that tape is what he did to me." "And then we heard his response, 2315, 2351
What he does at his rallies is to go after those women all over again insulting them, 2351, 2368
He said he couldnt possibly have said those things because the women werent attractive enough to assault, 2368, 2385
Look at her he said about one woman, 2385, 2393
I dont think so, 2393, 2397
About another he said She wouldnt be my first choice." "Hes also on tape bragging with the radio personality Howard Stern about how he used to go backstage at beauty pageants to barge in on the women while they were getting dressed, 2397, 2439
He said he did that — he said he did that to inspect them, 2439, 2453
That was his word – and he said I sort of get away with things like that, 2453, 2470
And sure enough contestants have come forward to say Yes thats exactly what he did to us, 2470, 2487
Now as bad as that is he didnt just do it at the Miss USA pageant or the Miss Universe pageant, 2487, 2508
Hes also been accused of doing it at the Miss Teen USA pageant, 2508, 2521
Contestants say that Donald Trump came in to look at them when they were changing, 2521, 2536
Some of them were just 15 years old." "We cannot hide from this, 2536, 2549
Weve got to be willing to face it, 2549, 2557
This man wants to be president of the United States of America and our First Lady Michelle Obama spoke for many of us when she said Donald Trumps words have shaken her to her core." "For a lot of women who have gone through something like this in your lives thats brought back painful memories, 2557, 2612
And for men who would never ever talk or act like Donald its been shocking to see this, 2612, 2630
He tried to explain it away as locker room talk well Ill tell you what a lot of professional athletes stood up and said Not in our locker rooms, 2630, 2659
That does not happen." Well I guess the bottom line is he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man, 2659, 2679
"And I dont think theres a woman anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like." "He doesnt look at us and see full human beings with our dreams and purposes our own capabilities, 2679, 2712
And he has shown us that clearly throughout this campaign." "Well hes very wrong, 2712, 2726
He is wrong about both the women and the men of this country, 2726, 2739
He has shown us who he is, 2739, 2746
Let us on Tuesday show him who we are, 2746, 2755
We can stand up for what we believe what we want for our children and grandchildren what we know is right, 2755, 2776
And you can go down the list of everything he has said, 2776, 2788
He doesnt believe in equal pay he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience he wont raise the minimum wage and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table he gets angry, 2788, 2823
Instead of supporting women who are out there supporting their families he wants to make it even harder." "Well I have a message for him, 2823, 2848
Were going to fight for affordable childcare, 2848, 2855
Were going to fight for equal pay for all people, 2855, 2865
Were going to fight for paid family leave were going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and thats important because so many people still struggling still working hard raising a family having a hard time getting all of their bills paid, 2865, 2911
And thats especially true for minimum wage workers — who — two-thirds of whom are women so weve got work to do my friends, 2911, 2935
Im excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you I will work for you I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be, 2935, 2976
Because instead of Donald Trumps dangerous and divisive vision mine is positive optimistic hopeful and unifying." "But I cant do any of this without your help, 2976, 3002
Early voting has already begun, 3002, 3007
Almost 26 millions Americans have already voted and that includes four million right here in Florida, 3007, 3023
Americans are voting for the kind of better future we can make together, 3023, 3036
And voting on all the issues that they care about, 3036, 3046
It may be my name and Donalds name on the ballot but everything you care about our security our economy bringing our country together the environment clean water and clean air!" Here in Dade City you can vote every day from now until November 5th from 7am to 7pm, 3046, 3095
"In fact right now the East Pasco Government Center is just a few minutes drive away, 3095, 3111
You can go there right after this rally and vote, 3111, 3121
Because we need everybody to stand up in this election." And if you have a mail-in ballot at home send it in when you get home today, 3121, 3148
"Dont wait to send it back! Talk friends and family and neighbors and co-workers." "Donald Trumps strategy is pretty simple– he said he wants to suppress young people from voting women from voting people of color from voting that is a lot of people, 3148, 3192
By showing up with the biggest turnout ever we will show him and everybody a message that that is not who we are." "Now I know here in this county and this larger region you probably know some people who are going to vote for Trump, 3192, 3238
And here is what I want to ask you I want you to talk with them, 3238, 3254
Ask them what they care about, 3254, 3260
Ask them what kind of future they want for their economy, 3260, 3271
Because Donald Trumps economic plan is slashing taxes on the wealthy and big corporations, 3271, 3285
I have said that I want the wealthy to pay their fair share and I will not raise taxes on anybody making less than $250000 a year." So there could not be no matter what you care about a bigger difference between me and Donald Trump and I hope that you will come out and volunteer for these last seven days, 3285, 3346
We are signing up for volunteer shifts making calls knocking on doors it really matters turn out matters, 3346, 3364
Please go to hillaryclinton.com to see how you can get involved, 3364, 3375
Here is what I want to leave you with, 3375, 3384
You know I feel like so many of you our country is already great but we can make is greater, 3384, 3404
The main reason America is great is because America is good, 3404, 3415
We are a big hearted generous people, 3415, 3422
Not a small minded people, 3422, 3427
We know that if everybody works together we will get farther together than if we separate people we push them down we engage in all the negativity that we have heard too much in this campaign, 3427, 3463
But sometimes the fate of even the greatest nations lie in the balance, 3463, 3476
For America this is one of those make or break elections, 3476, 3487
It really is in your hands, 3487, 3493
I hope you will think about how you will feel the day after the election on November 9th, 3493, 3511
are we going to more forward together or are we going to move backwards by someone who wants to bully us? And I hope I hope you will think about how together we can make a difference I want to be your partner as well as your president I want us to create the best possible future for our children and our grandchildren, 3511, 3574
That is what I will work my heart out to do and I hope you will help me to make a better fairer stronger America, 3574, 3599
Where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate! Thank you all, 3599, 3613
