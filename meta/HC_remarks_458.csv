Thank you so much wow it is great to be here.n And thank you, 0, 14
I am so honored to be introduced by Mae Wiggins and someone who made such a contribution throughout her life as a nurse to so many people and who as you can tell just feels still the pain of being rejected on the basis of her race.n It took a lot of courage to come here Mae, 14, 71
Thank you, 71, 73
Thank you for being with us.n "I also want to thank a long-time friend of mine a great activist extraordinary advocate in Congress and thats U.S, 73, 99
Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, 99, 103
I want to thank Mayor Allen Thomas for welcoming me here, 103, 114
And either youre all related to him or you think hes doing a good job.n" Well I told him I want to be a good partner with mayors like him, 114, 144
And work to help communities like Greenville that are growing and striving and attracting young people, 144, 160
He told me that the average age in the residents here in Greenville was 26 years old.n I also want to acknowledge Josh Stein candidate for North Carolina attorney general, 160, 190
Patsy Keever chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party, 190, 199
And State Senator Don Davis.n And I saved the best for last someone who Ive gotten to know over the years; someone who I really look forward to working with, 199, 229
First thing that Congressman Butterfield said to me is "I have to talk to you about our farmers." Very first thing he said, 229, 252
Proceeded to tell me that he was out on a 200-acre sweet potato farm earlier today, 252, 268
We talked about the damage that Hurricane Matthew has done; the lives lost; the homes lost; and also the agricultural damage with all the flooding, 268, 293
And my heart goes out to everyone who has been affected, 293, 304
Weve got to be really focused on what were going to do with this extreme weather, 304, 320
Were getting more of it in more places, 320, 328
And Im going to make that a priority for my presidency to make sure communities are well prepared, 328, 346
Theyre resilient, 346, 348
But that we also work to try to limit the damage by taking on the challenge of climate change and changing weather patterns.n "And nobody knows more about weather than our farmers, 348, 380
And I am very committed to supporting farms of all sizes but particularly small farms, 380, 395
You know I think you said the farm you went to this morning G.K, 395, 409
was 200 acres, 409, 412
You know thats a lot of land but thats not a gigantic multi-thousand-acre farm, 412, 426
And sometimes I think that we spend too much time and money looking after the big giant farms and not enough taking care of the smaller farms the family-owned farms farms that have been in peoples families for generations.n" "And I will do my very best working with G.K, 426, 475
and Eleanor and others in Congress to focus federal attention and resources on places that need it, 475, 492
And eastern North Carolina is a place that needs it, 492, 502
There are still too many people who feel like they have been left out and left behind, 502, 519
And so weve got to spend time thinking about how we bring everybody along.n" "That is my goal as your president, 519, 540
I want to knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people and places getting ahead, 540, 558
Now also on a personal note I was in Arizona last night and had a great rally there, 558, 576
I dont know -- 15000 16000 people, 576, 583
It was just extraordinary, 583, 587
But I was a little anxious during my speech because the Cubs were playing in the World Series.n" "And you know Ive been a fan all my life; started watching baseball with my dad; went to Wrigley Field, 587, 625
And you know its been a long time 108 years to win a championship and make history, 625, 642
And I only wish that my late father and the great Ernie Banks Mr, 642, 656
Cub could have seen it happen, 656, 662
So last night was very special on lots of fronts, 662, 672
And who knows? Maybe well see even more history made in a few days, 672, 686
You know the last time the Cubs won women couldnt vote, 686, 697
And I think women are making up for that in this election.n" So thank you, 697, 712
Thank you so much for being here, 712, 719
Are you ready to vote? How many -- how many folks have already voted?  n "Well thats really impressive, 719, 738
Are you ready to volunteer these last few days? Are you ready to elect Ray Cooper your governor? Have a governor who puts families first and your needs, 738, 766
I know hell do a terrific job.n" "Are you ready to elect Deborah Ross to the United States Senate? She will be the independent voice that North Carolina families deserve, 766, 796
And unlike her opponent shes never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump, 796, 810
And then are you ready to elect our next president and commander in chief?n" You know did any of you -- any of you see those debates? Well you know I spent four-and-a-half hours standing next to Donald Trump proving conclusively I have the stamina to be the next president and commander in chief.n But you know he kept saying things like "Well you know what have you done for 30 years?" Well we know what hes done for 30 years starting with discriminating against African Americans and denying them housing back in the 1970s.n I chose a different path, 810, 910
I have spent my career fighting for kids and families, 910, 920
And I helped to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program as first lady, 920, 933
That now provides healthcare to 8 million children a year, 933, 943
And I have to tell you I know it doesnt make headlines, 943, 955
Its not going to you know get a big Twitter war going but when I travel around and shake hands like Ill do after my remarks and somebody says to me "The Childrens Health Insurance Program saved my sons life." I met a woman here in North Carolina whose daughter was born deaf, 955, 1008
And the doctor said "You know shes never ever going to be able to talk; shes not ever going to be able to hear." Her mother who is determined began doing investigations; she found out that there were some possible treatments, 1008, 1049
But they were expensive, 1049, 1053
She didnt know what she was going to do, 1053, 1062
And she took her daughter to the doctor and the doctor said "I just heard about this new program the childrens health insurance program, 1062, 1086
Maybe you can qualify for that."n "Because its really for families that arent poor but dont have much money and a lot of families isnt it, 1086, 1112
And families that dont have an employer that provides health insurance self employed independent contractors.n" "So the mom found out about this thing call the childrens health program and low and behold they did qualify and they started the treatments for their daughter, 1112, 1155
I met that young woman and she said hello to me and she talked to me, 1155, 1171
She just graduated from college right here in North Carolina, 1171, 1181
So dont let anybody tell you it doesnt matter what you stand for what you fight for and who you are trying to help, 1181, 1205
When you make your decision about who to vote for in this election.n" As a Senator from New York I worked to rebuild New York City after the 9/11 attacks and to provide healthcare to the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it, 1205, 1252
And many of themâ€”n   n " Where you there? God bless you, 1252, 1264
Thats another thing I meet people all over who were there and who worked there and I meet people who got sick because they worked there, 1264, 1290
And as your Secretary of State I traveled to 112 countries negotiated cease fires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and womens right and LGBT rights around the world.n" And everything Ive done its because Ive been listening to people and again I know thats not very exciting, 1290, 1343
I plead to that, 1343, 1347
You spend time listening not talking you know what are the poor journalists going to say "Uh there Hillary Clinton was listening again" right?n "But Ill tell you it is what motivates me to hear peoples stories to hear the tribulations and triumphs, 1347, 1390
You get good ideas, 1390, 1394
Bring people together; find common ground even with people we disagree with, 1394, 1406
I disagree with people on lots of issues but I believe the only way we can get things done is to actually listen and respect each other and try to find common that common ground, 1406, 1441
And that will enable us to get results for people, 1441, 1451
And if you elect me next Tuesday that is the kind of President Ill be.n" "And from the first day of this campaign Ive been telling you what I want to do, 1451, 1483
Putting forth my ideas about what I think will help you, 1483, 1494
I truly believe that you deserve a candidate that you can vote for not just someone to vote against, 1494, 1513
And so if we are gonna make this choice we have got to be clear, 1513, 1528
The positives and the negatives because one way or the other come this January America is going to have a new President, 1528, 1550
And it will be either me or Donald Trump.n" "And you know what else? People say all the time you know I want change will come that is certain, 1550, 1579
The question is what kind of change are we going to have, 1579, 1591
Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices our discrimination that stops us from coming together? So here is what I want you to do in these next days as you talk with people who maybe havent yet voted maybe havent yet made up their mind, 1591, 1665
I want you to ask them imagine it is January 20th 2017 and it is Donald Trump standing in front of the capital taking the Oath of Office.n" "Imagine what that will be like to have him in the Oval Office making the decisions that effect your lives and your futures, 1665, 1716
Imagine having a president who demeans women mocks the disabled insults African Americans and Latinos, 1716, 1731
Who pits people against each other instead of pulling them together, 1731, 1742
Someone who always puts himself first and doesnt care who gets hurt along the wayn" "A president with a very thin skin who lashes out at anyone who challenges him, 1742, 1772
Who praises adversaries like Vladimir Putin and picks fights with our allies and even attacked the Pope, 1772, 1789
The truth is we dont have to imagine what that would be like because everything that Donald Trump has said and done both in his career and in his campaign is a preview of what could happen.n" You know as Michelle Obama says the presidency doesnt change who you are it reveals who you are, 1789, 1844
And we have all see all we need of Donald Trump, 1844, 1855
If Donald Trump were to win this election we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous, 1855, 1883
Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war, 1883, 1911
And yet this morning in Florida Donald stood on a stage and said and I quote "I am honored to have the greatest temperament that anyone has ever had", 1911, 1940
Now -- he knows we can see and hear him right?n "This is someone who at another rally yesterday actually said out loud to himself stay on point Donald Stay on point, 1940, 1972
His campaign probably put that in the teleprompters stay on point Donald stay on point, 1972, 1987
You know we have seen it over and over again, 1987, 1997
We know his true self, 1997, 2002
His instinct is to say whatever pops into his head no matter how wrong he is, 2002, 2018
He cant help himself, 2018, 2022
So is this someone we want to put in charge of our military?n" Is this someone that we want to treat people the way he has demonstrated his disrespect throughout this campaign, 2022, 2054
In a country that values religious liberty and freedom, 2054, 2063
Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country, 2063, 2078
Someone who thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair, 2078, 2093
He has no idea none about the strength of the black church the vibrancy of black owned businesses the excellence of historically black colleges and universities the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field, 2093, 2140
Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins, 2140, 2149
And Mae wasnt alone, 2149, 2153
Whenever African Americans tried to rent an apartment their application was marked with a "C" -- "C" for colored.n "In fact Donald his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s, 2153, 2198
They settled the case but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color, 2198, 2222
Think about that, 2222, 2225
If he were to win he would be in charge of the federal housing department, 2225, 2240
If he doesnt respect all Americans how can we trust him to serve all Americans?n" And then another recent example is the way Donald Trump treated what are called the "Central Park Five." These were five black and Latino kids some as young as 14, 2240, 2285
Who it turns out were wrongly convicted of a terrible crime in New York back in 1990.n Donald Trump took out full-page ads in four newspapers calling for the death penalty for these kids, 2285, 2319
Nearly three decades later they were exonerated by DNA evidence, 2319, 2329
Also someone else confessed to the crime, 2329, 2336
So they were finally released from prison and justice was done but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution he actually said they should still be in prison.n To him those kids will still and always be guilty no matter what the evidence says, 2336, 2386
Do we want this man appointing judges? Do we want him controlling the Justice Department?n  No!n " Well people who are voting for him thats what they would get, 2386, 2415
He has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters, 2415, 2430
He retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories, 2430, 2440
And you better believe hes being heard loudly and clearly.n" Just a few days ago and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party, 2440, 2478
Just a few days ago Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan.n They wrote their endorsement under the slogan of his campaign "Make America Great Again." They said its about preserving white identity, 2478, 2517
And they placed their faith and hope in him, 2517, 2526
Youve got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution who believe in the rule of law who believe that we are stronger together who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trumps America?n "Its not just about communities of color, 2526, 2597
Its about young people, 2597, 2601
Its about any of us who dont ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated, 2601, 2627
That is not who America is and were not going to let it ever go back to that.n" "But it doesnt end there, 2627, 2650
Youve also got to ask: Do women and girls have a place either? Imagine our daughters or in my case now my granddaughter growing up with someone who ranks women by their looks; gives them numbers and brags about doing things to them without their consent, 2650, 2696
Just imagine what that would mean to young womens confidence and self-worth, 2696, 2708
And how that will affect our young men and boys who we want to teach and nurture also to respect each other and respect girls and women as well.n" "So this is a pretty clear choice North Carolina, 2708, 2746
Ive said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is, 2746, 2762
Now we have to decide who we are, 2762, 2770
Right?n" "And across America people are doing just that -- rejecting Trumps dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful inclusive and unifying, 2770, 2796
We know that America is big-hearted not small-minded, 2796, 2804
We want to lift people up not tear people down.n" "We are called -- we are called, 2804, 2821
In fact we are commanded those of us who are Christians to love our neighbor as ourselves arent we? We are not asked we are not requested we are not urged -- we are commanded, 2821, 2856
And we know how hard that is, 2856, 2863
When I used to teach Sunday School I often taught on that not because it was well known but because I think its so hard and challenging.n" "Love your neighbor as yourself? Well first youve got to love yourself, 2863, 2902
Youve got to respect yourself, 2902, 2907
And then you have to love your neighbor as yourself, 2907, 2917
I believe with all my heart that we are better than this, 2917, 2929
And thats why I want to paint a different picture, 2929, 2939
Because heres what were going to do if we win this election, 2939, 2951
Were going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow through.n" We are not going to accept the status quo, 2951, 2975
What happened to that church in Mississippi yesterday should not be normal, 2975, 2987
People painted "vote Trump" on the side, 2987, 2994
And then they set it on fire, 2994, 3001
Who would do that to a house of worship? In America that can never be acceptable, 3001, 3017
What happened in Flint Michigan should not be normal or acceptable -- little babies toddlers children drinking water that was poisoning them, 3017, 3039
And there are too many young African Americans who are dying either in police incidents or from random gun violence, 3039, 3059
You know their names: Trayvon Martin Eric Garner Sander Bland Key Scott, 3059, 3071
So many, 3071, 3073
We cant accept that as normal either.n "So we are going to get to work, 3073, 3088
Im just telling you, 3088, 3092
If Im fortunate enough to be your president were going to roll up our sleeves and get to work because thats when were at our best solving our problems.n" "Were going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with a cradle-to-career pipeline for every child in this country, 3092, 3142
I want to make sure that our kids have the chance to thrive with good schools and good teachers no matter what ZIP code they live in.n" We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end, 3142, 3180
It is wrong, 3180, 3183
And I dont care whether you are black or white, 3183, 3193
It is wrong that black men are far more likely to be stopped by police charged and sentenced to longer prison terms than white men for the same crimes, 3193, 3222
Its wrong and were going to do something about that, 3222, 3232
And Donald Trump whenever hes face with these issues says "well the answer to our problems is more law and order." He doesnt tell you what he means by that but its kind of code for fear and division, 3232, 3271
What I think we need to do is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities.n I think we are all safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law, 3271, 3311
And its not all we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives because right now weve got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill felons domestic abusers terrorists, 3311, 3352
You know we cant just bow down and say theres nothing we can do commensurate with the second amendment, 3352, 3371
Donalds always trying to say "oh you know shes going to repeal the second amendment." What nonsense, 3371, 3388
Absolute nonsense, 3388, 3390
But I believe we can respect and honor the second amendment and keep people safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands.n "And were going to make significant investments in communities that have been let down and left behind, 3390, 3430
Congressman Butterfield and I were talking about this, 3430, 3438
Theres some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities white black Latino Native American wherever they might be that have been left out, 3438, 3463
We need to get the engine of economic growth going because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top, 3463, 3492
We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind, 3492, 3517
And I think not only do Americans deserve a raise which Donald doesnt agree with and wanted to eliminate the national minimum wage I think its finally time for women to get equal pay for the work we do.n" "I dont know about you but this is not just a womens issue, 3517, 3569
Im always accused by Donald and his supporters that whenever I talk like that Im playing the womans card, 3569, 3588
Well Ive always said if thats playing the womans card deal me in you got that right.n" "But I actually think Im playing the family economics card because if you have a mother a wife a sister or a daughter she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force.n" "And were going to have a big investments in new jobs infrastructure jobs our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems, 3588, 3668
And were going to do more to bring advanced manufacturing to inner cities and rural communities, 3668, 3684
Put people to work doing work that has a really productive purpose, 3684, 3696
Were going to invest in more clean renewable energy jobs these are jobs that cannot be exported they have to be done right here in eastern North Carolina.n" Now its fair to say "Ok that sounds good how are you going to do all that?" Ok Ill tell you two things, 3696, 3747
First I have said and you can hold me to it I will not - will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $25000 a year, 3747, 3774
You see I come from the middle class, 3774, 3782
My dad never made anything near that even in those dollars back in those days, 3782, 3797
But I know that the best way to grow our economy is from the middle out and the bottom up, 3797, 3817
Not the top down that does not work for most Americans, 3817, 3828
And so secondly Im going where the money is, 3828, 3837
The money has gone to the wealthiest of Americans and big corporations in the last 15 years, 3837, 3854
And if you ask Donald Trump what is his economic policy? It is to give trillions - trillions of dollars in tax cuts to himself to his family to the wealthy to corporations, 3854, 3887
I just think thats a bad bad idea.n "Were going to make the wealthy pay their fair share and were going to make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again, 3887, 3918
And were going to make public colleges like East Carolina University tuition-free, 3918, 3930
Tuition-free for working and middle class families and debt free for everybody else, 3930, 3943
And if youre struggling with student debt we have a plan to ease that burden and cut your bills and get you out from under debt, 3943, 3969
And were going to create $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities.n" "But I dont think that every young person needs to go college, 3969, 3998
If you want to Im going to make it affordable for you but if you also want some other way of making a good living lets bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships.n" "There is such a stark difference on every issue that matters between me and my opponent and Im asking folks who are still making up their minds to really search your heart about what kind of country we are and what kind of future we want, 3998, 4087
I just dont believe were at our best when we stoke fear about each other, 4087, 4102
Now that does not mean we have to agree about everything of course not, 4102, 4116
But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society.n" "I dont think I have all the answers I dont think anybody does, 4116, 4155
When Donald Trump at his conventions said he alone could fix everything in America I thought about our founders meeting in Philadelphia, 4155, 4177
It wasnt one person creating our country it was many people working together, 4177, 4190
Think about every social movement every economic advance every university like this one every achievement that youve made in your own life somebody helped you, 4190, 4215
You worked with somebody, 4215, 4219
Look at this community, 4219, 4223
Everybody working together making Greenville really grow and thrive making this university better and better every single year, 4223, 4241
That is my experience of America so heres what I hope you will do, 4241, 4255
I hope you will get everybody you know and yourselves  if you havent voted yet to vote early, 4255, 4273
Because the others strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls, 4273, 4289
Now Donald Trumps campaign knows that if women turn out if people of color turn out if young people turn out if people who share our vision of a positive unified country turnout theres no way he can win because that is more than half the people in America.n" "You may have noticed that President Obama was in Chapel Hill yesterday, 4289, 4350
Hes coming back to North Carolina tomorrow because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington, 4350, 4370
As he said yesterday everything weve done is dependent on him being to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things he does, 4370, 4396
Well Ill tell you what Im ready to grab that baton, 4396, 4407
Hes going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it because you know hes a tall man, 4407, 4429
But Ive been practicing, 4429, 4433
I spent four years working with him, 4433, 4440
I call him my partner and my friend and I am ready to defend and build on his progress coming out of his eight years of the presidency.n" "So lets get out and vote and lets vote for the kind of future that we want the kind of country that we want, 4440, 4492
Find your early voting location for the next three days please go take people there, 4492, 4507
We will show once and for all love trumps hate thank you all." , 4507, 4520
