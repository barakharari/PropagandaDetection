Campaigning is an art, 0, 4
" Theres nearly half a foot of fresh snow on the ground—and it just keeps coming down, 4, 21
The morning-drive DJs on local radio stations suggest staying indoors." "But step inside the YWCA and hundreds of Granite Staters are bustling about getting ready to start knocking on doors, 21, 51
There are just a few days left until the New Hampshire primary and a little snow wont keep them inside for long—notxa0when their candidate Hillary Clinton needs them to talk to as many voters as possible before Tuesdays election." As Joni a 74-year-old veteran volunteer says in between checking in fellow canvassers "This is nothing, 51, 106
This is just a light snowstorm, 106, 112
And its typical Hillary campaign behavior: Lets get this done lets do it right and lets win this election." "But if theres anyone in the crowd who needs a little extra motivation to go out and knock doors in a snowstorm they get it—in the form of a pep talk straight from the candidate (and " ), 112, 169
Hillary tells them: "You can tell people youre talking to today bring both their heart and their head, 169, 187
Bring them both Tuesday, 187, 191
And help us all begin to move toward making sure we have a Democratic president once again in the White House." After Hillary says goodbye the last selfie is taken and the television cameras power down the real work begins, 191, 231
The crowd inside the YWCA disperses across Manchester bringing their hearts and their heads their personal stories and their best arguments to their neighbors—whatever it takes to get the job done for Hillary next Tuesday, 231, 266
Everyone has their own reason for going out into the snow—here are four of them:  "I didnt realize how much passion I had until I started helping out on her campaign, 266, 297
She stands for what I believe in, 297, 304
Because of Hillary I got involved in the political process back in 2007, 304, 317
Because of her I kept on going—even after she didnt win the nomination, 317, 330
And I made a promise to her that its going to happen this time, 330, 344
I believe in her, 344, 348
Shes such a strong candidate and I want so badly for her to be our president."  "I flew back from Mumbai yesterday, 348, 370
I landed in Boston at 5:30 p.m, 370, 377
which was two hours later than planned, 377, 384
I was supposed to be canvassing during the 6 p.m, 384, 394
shift that night, 394, 397
So I called my organizer Katie from Logan Airport and told her the plane got in too late but I still wanted to start canvassing first thing today, 397, 425
It was my birthday and I really wanted to canvass for Hillary on my birthday."  "I was in a local orphanage in the 1950s when I was 5 years old, 425, 455
I didnt speak—I was too frightened, 455, 461
And when I grew up I found my voice, 461, 470
I found out Hillary had been an advocate for kids since she got out of school, 470, 486
That was the hook for me—she has never stopped fighting for children, 486, 498
She would have been my voice as a little girl, 498, 508
And now that Im retired its my time to be out there for her, 508, 522
I had this hat made just for the campaign, 522, 531
People ask me about it all the time and its my introduction to telling them about this very special woman named Hillary Clinton."  "When it comes down to it Hillary stands for fairness, 531, 564
As a woman she knows what its like to fight to be treated with the same respect as a man, 564, 584
Unions are all about being treated fairly and with respect, 584, 594
We can cut wood we can paint we can do electrical work, 594, 606
We can do all the things men can do—including being president." , 606, 617
