"Hello, 0, 1
Its so great to be back here with all of you tonight, 1, 13
I want to thank my friend Congressman Jim Clyburn; Don Peebles; Representative Butterfield; members of the Congressional Black Caucus; and congratulate all of the honorees, 13, 38
On a personal note I want to recognize a dear friend who is retiring after 46 years Congressman Charles Rangel, 38, 58
He is one of a kind and we are grateful for your years of service, 58, 73
"And what can I say about one of the best Presidents this country has ever had Barack Obama? All through this campaign I have made the point over and over again Presi-dent Obama saved our country from a second Great Depression, 73, 114
He brought Osama bin Laden to justice, 114, 121
And so much more, 121, 125
I for one dont think he gets the credit he deserves for doing what hes done on behalf of our country and the world, 125, 149
And its not just the President hes been but the man he is, 149, 162
Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way Barack Michelle their two beautiful daughters have represented our country with class grace and integrity, 162, 185
As Michelle says When others go low we go high, 185, 195
I know I speak for not just everyone in this room but so many tens of millions of Americans: Mr, 195, 215
President not only do we know you are an American youre a great American! And you make us all proud to be Americans too." Let me thank the leadership of the CBC Foundation for this great honor and to thank all of my friends in the Congressional Black Caucus for it as well, 215, 268
I dedicate it to all the trailblazers who came before me who blazed trails that I could follow in their footsteps â€“ Barbara Jordan, 268, 292
Shirley Chisholm, 292, 294
I would not be standing here without them, 294, 302
Generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and cleared a path for all of us, 302, 319
"This award is also for everyone out there helping to break down the barriers holding Americans back to leaders like all of you and to a rising generation of young activists, 319, 350
To all those on the front lines dedicated to the proposition that in America every single child deserves the chance to fulfill his or her God-given potential, 350, 377
This has been the cause of my life ever since I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund all those years ago, 377, 400
And Im going to close my campaign the way I began my career and the way that I will serve as your president focused on opportunities for our children and fairness for our families." "We have so much work to do together, 400, 442
Ive heard many heartbreaking stories over this campaign, 442, 450
One was from Tianna Gaines-Turner a working mother to three children from Northeast Philadelphia, 450, 464
She testified at the DNC platform meeting in June and told us how her husband had been laid off and she worked in a part-time job, 464, 490
She said shed been hungry more times than she could count and that life felt like a maze because she faced barriers no matter which way she turned, 490, 518
But despite all of this Tianna has hope, 518, 526
She still believes that her 8-year-old daughter will be president one day, 526, 538
And she believes that this election can make all the difference in the world to her and her family, 538, 557
Lets prove her right." "As a country we have a moral obligation to give her family and every family a chance to rise up and reach their dreams, 557, 585
That is whats at stake in this election, 585, 593
Its not about golf course promotions or birth certificate, 593, 602
It comes down to" who will fight for the forgotten who will invest in our children and who will really have your back in the White House, 602, 629
"We need ideas not insults real plans to help struggling Americans in communities that have been left out and left behind not prejudice and paranoia, 629, 654
We cant let Barack Obamas legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesnt understand that whose dangerous and divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards, 654, 682
Instead we need to come together to get incomes rising with a higher minimum wage to invest in neglected communities with efforts like Jim Clyburns 10-20-30 plan to get guns out of the hands of dangerous people to fight for a criminal justice system that actually delivers justice and to make sure that all kids have good schools and good teachers no matter what zip codes they live in." "When you really think about it the choice this November is about so much more than Democrats and Republicans, 682, 770
As Michelle Obama said at the Democratic convention its about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four years of their lives, 770, 797
Its also about the kind of country we want to be what we want to leave behind for future generations, 797, 817
I thank everyone here who has been fighting for this vision over so many years, 817, 832
I thank all who have supported me, 832, 839
I want you to know Im not taking your vote or anyones vote for granted, 839, 854
Im working every single day to earn your support, 854, 863
And I need your help over the next 52 days to bring our campaign across the finish line together." Barbara Jordan famously said that a government is invigorated when each of us is willing to participate in shaping the future of this nation, 863, 906
So to everyone here tonight please keep doing what youre doing but also help to register voters, 906, 923
Tell others about the clear choice in this election, 923, 932
In some states early voting is nearly here so we need to keep the pressure on, 932, 948
Lets send a loud and clear message once and for all: We are stronger together, 948, 963
And no matter what remember this: Love trumps hate, 963, 972
Thank you all very much!" , 972, 977
