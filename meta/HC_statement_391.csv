"Its chilling to learn that U.S, 0, 6
intelligence officials are conducting a probe into suspected meetings between Trumps foreign policy adviser Carter Page and members of Putins inner circle while in Moscow, 6, 31
You have to ask why he would meet with Igor Diveykin who is believed by U.S, 31, 47
officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S, 47, 60
election, 60, 61
This comes as Russian hackers continue their attempts to influence the outcome of our elections something Trump openly invited, 61, 80
This is serious business and voters deserve the facts before election day, 80, 92
"Just one day after we learned about Trumps hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed Russian business interests this report suggests Page met with a sanctioned top Russian official to discuss the possibility of ending U.S, 92, 128
sanctions against Russia under a Trump presidency – an action that could directly enrich both Trump and Page while undermining American interests, 128, 150
This is precisely what more than fifty national security experts warned against when they called on Trump to disclose and divest his conflict-laden foreign assets that could endanger our national security, 150, 181
"Weve never seen anything like this in American politics, 181, 190
Every day seems to cast new doubts on whats truly driving Donald Trumps decision-making: the interests of the American people or his own bottom line, 190, 215
He needs to immediately disclose the full extent of his business relationships and foreign assets so the voters can make that determination for themselves." U.S, 215, 240
intelligence officials are seeking to determine whether an American businessman identified by Donald Trump as one of his foreign policy advisers has opened up private communications with senior Russian officials — including talks about the possible lifting of economic sanctions if the Republican nominee becomes president according to multiple sources who have been briefed on the issue, 240, 297
The activities of Trump adviser Carter Page who has extensive business interests in Russia have been discussed with senior members of Congress during recent briefings about suspected efforts by Moscow to influence the presidential election the sources said, 297, 335
After one of those briefings Senate minority leader Harry Reid wrote FBI Director James Comey citing reports of meetings between a Trump adviser (a reference to Page) and "high ranking sanctioned individuals" in Moscow over the summer as evidence of "significant and disturbing ties" between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin that needed to be investigated by the bureau, 335, 394
Some of those briefed were "taken aback" when they learned about Pages contacts in Moscow viewing them as a possible back channel to the Russians that could undercut U.S, 394, 423
foreign policy said a congressional source familiar with the briefings but who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, 423, 445
The source added that U.S, 445, 450
officials in the briefings indicated that intelligence reports about the advisers talks with senior Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin were being "actively monitored and investigated." A senior U.S, 450, 480
law enforcement official did not dispute that characterization when asked for comment by Yahoo News, 480, 495
"Its on our radar screen" said the official about Pages contacts with Russian officials, 495, 509
"Its being looked at." Page is a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow who now runs a New York consulting firm Global Energy Capital located around the corner from Trump Tower that specializes in oil and gas deals in Russia and other Central Asian countries, 509, 555
He declined repeated requests to comment for this story, 555, 564
Trump first mentioned Pages name when asked to identify his "foreign policy team" during anxa0 xa0last March, 564, 581
Describing him then only as a "PhD" Trump named Page as among five advisers "that we are dealing with." But his precise role in the campaign remains unclear; Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks last month called him anxa0 xa0who "does not speak for Mr, 581, 624
Trump or the campaign." Asked this week by Yahoo News Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Page "has no role" and added: "We are not aware of any of his activities past or present." Miller did not respond when asked why Trump had previously described Page as one of his advisers, 624, 675
The questions about Page come amid mounting concerns within the U.S, 675, 686
intelligence community about Russian cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee and state election databases in Arizona and Illinois, 686, 704
In a rare public talk this week former undersecretary of defense for intelligence Mike Vickers said that the Russian cyberattacks constituted meddling in the U.S, 704, 729
election and were "beyond the pale." Also this week two senior Democrats — Sen, 729, 743
Dianne Feinstein ranking minority member on the Senate Intelligence Committee and Rep, 743, 755
Adam Schiff ranking minority member on the House Intelligence Committee — released a joint statement that went further then what U.S, 755, 776
officials had publicly said about the matter, 776, 783
"Based on briefings we have received we have concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S, 783, 808
election" they said, 808, 811
"At the least this effort is intended to sow doubt about the security of our election and may well be intended to influence the outcomes of the election." They added that "orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government." Page came to the attention of officials at the U.S, 811, 873
Embassy in Moscow several years ago when he showed up in the Russian capital during several business trips and made provocative public comments critical of U.S, 873, 899
policy and sympathetic to Putin, 899, 904
"He was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did" said one U.S, 904, 918
official who served in Russia at the time, 918, 926
"He hasnt been shy about expressing those views in the U.S, 926, 937
as well, 937, 939
Last March shorty after he was named by Trump as one of his advisers Pagexa0" xa0he had been an adviser to and investor in Gazprom the Russian state-owned gas company, 939, 969
He then blamed Obama administration sanctions — imposed as a response to the Russian annexation of Crimea — for driving down the companys stock, 969, 993
"So many people who I know and have worked with have been so adversely affected by the sanctions policy" Page said in the interview, 993, 1017
"Theres a lot of excitement in terms of the possibilities for creating a better situation." Page showed up again in Moscow in early July just two weeks before the Republican National Convention formally nominated Trump for president and once again criticized U.S, 1017, 1059
policy, 1059, 1060
Speaking at a commencement address for the New Economic School an institution funded in part by major Russian oligarchs close to Putin Page asserted that "Washington and other West capitals" had impeded progress in Russia "through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization inequality corruption and regime change." At the time Pagexa0 xa0whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip according to a Reuters report, 1060, 1129
But U.S, 1129, 1131
officials have since received intelligence reports that during that same three-day trip Page met with Igor Sechin a longtime Putin associate and former Russian deputy prime minister who is now the executive chairman of Rosneft Russians leading oil company a well-placed Western intelligence source tells Yahoo News, 1131, 1178
That meeting if confirmed is viewed as especially problematic by U.S, 1178, 1189
officials because the Treasury Department in August 2014 named Sechin to a list of Russian officials and businessmen sanctioned over Russias "illegitimate and unlawful actions in the Ukraine." ( xa0described Sechin as "utterly loyal to Vladimir Putin — a key component to his current standing." At their alleged meeting Sechin raised the issue of the lifting of sanctions with Page" the Western intelligence source said, 1189, 1254
U.S, 1254, 1255
intelligence agencies have also received reports that Page met with another top Putin aide while in Moscow — Igor Diveykin, 1255, 1275
A former Russian security official Diveykin now serves as deputy chief for internal policy and is believed by U.S, 1275, 1294
officials to have responsibility for intelligence collected by Russian agencies about the U.S, 1294, 1307
election the Western intelligence source said, 1307, 1313
