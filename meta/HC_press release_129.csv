"Find your friends, 0, 3
Post, 3, 4
Youre done." "The New Hampshire primary is tomorrow and its going to be a close one, 4, 20
Every single person we can get to the polls could make the difference." "Im going to let you in on a little campaign secret: Theres one nearly surefire way to get someone to vote." "In all likelihood you dont live in New Hampshire, 20, 63
Guess what? Neither do Iâ€”but I have a few friends who live in the Granite State and I bet you do too." Please believe that the most important thing you can do right now to help Hillary on Tuesday is send a Facebook message to your friends in New Hampshire.? So for example I might say something like: "Folks Ill be honest with you: Weve got our work cut out for us, 63, 135
As we saw in Iowa every voter contact we make can have an outsized impact, 135, 150
" What are you waiting for? , 150, 156
