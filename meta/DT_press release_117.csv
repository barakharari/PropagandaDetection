New York NY (February 29th 2016) â€” Today Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach announced that he is endorsing Donald J, 0, 21
Trump for the office of President of the United States, 21, 31
"In addition to his duties as Secretary of State Kobach has been one of the nations most prominent advocates of stronger enforcement of immigration laws, 31, 56
He served at the U.S, 56, 61
Department of Justice as Attorney General John Ashcrofts chief adviser on immigration law and border security during 2001-03, 61, 79
In that capacity he designed and implemented the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) which was used to monitor the activities of high-risk aliens in the United States after 9-11, 79, 109
Later he co-authored Arizonas illegal immigration laws of 2007 and 2010, 109, 120
He has helped numerous other states draft state-level laws to reduce illegal immigration, 120, 133
Most notable were Missouris omnibus immigration act of 2008 and Alabamas omnibus immigration act of 2011, 133, 149
Since 2012 he has represented in court ICE agents who sued the Obama Administration in an effort to stop Obamas executive amnesty of 2012." "I am pleased to announce my support for Mr, 149, 182
Trump." said Secretary of State Kris Kobach, 182, 189
"For me the most important issue in the Republican presidential contest is immigration and its effect on our national security, 189, 209
On that issue Mr, 209, 213
Trump stands head and shoulders above the other candidates, 213, 222
He has made it clear that ramping up the enforcement of our immigration laws will be his top priority, 222, 241
And he has forcefully rejected the notion of giving amnesty to illegal aliens living in the United States." "Now more than ever America needs Mr, 241, 266
Trumps aggressive approach to the problem of illegal immigration, 266, 275
Our porous border represents a huge national security threat and our refugee system has been abused by terrorists in the past and is likely to be abused by ISIS terrorists today, 275, 306
Moreover there are too many Americans who are out of work because of illegal immigration or who are working in jobs where the wages are depressed because of illegal immigration." "Finally on the subject of building the wall on our southern border Mr, 306, 349
Trump is correct when he says that the United States has the ability to compel Mexico to pay for it, 349, 369
As I have discussed with Mr, 369, 375
Trump the PATRIOT Act contains a provision that the United States can and should use as leverage with the Government of Mexico, 375, 397
We have the ability to shut down the flow of remittances to Mexico from illegal aliens working in the United States, 397, 418
Mexico will have to make a choice: either make a single payment of $5-10 billion to the United States to pay for the wall or lose most of the $23 billion in remittances that Mexico receives every year from its nationals working in the United States." , 418, 464
