Thank you all! Whoa! Thank you! Thank you, 0, 8
Well I got to tell you this is sure worth staying up for, 8, 21
It is so great to be here in Raleigh here at North Carolina State University, 21, 36
And I cannot imagine a better way of ending this campaign than having the opportunity to see all of you and to watch and listen to Lady Gaga, 36, 64
One of the most inventive creative and passionate performers whose range goes from A to Z and beyond, 64, 82
And I was watching on the screen not only her perform but all of you jumping and singing and waving, 82, 102
It was great!n "Because you know what? Thats what I want for America and the young people of America: the joy the passion the intensity! And our longtime friend Jon Bon Jovi was with us, 102, 137
He was with us up in Philadelphia where he and Bruce Springsteen sang, 137, 150
And Jon said Well hey I want to go down to Raleigh and so here he is! And between now and the time the poll closes tomorrow we are going to be living on a prayer.n" "I was really impressed when everybodys hand went up saying youd already voted, 150, 199
Well go find somebody else who hasnt voted okay? Bring out your friends your roommates strangers on the street, 199, 218
Just stop and talk to them about whats at stake in this election, 218, 231
Because North Carolina is key and its not only important for our election, 231, 244
Are you ready to elect Roy Cooper as your next governor? Well I sure hope so, 244, 260
I sure hope so and I hope youre ready to elect Linda Coleman your lieutenant governor, 260, 276
And how about Dan Blue III for state treasurer? And I really really hope you will send Deborah Ross to Washington!n" "Now we are all fired up, 276, 303
When we were with the President and Michelle in Philadelphia, 303, 313
You know the President was talking about how absolutely consequential this election is and of course it is, 313, 331
I really believe its the most important election of our lifetimes because weve never had a clearer choice, 331, 349
Never, 349, 350
It is a choice between division or unity; between strong steady leadership or a loose cannon who could risk everything, 350, 370
Its a choice between an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top, 370, 386
And it is a choice that really goes to the heart of who we are as Americans.n" "What I saw before I came in and what I see now is a sense of potential of joy, 386, 422
There is no reason my friends why Americas best days are not ahead of us if we reach for them together, 422, 443
We dont have to accept a dark and divisive vision for America, 443, 455
Tomorrow you can vote for a hopeful inclusive big-hearted America.n" Our core values – our core values are being tested in this election but my faith in our future has never been stronger, 455, 488
I love our country and I believe in the American people, 488, 499
And I know if we bring everyone together we can set goals and we can move toward them and we can feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with being part of something bigger than ourselves.n You know one of the great privileges of crisscrossing the country as I have in this campaign is meeting remarkable people – people who stand up against the odds; people who like my late mother people who understand that everybody gets knocked down, 499, 578
What matters is whether you get back up whether you believe you can keep going.n "Last night in Manchester New Hampshire I had the honor of being introduced by an extraordinary man Khizr Khan whose son Captain Khan was killed serving our country in Iraq, 578, 623
You may remember Mr, 623, 627
Khans speech at the Democratic Convention, 627, 633
And again last night he reminded us of the responsibility we all share to protect and defend our Constitution, 633, 652
The story of Captain Khan is one of courage in the face of danger, 652, 666
He was with his unit when he saw a suspicious vehicle, 666, 677
He told his men to stay back, 677, 684
He moved toward the vehicle to check it out, 684, 693
And the bomb went off, 693, 698
He lost his life but everyone else in his unit survived, 698, 709
He was awarded the Bronze Star, 709, 715
And this intensely personal tragedy that the Khan family experienced becoming a Gold Star family was one that they thought about grieved over in the privacy of their home until they heard my opponent start talking about who was acceptable in America and who wasnt, 715, 760
The categories of people starting with immigrants including African Americans and Latinos and POWs and Muslims, 760, 776
The list went on and on, 776, 782
And it created in Mr, 782, 787
Khan a sense of despair because he asked himself would his son have a place in Donald Trumps America? Someone who paid the ultimate price in serving our country.n" Well we can answer that question tomorrow resoundingly: Yes, 787, 825
Absolutely.n "Think about – think about how generations of Americans throughout our history have come together to meet the tests of their time, 825, 848
Our parents our grandparents our great-grandparents defended democracy, 848, 856
They built the great American middle class, 856, 863
They marched for civil rights and voting rights for workers rights and womens rights for LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities, 863, 887
And tomorrow we face the test of our time.n" "So remember its not just my name or Donald Trumps name on the ballot, 887, 910
Its the kind of country we want, 910, 917
Its every issue anyone cares about, 917, 923
So if you believe America thrives when the middle class thrives then you have to vote tomorrow, 923, 940
If you believe we should make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II in infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean energy small business then you have to vote, 940, 969
If you believe we need more fairness in our economy to raise the minimum wage because no one who works full-time should still be in poverty then you have to vote, 969, 1000
If you believe we need to do more to support working families with affordable childcare paid leave and equal pay for women then you have to vote, 1000, 1027
And remember when my opponent says every time I talk about these issues that Im playing the womans card well you know what I say, 1027, 1052
Deal me in, 1052, 1055
And if you believe if you believe all kids deserve good schools with good teachers no matter what house they live in you have to vote, 1055, 1081
And if you believe college should be more affordable you have to vote, 1081, 1094
Bernie Sanders and I worked on a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free if you earn less than $125000 and debt-free for everybody else, 1094, 1120
And for the millions of Americans struggling with student debt we are going to help you pay that down and pay that off, 1120, 1143
If you believe in science and that weve got to address climate change you have to vote, 1143, 1160
If you believe we need to reform our criminal justice system so everyone is treated fairly then you have to vote, 1160, 1181
And if you believe – if you believe we should never write discrimination into our laws well then you know you know North Carolina, 1181, 1205
Youve got to vote to get rid of HB2!n" "Now this is so energizing we could keep going with a long list, 1205, 1227
But heres what – heres what else I want you to know, 1227, 1239
A good thing this election didnt land during exams thats all I can say, 1239, 1253
Look, 1253, 1254
Tomorrow – tomorrow night this election will end, 1254, 1262
But I want you to understand our work together will be just beginning, 1262, 1275
We have to bridge the divides in this country, 1275, 1284
As the Bible says we have to repair the breaches, 1284, 1294
Weve got to be willing to start listening to each other again respecting each other again, 1294, 1310
And I want to thank Gaga because she has always stood for that fundamental principle of respecting everybody.n" So I want you to know and I want you to spread the word, 1310, 1342
I do want to be President for all Americans not just some not just the people who support me and vote for me, 1342, 1365
I want to be President for everyone because we all have a role to play in building that better future for our country and for each of you.n "So if you havent voted yesterday go to iwillvote.com, 1365, 1402
You can get all the info you need, 1402, 1410
And you can still sign up to volunteer, 1410, 1418

We would welcome you to help make sure everybody gets out to vote tomorrow because none of us want to wake up Wednesday morning and wish we had done more, 1435, 1465
Right?n" "And years from today when your kids and grandkids ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line youll be able to say you voted for a stronger fairer better America an America where we build bridges not walls and where we prove conclusively that yes love trumps hate! Thank you! Lets go vote North Carolina! God bless you! Thank you all very much!" , 1465, 1533
