"Tonight Mike Pence said Donald Trump would stand with our allies, 0, 11
Tonight Donald Trump flatly contradicted him, 11, 17
For decades the United States has given an ironclad guarantee to our NATO allies: we will come to their defense if they are attacked just as they came to our defense after 9/11, 17, 50
Donald Trump was asked if he would honor that guarantee, 50, 60
He said… maybe maybe not, 60, 65
Ronald Reagan would be ashamed.xa0Harry Truman would be ashamed, 65, 74
Republicans Democrats and Independents who help build NATO into the most successful military alliance in history would all come to the same conclusion: Donald Trump is temperamentally unfit and fundamentally ill-prepared to be our Commander in Chief, 74, 111
"The President is supposed to be the leader of the free world, 111, 123
Donald Trump apparently doesnt even believe in the free world." "Over the course of this campaign Trump has displayed a bizarre and occasionally obsequious fascination with Russias strongman Vladimir Putin, 123, 153
And he has the policy positions – and advisors – to match, 153, 165
Just this week we learned that the Trump campaign went to great lengths to remove a plank from the GOP platform about aid to Ukraine that would have offended Putin bucking a strongly held position within his own party, 165, 204
Previously he celebrated the Brexit vote and in turn casually predicted the disintegration of Europe, 204, 219
And now he wont even commit to protecting our NATO allies against a Russian invasion, 219, 234
It is fair to assume that Vladimir Putin is rooting for a Trump presidency." "More broadly Trump has apparently decided that America lacks the moral authority to advance our interests and values around the world, 234, 269
He has adopted the logic and positions of China Russia and Iran, 269, 281
And there will be plenty of time in the days ahead to address his strategy to strengthen our coalition against ISIS which apparently can be summed up in one word meetings." The choice in this election is clear, 281, 319
Hillary Clinton will defend our allies, 319, 325
She will protect our people, 325, 330
And she will uphold a bipartisan tradition of American foreign policy that has made us the greatest force for peace progress and prosperity the world has ever known." , 330, 358
