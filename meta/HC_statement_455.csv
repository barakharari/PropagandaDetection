"Donald Trump has business all around the world and while he has failed to disclose full details of his business record what we know is truly disturbing, 0, 27
The idea of a President Trump trying to negotiate with foreign leaders while having his business at stake is simply unacceptable and raises real questions about how he would handle matters of national security, 27, 61
This is just one more reason why he cannot be president." xa0 No recent president has had a portfolio of international business interests as extensive as Mr, 61, 88
Trumps—or as great a level of business engagement on his behalf by offspring who have also played a role in his campaign." His adult children who would run operations if their father becomes president have long dealt with politically connected firms and individuals an overlap of business and politics unseen in the modern White House "Donald Trumps adult children have spent a decade doing business with politically connected foreign firms—a role that will present potential conflicts of interest whether he wins on Nov, 88, 171
8 or continues to pursue politics if he loses." "Those whom Ivanka Trump Donald Trump Jr, 171, 187
and Eric Trump have worked with abroad include: the family of a developer in India who is a ruling-party politician an Azerbaijani government ministers son and a media company that became the Turkish presidents outlet of choice during the July 15 coup attempt." "No recent president has had a portfolio of international business interests as extensive as Mr, 187, 245
Trumps—or as great a level of business engagement on his behalf by offspring who have also played a role in his campaign." U.S, 245, 268
law exempts the president and vice president from conflict-of-interest rules that require many federal employees to recuse themselves from decisions involving their financial interests, 268, 292
Presidents George W, 292, 295
Bush Bill Clinton George H.W, 295, 300
Bush and Ronald Reagan voluntarily put most assets in blind trusts, 300, 311
Presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that if elected he would have created a federally qualifying blind trust, 311, 328
A President Trump "would not be involved in the business" said Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten, 328, 345
"His focus obviously would be on the office of the presidency and Don Ivanka and Eric would run the company." Mr, 345, 366
Trumps campaign referred questions to Mr, 366, 372
Garten, 372, 373
The three Trump children didnt respond to requests for comment sent through the campaign and the company, 373, 390
"Trump Organization is the umbrella company operating the familys businesses including real-estate assets and units that manage hotels and condo towers around the world, 390, 414
Much of that is domestic but its new business in recent years has been heavily overseas—the last 10 new real-estate or real-estate branding deals it has announced are all abroad." "That business largely consists of licensing deals and in some cases management deals with foreign developers building condo and hotel towers, 414, 465
Clients include wealthy business people and politicians who buy Trump-branded condos, 465, 476
Mr, 476, 477
Trumps adult children have in recent years taken over day-to-day management of much of the business." The filial arrangement would raise questions about potential conflicts of interest in a Trump presidency especially in dealings abroad said Aaron Friedberg a national-security adviser to Dick Cheney when he was vice president, 477, 526
"The fact is that his family is involved in business with a list of players—I dont assume we know them all—in all kinds of places in many of which the distinction between politics and business is blurry" said Mr, 526, 565
Friedberg, 565, 566
"Anybody youre dealing with in those places that has a lot of money is involved in politics in some way, 566, 586
How can you insulate it?" This would also likely come up as an issue for Mr, 586, 602
Trump if he stays involved in politics Mr, 602, 610
Friedberg said, 610, 612
"It seems to me that a number of questions have been raised that have not been answered" he said, 612, 631
"Its not going to go away." Mr, 631, 638
Friedberg is among former Republican national-security officials who signed a letter stating they wouldnt vote for Mr, 638, 655
Trump because they didnt believe he was qualified from a foreign-policy perspective, 655, 667
Mr, 667, 668
Trump called the signatories "the failed Washington elite" and released a list of military leaders who support him, 668, 686
"The letter Mr, 686, 689
Friedberg signed didnt mention Mr, 689, 694
Trumps foreign business ties but he and several other signatories said those ties contributed to their reservations, 694, 711
The Trump children would be doing business with companies that might assume they have unique access to the president Mr, 711, 731
Friedberg said and with companies whose interests might differ from the national interests their father would be representing." Those potential conflicts are similar to those that have arisen from the Clinton Foundations foreign donors said Eric Edelman who directed Defense Department policy under President George W, 731, 777
Bush and signed the letter opposing Mr, 777, 784
Trump, 784, 785
Mr, 785, 786
Trump and others have called those Clinton Foundation donations a "pay-for-play" arrangement suggesting foreign contributors to the Clinton family charity may have expected to gain access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, 786, 821
"They are slightly different cases" said Mr, 821, 828
Edelman "but both raise very serious concerns about influence peddling and conflicts of interest." The Clinton Foundation whose donations go into charity work said it has stopped accepting most foreign donations and would stop taking all such donations if Mrs, 828, 868
Clinton became president, 868, 871
It said her daughter Chelsea Clinton would remain involved with the foundation, 871, 883
Trump Organizations Mr, 883, 886
Garten acknowledged that the extent of Mr, 886, 893
Trumps international business connections is unique for a presidential nominee, 893, 903
"I respect that this is different" he said, 903, 911
"It is a new situation, 911, 916
I dont believe it presents a conflict." "Mr, 916, 924
Garten and the Trump campaign didnt respond to subsequent inquiries as to Mr, 924, 937
Trumps plans beyond the presidential race." "Among potential conflicts is the Trump companys relationship with Turkeys Dogan Holding said Mr, 937, 957
Edelman the former Bush-administration official and onetime ambassador to Turkey, 957, 967
Dogan operates oil companies a real-estate empire and media properties in Turkey." "Mr, 967, 980
Trumps May 2016 federal disclosure reports income to one of his companies in the range of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from Dogan related to Istanbul towers bearing Mr, 980, 1014
Trumps name—a deal involving Ivanka Trump early on according to a 2012 Trump press release, 1014, 1029
She and her father visited the tower a day after Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended the official opening of its associated mall." "The night of the failed coup Dogans flagship television network became the venue through which Mr, 1029, 1069
Erdogan appealed to citizens to oppose the putsch, 1069, 1077
That was a turnabout for Dogan whose chairman and other executives this year were charged in Turkey with criminal tax evasion widely seen as retaliation for a perceived antigovernment slant by Dogan media outlets, 1077, 1111
A person close to the Dogan family said there has been no wrongdoing." "Since the failed coup Dogans media group has taken on a more pro-government line including broadcasts supporting Mr, 1111, 1142
Erdogans claim that Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen was responsible for the putsch." "Turkey has asked the U.S, 1142, 1159
to extradite Mr, 1159, 1162
Gulen who lives in Pennsylvania and has denied the allegation, 1162, 1172
The U.S, 1172, 1174
Justice Department has said it is reviewing that request; privately many senior U.S, 1174, 1187
officials have said they are skeptical of Turkeys claims against Mr, 1187, 1198
Gulen." The next American president will likely inherit that thorny bilateral dispute, 1198, 1210
Mr, 1210, 1211
Garten said the Dogan relationship wouldnt be a problem because the Trump Organization would be separate from Mr, 1211, 1229
Trump, 1229, 1230
The person close to Dogan said the company would prefer to remove the Trump name from its buildings based on the candidates "anti-Muslim rhetoric." "When Donald Trump Jr, 1230, 1258
sought a few years ago to expand his fathers real-estate empire in Latin America he turned to businessman Camilo Benedetti brother of a Colombian senator." Mr, 1258, 1284
Benedetti took the younger Mr, 1284, 1289
Trump around Mexico in 2010 and Colombia in 2011 where Mr, 1289, 1300
Benedetti had relationships with top government officials Mr, 1300, 1308
Benedetti said, 1308, 1310
One meeting was with Colombias leader at the presidential palace Casa de Nariño, 1310, 1323
"I asked him as a favor" Mr, 1323, 1330
Benedetti said of the president, 1330, 1335
The meeting didnt result in any active business developments said Mr, 1335, 1346
Benedetti and Mr, 1346, 1349
Garten, 1349, 1350
"Theres no question that whenever the Trump Organization looks into a project or enters a new market there is often excitement both from the business sector and maybe even in some countries the government" Mr, 1350, 1385
Garten said of the meeting and others like it that the Trump children have had with foreign leaders, 1385, 1403
"One of the newest Trump partners Indonesian media magnate Hary Tanoesoedibjo had business ties with family members of Suharto the countrys late dictator, 1403, 1426
He ran unsuccessfully for vice president in the most-recent national election and formed a political party critical of the current government." "Last year Trump Organization announced a deal to manage a Bali resort owned by Mr, 1426, 1462
Tanoesoedibjos company PT Global Mediacom Tbk and to develop a golf resort in West Java with him, 1462, 1479
Mr, 1479, 1480
Trump reported a range of $2 million to $10 million income to his companies from the projects since the beginning of 2015 in his May 2016 federal disclosures, 1480, 1508
Donald Trump Jr, 1508, 1511
was involved in the deals according to news releases announcing them, 1511, 1522
Mr, 1522, 1523
Garten declined to comment on the Indonesian project, 1523, 1531
Mr, 1531, 1532
Tanoesoedibjos assistant didnt respond to requests for comment." "In Mumbai India the Trump Organization has a brand-licensing deal for a condo tower with Lodha Group whose founder Mangal Prabhat Lodha is among Indias wealthiest property owners and a member of his states legislature from Indias ruling party." Mr, 1532, 1580
Trumps May 2016 federal disclosure shows income to a Trump Organization company of $1 million to $5 million since the beginning of 2015 from the licensing deal, 1580, 1607
A Lodha spokeswoman said both companies "work with the highest standards of professionalism and integrity." Mr, 1607, 1623
Garten said that Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr, 1623, 1632
worked on the project and that he isnt concerned that Mr, 1632, 1643
Lodha is a politician, 1643, 1647
"Theres a great relationship between Mr, 1647, 1653
Trumps children and the principals of that project" he said, 1653, 1663
"I dont see the potential issue." In Azerbaijan Mr, 1663, 1672
Trumps July 2015 federal disclosure reports that a company owned by Mr, 1672, 1684
Trump had received $2.5 million in income since the beginning of 2014 in a deal that includes management services for a hotel and condo tower being developed by Anar Mammadov whose father is the countrys transportation minister, 1684, 1721
Ivanka Trumps website says she oversaw the project "since its inception." Mr, 1721, 1733
Garten said the project is on hold, 1733, 1740
"The Azerbaijan America Alliance in a press release listed Mr, 1740, 1750
Mammadov as its founder, 1750, 1754
The group spent $12.6 million between 2011 and 2015 on federal lobbyists to promote Azerbaijan interests in Washington according to federal filings compiled by Center For Responsive Politics, 1754, 1782
Calls to the number given on Mr, 1782, 1789
Mammadovs company website werent answered, 1789, 1794
Calls to the Azerbaijan America Alliances number were answered by a lobbying firm that said it didnt represent the alliance anymore." "Its not unusual for people around the world successful in a business to play some role in government" Mr, 1794, 1834
Garten said of Trump Organizations dealings with politically connected foreign businesses, 1834, 1845
"That doesnt mean theres anything wrong or inappropriate." , 1845, 1853
