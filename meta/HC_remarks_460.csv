"Hello Detroit! Thank you! Ill tell you I am so glad to be back in Michigan, 0, 16
And that introduction Im just still vibrating from it, 16, 25
I thank my longtime friend Reverend Wendell Anthony for giving us some of the best lines that weve had in the whole campaign, 25, 48
Thank you Wendell.n" "You know theres something special about this place, 48, 59
And some of you may have recognized the song that was playing when I came in an amazing anthem sung by the talented Andra Day called Rise Up, 59, 87
And that is what Detroit is doing – you are rising up! And that is exactly what were going to do in America, 87, 110
We are going to rise up and make sure the American dream is big enough for everyone.n" "Im looking forward to working with the great team you have here in Detroit and in Michigan, 110, 144
I want to thank your senators Senator Debbie Stabenow and Senator Gary Peters, 144, 157
I want to thank your members of Congress Congressman John Conyers Sandy Levin Congresswomen Brenda Lawrence and Debbie Dingell, 157, 176
I want to thank your great mayor Mayor Mike Duggan and thank you, 176, 189
Wayne County Executive Warren Evans, 189, 194
Sheriff Benny Napoleon, 194, 197
The president of the UAW Dennis Williams, 197, 204
Longtime friends and former colleagues of mine former Senator Carl Levin and his wife Barbara are here, 204, 221
And to all who are present today, 221, 228
And I was delighted that my friend and my supporter Mark Cuban could be here because – hes not only a real billionaire – hes actually shared his profits with his employees.n" Now are you ready to vote on Tuesday? Are you ready to volunteer to get everybody out to vote? Are you ready to choose our next president and commander-in-chief? Did any of you see the three debates that we had? Well I spent four and a half hours standing next to Donald Trump proving once and for all I have the stamina to be the next president.n "Now he kept saying a lot of unusual things didnt he? And you know theres a certain preparation you do to be ready for those debates and of course I did it because I think you should prepare to be president of the United States, 228, 372
And I did practice my composure, 372, 378
People said to me well how did you do that? The things he was saying, 378, 393
And then in that second debate when he was following you around and lurching over you, 393, 409
I said well I did practice, 409, 415
And I had my friends and my family just spend hours saying terrible things to me, 415, 431
So I was ready, 431, 435
But he would say like Well what have you done for 30 years? And you know I dont want to brag, 435, 456
But I do think it matters what youve done and especially what youve done that maybe improves somebody elses life right?n" "And one of the great joys of this campaign has been traveling around our country meeting people who have been affected by what weve been doing, 456, 503
For example as First Lady I helped create the Childrens Health Insurance Program which covers eight million kids, 503, 521
And these are families that theyre not poor families theyre working people but they dont make enough money and they dont work for somebody who provides insurance and so very often their kids were being affected by not getting the health care they should have had, 521, 567
I met a woman whose baby daughter when she was born was diagnosed as totally deaf and the doctor said Were sorry theres really nothing we can do for her, 567, 597
But this mother like many mothers I know did not take that for an answer right? She got on the internet, 597, 618
She began to research and she found that there were treatments that she could maybe provide to her little daughter but they were expensive and she and her husband didnt have that kind of money and they didnt have insurance, 618, 658
She was at her doctors office and just so distraught and the doctor said Well theres this new thing called the Childrens Health Insurance Program, 658, 683
Maybe you should look into it, 683, 689
Turned out she was eligible, 689, 694
She signed up, 694, 697
She started giving her daughter the best health care that every child in this country should be able to have by the way, 697, 720
And when I was in North Carolina I heard about her and I got to meet her but more than that I met her daughter who talked to me and who just graduated from college – because she got the health care and she got the treatment that she deserved to have.n" "Ill tell you what that is how I judge my last 30 years, 720, 785
Have I done something to help somebody else? I am well aware of the blessings that I have had and I want to be sure that all of us figure out a way to pay it forward make it possible for more families more kids to have the chance to live up to their own God-given potential.n" "And I was a Senator in New York on 9/11 so I know what can happen – the evil and the hatred of terrorism, 785, 866
I saw it, 866, 869
And I spent my time helping to rebuild New York City and helping to get health care for the brave first responders who ran toward danger not away from it – our police our firefighters our EMTs, 869, 906
And Ill tell you who else we got covered, 906, 915
We got construction workers who ran with their supplies and their tools and I see one right out there who knows exactly what Im talking about, 915, 941
All across the city people were leaving their job sites and rushing toward danger, 941, 955
That was America at its best, 955, 961
And dont ever forget what we are capable of being who we are, 961, 974
We are not afraid, 974, 978
We are brave courageous people who will do our best if given the chance.n" "As your Secretary of State I went to 112 countries negotiated ceasefires reduced the threat of nuclear weapons stood up for human rights and womens rights and worker rights and LGBT rights, 978, 1024
Im telling you this because I want you to know that I will do everything I can, 1024, 1041
If I am honored to be your president I will get up every day in that White House and I will go to work for you and your families to make it possible for you to get the chances and the opportunities you deserve to have.n" "I want you to have a candidate you can vote for and not just someone to vote against, 1041, 1105
Thats why Tim Kaine and I have run a campaign based on ideas and issues not insults because if you really take a look at what is at stake in this election it is a choice between two very different visions for America, 1105, 1148
Ive got to say when I hear my opponent talk about America I dont recognize the country hes talking about, 1148, 1168
It is so dark so divisive so hateful, 1168, 1176
That is not the America that I believe in, 1176, 1185
I believe that we should have a confident optimistic inclusive vision of where were going and how were going to get there, 1185, 1207
I love our country and I believe in the American people, 1207, 1218
And I think theres nothing we cant achieve if we work together and we set some goals and we go after them, 1218, 1240
You see we believe in an America that is bighearted not small-minded, 1240, 1252
We believe in an America that is already great but can be greater if we do our part, 1252, 1270
And we believe America is great because America is good, 1270, 1280
Never forget that, 1280, 1283
If we lift each other up and not tear each other down we can go even further, 1283, 1300
And I believe with all my heart, 1300, 1307
Thats why the slogan of my campaign sums it up that we are stronger together.n" And so come next January 20th America is going to have a new president, 1307, 1336
I know – I know that – I know that a lot of people say that they want change, 1336, 1355
Well let me tell you this, 1355, 1361
Change is inevitable, 1361, 1364
There will be change, 1364, 1368
The question is what kind of change are we going to have?n Are we going to build a stronger fairer better country or are we going to fear the future and each other? I sure hope not, 1368, 1405
That is not the America that I believe we are.n "And so here is what I want to ask you to do, 1405, 1427
I want you to talk to your friends and your family and your neighbors, 1427, 1441
Michigan is one of these states that doesnt have early voting, 1441, 1452
Ive been all over the country going to states that are already voting, 1452, 1465
In fact I dont know, 1465, 1470
About 31 to 32-3 million people have already voted in those states, 1470, 1482
But Michigan votes on Tuesday.n" "And I imagine – I imagine there are – some of you know people who say theyre going to vote for Donald Trump, 1482, 1510
Right? I know, 1510, 1513
I know, 1513, 1515
I understand that, 1515, 1518
I mean I would hope you would try to stage an intervention before its too late, 1518, 1534
But maybe you could ask them with you to imagine imagine January 20th 2017, 1534, 1548
And imagine that my opponent is taking the oath of office in front of the Capitol, 1548, 1564
Imagine having a president who demeans women and mocks the disabled who insults African Americans and Latinos and Muslims who personally engages in busting unions and preventing people from having the right to bargain collectively, 1564, 1599
Now the truth is we really dont have to imagine what that would be like because everything he has said and done both in his career and in this campaign tells you what could happen.n" "Now Michelle Obama who says so many wise and wonderful things she said the presidency doesnt change who you are; it reveals who you are, 1599, 1659
And I think weve seen who Donald Trump is.n" Maya Angelou another great American Maya Angelou said when someone shows you who he is believe him the first time, 1659, 1688
And if my opponent were to win we would have a president who has only ever been in it for himself.n "Just last year he said again it wouldnt have mattered if we had rescued the auto industry or let it go bankrupt, 1688, 1731
What is he talking about? Im proud that President Obama saved the auto industry, 1731, 1745
And Im even prouder that because of the hard work of people in Detroit and across Michigan and the Midwest the U.S, 1745, 1767
auto industry just had its best year ever.n" "If Donald wins the election wed have a president who wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to visit the United States, 1767, 1800
We are a country founded on religious freedom, 1800, 1808
That runs contrary to our Constitution, 1808, 1814
We would have a president who has said repeatedly that he thinks the lives of black people are all about crime and poverty and despair, 1814, 1839
He has no idea about the strength of the black church and the vibrancy of black-owned businesses and the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, 1839, 1865
He seems to know nothing about the rise of a new generation of black activists and the success of black leaders in every field, 1865, 1889
I think he needs a visit from Reverend Wendell Anthony dont you?n" "Yesterday in North Carolina I was honored to stand with a woman named Mae Brown Wiggins, 1889, 1917
Decades ago she was a hard-working nurse in New York City, 1917, 1928
She was looking for an apartment that she could afford to rent, 1928, 1940
But Donald Trump and his father Fred turned her away, 1940, 1950
You see whenever African Americans tried to rent Trump apartments their application was marked with a C C for colored, 1950, 1970
And that didnt sit very well with Mae so she went to the authorities and eventually the Department of Justice sued the to us for housing discrimination, 1970, 1997
And although they settled they wouldnt change, 1997, 2004
So the government had to take them back to court, 2004, 2014
Thats a pattern, 2014, 2017
This is what happens time and time again with my opponent, 2017, 2028
If he were to win he would be in charge of the Federal Housing Department, 2028, 2043
If he doesnt respect all Americans now how can we trust him to serve all Americans in the future?n" "He has such a casual disregard of our Constitution, 2043, 2071
He doesnt seem to understand the rule of law that we really are a nation of laws not men, 2071, 2090
Heres the latest example, 2090, 2094
There was a terrible crime back in 1990 in New York City, 2094, 2106
It was called the Central Park Five, 2106, 2113
Maybe some of you have heard of it, 2113, 2121
There were five black and Latino kids some as young as 14, 2121, 2133
They were wrongfully convinced and they were in prison where they spent years, 2133, 2146
Donald Trump took out full-page ads calling for the death penalty for the kids, 2146, 2160
And even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence and someone else confessed to that terrible crime Trump actually said they should still be in prison, 2160, 2186
It doesnt matter if youre innocent, 2186, 2192
If he decides that you should be in prison or you should be locked up, 2192, 2207
No wonder he admired Vladimir Putin because thats exactly what Putin does to his people.n" "So we cant trust him with our Constitution, 2207, 2230
We cant trust him to obey the rule of law, 2230, 2240
He has shown us who he is, 2240, 2247
Now we have to decide who we are, 2247, 2255
So let me paint you a different picture, 2255, 2263
Here is what were going to do together if we win this election on Tuesday night.n" "We have three big challenges, 2263, 2284
Number one we got to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top, 2284, 2301
Number two weve got to keep our country safe and we have to work with our allies to lead the world with strength and intelligence toward peace and prosperity, 2301, 2330
Number three weve got to bring our country together, 2330, 2339
We have got to overcome these divides, 2339, 2346
We have to heal our nation, 2346, 2352
And I hope that you will help me meet all three of those challenges.n" "I have said repeatedly that were going to take on discrimination and bigotry because any time we hold somebody back it can lead to holding other people back, 2352, 2394
We cant accept as normal what were seeing across our country because of his campaign, 2394, 2409
A church in Mississippi was burned this week, 2409, 2417
Someone painted Vote Trump on the side and then set it on fire, 2417, 2430
We cant let – we cant let that happen, 2430, 2439
What happened in Flint Michigan should not be normal or acceptable, 2439, 2450
Our kids should be guaranteed clean air and clean water, 2450, 2460
Those are basics, 2460, 2463
Weve got to do everything we can to make sure that we take care of our children.n" "And its important for us to recognize that when I talk about getting the economy to work for everybody that means I want the biggest jobs program since World War II – infrastructure advanced manufacturing clean renewable energy technology, 2463, 2519
Some people say we cant do that, 2519, 2526
Well Im telling you theyre wrong, 2526, 2532
Theyre wrong, 2532, 2534
We have the best workers the most productive workers, 2534, 2543
Were going to give them more to work on more products to produce, 2543, 2556
And were going to do more for small business because small business is the backbone of so many communities, 2556, 2575
And I want everybody to have the chance to succeed in America, 2575, 2587
That means were going to dismantle the so-called school-to-prison pipeline and replace it with the cradle-to-college pipeline.n" "And were going to make sure that every child has a chance to go to a good school with good teachers no matter what zip code that child lives in, 2587, 2634
And I want to start with our youngest kids with pre-kindergarten programs, 2634, 2646
And then I want to be a good partner with our teachers, 2646, 2658
Weve got to have high expectation and get results in helping our children, 2658, 2671
And I want to be sure that we put technical education back into high school because there are good jobs out there waiting for young people with the skills to do them.n" "Itll be important that we create an environment in which our police and our communities can work together and trust each other, 2671, 2725
I believe we are safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law, 2725, 2744
And thats what were going to work for.n" "Were also going to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, 2744, 2766
This has nothing to do with the scare tactics coming from my opponent, 2766, 2779
Have you seen hes starting to wear a camo hat now? Really, 2779, 2791
We are going to work with responsible gun owners who understand that weve got to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldnt have them in the first place.n" "And while we create more safe communities we want to invest in those communities, 2791, 2836
I want to continue the good work that our past two Democratic Presidents have done one named Clinton one named Obama, 2836, 2857
And I want to be a really strong partner, 2857, 2866
Ill compete a little with them, 2866, 2872
I want to be a really strong partner with Detroit and other cities that are on the way back up to make sure you get the investment and the support the housing and the jobs that you need.n" "But we also have to make sure our economy is fairer, 2872, 2921
Thats why I believe we should raise the national minimum wage because people who work full time should not be left in poverty, 2921, 2944
And isnt it finally time to guarantee equal pay for women? This is not a womens issue, 2944, 2961
If you have a wife a mother a daughter or a sister who works its your issue, 2961, 2978
Its a family issue, 2978, 2982
And every time I talk about wanting to have affordable childcare paid family leave equal pay for women the other side accuses me of playing the womens card, 2982, 3010
Ill tell you what if standing up for equal pay is playing the womens card then deal me in.n" "And one of the other big challenges were going to take on – I am so excited about this, 3010, 3048
I am really proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran because it was a campaign about issues, 3048, 3068
And what we decided after it was over is how we could work together to make sure that everybody who wants to go to college can afford not just to start but actually to graduate, 3068, 3103
So we came up with a plan that if you go to a public college or university you will go tuition-free if your family makes less than $125000 a year, 3103, 3133
And it will be debt-free for everybody above that so you dont go into debt, 3133, 3148
And for people who already have student debt were going to help you pay it down and pay it off to get out from under it, 3148, 3174
And I want especially to support historically black colleges and universities that have done so much to bring forth a leadership cadre in our country.n" "Now this is just some of what we are offering in this campaign because we really believe you need to look at what will happen after the election, 3174, 3227
I had a friend say to me the other day People are just frustrated and angry, 3227, 3243
I get that, 3243, 3246
I understand that, 3246, 3249
We had the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression in 08 and 09, 3249, 3263
Millions of people lost their jobs millions lost their homes family wealth was wiped out, 3263, 3278
That is a trauma and people are still suffering and still climbing back from that, 3278, 3293
I get it, 3293, 3296
But I learned a long time ago from my late mother anger is not a plan, 3296, 3312
Right? Be angry vent about it and then roll up your sleeves and get to work, 3312, 3328
Thats what I will do, 3328, 3333
Thats why weve put this all down, 3333, 3340
Its on our website hillaryclinton.com, 3340, 3345
Its in a book that Tim Kaine and I put out called Stronger Together, 3345, 3359
Because not only do I want you to know what I will try to do as your president; I want you to hold me accountable, 3359, 3384
I want you when I come back to Detroit which I will do when I travel around Michigan which I will do I want you to say Well hows it going getting those new jobs started? How much progress are we making on making sure college is affordable? I believe in making lists, 3384, 3437
Maybe its a womens thing, 3437, 3442
My husband said – once said to me one time You have lists of your lists, 3442, 3458
Well I do because I want to know what were going to get done and how we can make progress together.n" And ultimately this election really is about the kind of country we want for our kids and in my case now my grandkids, 3458, 3502
Are we really a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all?"n  "Yes."n  "Are we really a nation that recognizes our best years can still be ahead of us if we make up our minds to have that be our goal? I believe we can do this together, 3502, 3551
My opponent at his convention said I alone can fix it, 3551, 3562
Well no nobody alone does anything, 3562, 3568
When our founders met in Philadelphia it wasnt one person creating our country, 3568, 3581
It was many people working together and fighting a revolution to get that democracy and then to fight for civil rights and voting rights and workers rights and womens rights and LGBT rights, 3581, 3614
None of them – none of them were won by one person alone, 3614, 3627
The American labor movement didnt happen because somebody one day said I alone can make it happen, 3627, 3644
It took millions of people in every one of these movements marching and speaking out and sitting in, 3644, 3662
Barack Obama wasnt put into the White House by one person alone, 3662, 3674
It took everybody working and organizing and yes voting, 3674, 3683
That is how progress happens in America.n "So really it all comes down to you my friends, 3683, 3700
You have to vote, 3700, 3704
Our progress is on the line, 3704, 3710
Everything that has happened up until this point is on the line, 3710, 3722
Im ready to defend and build on the progress that weve made, 3722, 3734
Im proud I was a member of President Obamas cabinet, 3734, 3744
Im proud that – he and I are friends, 3744, 3753
But he knows and I know that American leadership American presidents its like running a relay, 3753, 3769
You do your very best and then you pass off the baton and you just hope that the person you pass it off to doesnt drop to the ground or doesnt turn around and run back the way we came from which is what my opponent is promising to do.n" "Now Ive told the President that when he hands off the baton that hes going to have to bend over, 3769, 3839
Hes a lot taller than I am, 3839, 3846
But Im excited about what we can do, 3846, 3854
I know this has been a tough campaign, 3854, 3862
Ive got people coming up to me saying theyve got migraines they never had before, 3862, 3877
They have stomachaches that they dont know what theyre going to do with, 3877, 3890
I get it, 3890, 3893
It has been in many ways a really tough campaign but Ill tell you what, 3893, 3908
Michigan you can make the difference.n" "All Im asking you is talk to your friends talk to your family talk to your coworkers talk to everybody, 3908, 3934
If you have time to volunteer go to hillaryclinton.com to volunteer or text join J?o-i-n to 47246, 3934, 3951
Because when your children – and there are some beautiful children in this crowd here today, 3951, 3967
When your children or grandchildren ask what you did in 2016 when everything was on the line I want you to be able to say I voted for a better stronger fairer America, 3967, 4000
An America where we build bridges not walls, 4000, 4008
And where we prove once and for all that love trumps hate, 4008, 4020
Lets get to work, 4020, 4024
Thank you, 4024, 4026
Thank you Detroit, 4026, 4029
Thank you Michigan, 4029, 4032
God bless you." , 4032, 4035
