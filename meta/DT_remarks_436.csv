"Thank you, 0, 2
Its great to be here today." In particular I want to thank Mr, 2, 15
Ron Packard and Ms, 15, 19
Deborah Mays for hosting me at their school, 19, 27
Today we are going to discuss one of the most important issues in this campaign: school choice, 27, 44
But before we do I want to briefly discuss new revelations about Hillary Clintons emails, 44, 59
According to the FBI report: "The FBI did find that hostile foreign actors gained access to the personal email accounts of individuals with whom Clinton was in regular contact and in doing so obtained emails sent to or received by Clinton on her personal account." Remember Hillary Clinton was emailing about the drone program – among many other extremely sensitive matters, 59, 120
This is yet more evidence that Hillary Clinton is unfit to be commander-in-chief, 120, 133
By the way the whole country saw how unfit she was at the Townhall last night where she refused to take accountability for her failed policies in the Middle East that have produced millions of refugees unleashed the horror of radical Islamic terrorism and made us less safe than ever before, 133, 184
Throughout it all she put the entire country at risk in order to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State, 184, 205
These include scandals like giving up our uranium to Russia doing favors for UBS bank and selling contracts to friends and family in Haiti, 205, 229
"Its all about hiding her criminal enterprise at the Clinton Foundation." "As part of her criminal cover-up Hillary Clintons staff digitally bleached her emails after receiving a Congressional Subpoena, 229, 258
Her staff also destroyed some of her 13 different phones with a hammer." Then when she was interviewed by the FBI she claimed she couldnt remember important events 39 times, 258, 288
She couldnt even remember whether she was trained on handling classified information, 288, 300
She even said she didnt know that the letter "C" stood for confidential classified information, 300, 315
"All the while as Hillary and Bill raked in millions of dollars from special interests the world fell apart, 315, 334
Hillary Clintons policies produced ruin in Libya Iraq and Syria, 334, 344
She failed in Russia in China in North Korea." Her policies unleashed ISIS spread terrorism and put Iran on the path to nuclear weapons – not to mention the ransom payments, 344, 375
"On top of it all Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy, 375, 384
Shes raced to invade intervene and topple regimes, 384, 392
She believes in globalism not Americanism." "Last night she even falsely said no American died in Libya, 392, 409
Then she also falsely said theres no ground troops in Iraq even though we have 5000 military personnel there right now." Iraq is one of the biggest differences in this race, 409, 440
I opposed going in and I opposed the reckless way Hillary Clinton took us out – letting ISIS fill the void, 440, 461
But I was opposed to the war from the beginning, 461, 471
Long after Howard Stern but three months before the Iraq war started I said in an interview with Neil Cavuto that "perhaps we shouldnt be doing it yet" and that "the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the President is concerned." Then On March 25th of 2003 just days after the war started I was quoted as saying the war is "a mess" yet more clear evidence that I had opposed the war from the start, 471, 550
In July of 2003 I said that "I would love to see New York City and some of the cities and some of the states get some of the money that`s going toward Iraq and other places because you know they really need and it they need it badly." I had a number of quotes to this effect, 550, 608
Then in August of 2004 very early in the conflict I made a detailed statement to Esquire magazine, 608, 626
"Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that were in, 626, 638
I would never have handled it that way, 638, 646
Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? Cmon, 646, 690
Two minutes after we leave theres going to be a revolution and the meanest toughest smartest most vicious guy will take over, 690, 712
"What was the purpose of the whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed, 712, 727
And what about the people coming back with no arms and no legs? Not to mention the other side, 727, 746
All those Iraqi kids whove been blown to pieces, 746, 755
And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong, 755, 770
All this for nothing!" I would have been tougher on terrorism, 770, 781
Bin Laden would have been caught long ago." "Had I been in Congress at the time of the invasion I would have cast a vote in opposition, 781, 808
For years I have been a critic of the kind of reckless foreign invasions and interventions that have been the Hallmark of Hillary Clintons failed career." Here is the bottom line: I was a private citizen, 808, 844
I had no access to the briefings that Hillary Clinton had, 844, 855
But in Iraq my judgement was right and hers was wrong, 855, 866
"Hillary Clinton is always complaining about whats wrong but shes been there for more than 30 years and has never done anything about it – all you have to do is look at New York State when she was a Senator, 866, 907
All talk but nothing happened." "Were on track to spend $6 trillion altogether on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan." Meanwhile massive portions of our country are in a state of disrepair, 907, 939
"Its time to rebuild America." Too many Americans living in our inner cities have not been included in the American Dream, 939, 960
We are one nation and when any part of our country hurts – our whole country hurts, 960, 977
My goal as President will be to ensure that every child in this nation – African-American Hispanic-American all Americans – will be placed on the ladder of success: a great education and a great job, 977, 1012
That ladder rests on a fundamental foundation: safety, 1012, 1020
In order to help our children succeed our first duty is to ensure that every kid in America can grow up in a safe community, 1020, 1045
"You cant have prosperity without security." This is the new civil rights agenda of our time, 1045, 1061
The right to a safe community a quality education and a secure job, 1061, 1074
Our campaign represents the long-awaited chance to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a New American Future, 1074, 1096
There is no failed policy more in need of urgent change than our government-run education monopoly, 1096, 1112
The Democratic Party has trapped millions of African-American and Hispanic youth in failing government schools that deny them the opportunity to join the ladder of American success, 1112, 1139
It is time to break-up that monopoly, 1139, 1146
I want every single inner city child in America who is today trapped in a failing school to have the freedom – the civil right – to attend the school of their choice, 1146, 1179
This includes private schools traditional public schools magnet schools and charter schools which must be included in any definition of school choice, 1179, 1201
"Our government spends more than enough money to easily pay for this initiative – with billions left over, 1201, 1219
Its simply a matter of putting students first not the education bureaucracy." "Lets run through the numbers." "At the state and federal level the United States spends more than $620 billion on K-12 education each year, 1219, 1255
Thats an average of about $12296 for every student enrolled in our elementary and secondary public schools." The federal government pays for about 10 percent—$64 billion to be precise—of the K-12 costs, 1255, 1287
That $64 billion makes up about half of the total spending of the U.S, 1287, 1301
Department of Education, 1301, 1304
The other roughly $570 billion spent on K-12 education comes from the states, 1304, 1317
We spend more per student than almost any other major country in the world, 1317, 1331
Yet our students perform near the bottom of the pack for major large advanced countries, 1331, 1346
Our largest cities spend some of the largest amounts of money on public schools, 1346, 1360
New York City spends $20226 dollars per pupil, 1360, 1368
Baltimore spends $15287 dollars per student, 1368, 1374
Chicago spends $11976 dollars per student and in Los Angeles it is $10602, 1374, 1387
Just imagine if each student in these school systems was given a scholarship for this amount of money – allowing them and their family to choose the public or private school of their choice, 1387, 1421
Not only would this empower families but it would create a massive education market that is competitive and produces better outcomes, 1421, 1442
"These schools would then cater to the needs of the individual student and family – not the needs of the Teachers Union, 1442, 1464
There is no more important job than a teacher and teachers will benefit greatly from these reforms." The current government monopoly while great for the bureaucrats has utterly failed too many students, 1464, 1496
According to the National Assessment of Education Progress only 1 in 6 African-American students in the eighth grade are considered proficient in math and reading, 1496, 1521
Failing schools then contribute to failing economies, 1521, 1528
In Los Angeles the official unemployment rate for African-American men is almost 20.7 percent, 1528, 1542
In Baltimore it is 16.2 percent 14.7 percent in Chicago and 10.9 percent in New York City, 1542, 1559
In Los Angeles 26 percent of African American women live in poverty, 1559, 1571
In Baltimore the poverty rate for African Americans is 27 percent, 1571, 1582
In New York over 31 percent of African Americans live in poverty, 1582, 1594
Nationwide nearly 40% of African-American children live in poverty – including 45% of children under the age of six, 1594, 1613
Our public schools are failing to put young Americans on a path to success, 1613, 1627
"Meanwhile we have all seen the tragic rise in crime in these communities – which remains one of the greatest barriers to fostering opportunity and success for Americas children." Violent crime rose more than 20% in Los Angeles in 2015, 1627, 1667
Homicides in Baltimore increased by 63%, 1667, 1673
There have been nearly 3000 victims of shootings in Chicago so far this year, 1673, 1687
Government is failing our citizens at every level, 1687, 1695
That is why I am proposing a plan to provide school choice to every disadvantaged student in America, 1695, 1713
That means parents will be able to send their kids to the desired public private or religious school of their choice, 1713, 1734
Here is how it will work, 1734, 1740
Right now about $1.9 billion is spent on fifty private school choice programs nationwide, 1740, 1754
These are opportunity scholarships tax credits and education savings accounts, 1754, 1764
This covers about 400000 students in our country, 1764, 1772
Altogether school choice is serving more than 3.4 million students nationwide, 1772, 1783
Charter schools in particular have demonstrated amazing gains and results in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of these schools will be a top priority for my Administration, 1783, 1813
They also produce competition that causes better outcomes for everyone, 1813, 1823
My first budget will immediately add an additional federal investment of $20 billion towards school choice, 1823, 1839
This will be done by reprioritizing existing federal dollars, 1839, 1848
Specifically my plan will use $20 billion of existing federal dollars to establish a block grant for the 11 million school age kids living in poverty, 1848, 1874
We will give states the option to allow these funds to follow the student to the public or private school they attend, 1874, 1896
Distribution of this grant will favor states that have private school choice and charter laws encouraging them to participate, 1896, 1915
This $20 billion will instantly extend choice to millions more students, 1915, 1926
A state like Ohio will benefit greatly from these new funds, 1926, 1937
Ohio is a leader in school choice, 1937, 1944
Ohio has 5 private school choice programs that serve over 30000 students and 384 charter schools serving 123844 students, 1944, 1963
But the $20 billion is only the beginning, 1963, 1971
As President I will establish the national goal of providing school choice to every American child living in poverty, 1971, 1990
That means that we want every disadvantaged child to be able to choose the local public private charter or magnet school that is best for them and their family, 1990, 2019
Each state will develop its own formula but we want the dollars to follow the student, 2019, 2035
9 in 10 dollars spent on K-12 education is spent at the state and local level, 2035, 2051
To achieve this long-term goal we will have to make this a shared national mission – to bring hope to every child in every city in this land, 2051, 2079
I will use the pulpit of the presidency to campaign for this in all 50 states and I will call upon the American people to elect officials at the city state and federal level who support school choice, 2079, 2117
My Administration will partner with the leadership of any inner city in America – Chicago Baltimore Detroit – that is willing to run a pilot program to provide school choice to every child in that community, 2117, 2153
In Baltimore for instance that would mean more than $15000 funds available per student, 2153, 2167
I am confident that the politicians will not be able to suppress the will of the people anymore, 2167, 2185
If we can put a man on the moon dig out the Panama Canal and win two World Wars then I have no doubt that we as a nation can provide school choice to every disadvantaged child in America, 2185, 2224
If the states collectively contribute another $110 billion of their own education budgets toward school choice on top of the $20 billion in federal dollars that could provide $12000 in school choice funds to every K-12 student who today lives in poverty, 2224, 2266
The money will follow the student, 2266, 2272
That means the student will be able to attend the public private charter or magnet school of their choice – and each state will develop its own system that works best for them, 2272, 2305
"As your President I will be the nations biggest cheerleader for school choice, 2305, 2318
I understand many stale old politicians will resist, 2318, 2326
But its time for our country to start thinking big once again, 2326, 2338
We spend too much time quibbling over the smallest words when we should spend our time dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead." I will also support merit-pay for teachers so that we reward great teachers – instead of the failed tenure system that rewards bad teachers and punishes good ones, 2338, 2390
At the same time we have to ensure that jobs are waiting for our young kids when they graduate high school and college, 2390, 2413
My policies will add millions of new jobs to our country especially for our African-American and Hispanic communities, 2413, 2431
My plan to lift restrictions on the production of American energy will not only make home energy bills cheaper but it will add an estimated half a million jobs per year, 2431, 2462
By reducing radical regulation and over-taxation we can bring thousands of new companies into our poorest communities, 2462, 2479
"Crucially my trade reforms will create a manufacturing revival in America, 2479, 2490
We have a nearly $800 billion dollar annual trade deficit with the world – thats money coming straight out of states like Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan Maine and so many others, 2490, 2520
By ending foreign currency manipulation product dumping and other predatory trading practices we will be able to open thousands of new plants and factories across America." The future is filled with limitless possibilities for our nation and exciting opportunities for our children, 2520, 2562
"All we have to do is cut our ties with the failed politics of the past, 2562, 2578
Weve had a failed foreign policy, 2578, 2584
A failed education policy, 2584, 2588
A failed economic policy, 2588, 2592
And underneath it all a failed political system that rewards politicians for how many donors they have – or how many journalists they know – not how many Americans they help to live better lives." But the failures of the past are about to end, 2592, 2637
Those failures end beginning on November 8th, 2637, 2644
We will have One American Nation, 2644, 2650
We will be One American People, 2650, 2656
We are fighting to give every child in every forgotten stretch of this country the chance to live out their dreams in safety and peace, 2656, 2681
That means a safe neighborhood a quality education and a secure high-paying job, 2681, 2694
This is how we will rebuild our future, 2694, 2702
This is how We Will Make America Great Again – For Everyone, 2702, 2714
Thank you, 2714, 2716
