A 21 year old walked into a gun store in West Columbia South Carolina to purchase a .45-caliber handgun, 7, 26
After three business days the gun was his—legally purchased despite an arrest record that should have prohibited him from ever owning a deadly weapon, 26, 50
Two months after that he used that gun to kill nine Americans in a church in downtown Charleston, 50, 68
That was the year Congress passed the Brady Bill a law that requires every gun store to run a background check with the FBI before someone can purchase a gun, 68, 98
"Its worked—and its blocked more than 2.4 million prohibited gun purchases." When the Brady Bill was being debated the NRA and its allies in Congress managed to squeeze in a loophole: Senator Bernie Sanders then in the U.S, 98, 136
House of Representatives voted for an amendment to to create this loophole—even though he voted against the final Brady Bill, 136, 156
"Without the Charleston loophole in our gun laws the FBI would have had more time to complete a background check from that South Carolina gun store and the Charleston shooter wouldnt have been able to buy his gun." "More than 90 percent of the time the results of a criminal background check come back on the spot, 156, 213
But one time in 10 the FBI sees something they want to investigate further, 213, 227
And if that investigation takes more than three business days the sale can proceed—regardless of a persons criminal record." "Thats really bad news:" "Sometimes a few words in a gun bill can be a matter of life and death, 227, 266
Its time to close this dangerous and deadly loophole—before the next Charleston takes place." , 266, 280
