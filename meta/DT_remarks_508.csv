Its true, 719, 721

The undersecretary of state Patrick Kennedy illegally pressured the FBI to unclassify e-mails from Hillary Clintons illegal server, 735, 753
" n "Its hard to believe, 753, 759
And nothing happens to her folks and nothing ever happens, 759, 769
In other words the State Department was trying to cover up Hillarys crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access, 769, 794
" n The FBI document show that Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a very very serious quid pro quo, 794, 819
Not allowed to do it, 819, 824
This is a felony corruption, 824, 829
Yesterday I said Undersecretary Kennedy must immediately resign, 829, 837

" n "Clinton and her cronies have sacrificed your security your familys safety and your countrys safety as though it meant nothing at all to her, 870, 896
" n Remember also that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying that she never sent or received classified information on her secret server, 896, 920
Right? She never received it on that insecure server that she should have never been allowed to have, 920, 938
That youre not allowed to have, 938, 944
And pretended not to know, 944, 949
Remember this one: that the letter "C" meant confidential information was classified, 949, 961

And the Department of Justice there must be people in there that are ashamed absolutely ashamed of whats been going on.n" "Hillary then told the FBI she couldnt remember 39 times, 1008, 1039

Bad memory, 1057, 1059
Shes got a terrible memory, 1059, 1064

The disappearance of 13 iPhones some by hammers two boxes of e-mail evidence gone missing that was as of last week, 1079, 1100
Can you imagine theyre now missing on top of everything else two boxes of e-mails? And the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI, 1100, 1127

But you dont hear the media talking about that at all do you? You dont see it at all, 1195, 1214
As WikiLeaks proved the media is merely and it truly is its just an extension of the Clinton campaign, 1214, 1233

Its lying down going to sleep, 1611, 1617
I think the medias trying to discourage our people from going out to vote, 1617, 1631
And it was just brought up to me by a reporter in the back.n" They said you know its very interesting when you were fighting 17 people the media was nasty but they really got nasty when we started to take the lead in the polls, 1631, 1677

Its going to happen."n "Change stop our jobs from leaving our companies from leaving strengthen our military preserve our Second Amendment, 1687, 1708

He said lets face it—this is in the New York Times "balance has been on vacation since Mr, 1858, 1876
Trump stepped onto this golden Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy."n "Can you believe that? Theyre admitting it, 1876, 1895

And I hear were going great in Colorado, 2127, 2135
My people in back said "Youre going to win Colorado doesnt matter what they say."  n Get out and vote, 2135, 2155
But they even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt, 2155, 2175

And were not supposed to talk about it, 2337, 2345
And your Republican leaders said "Oh this—everything is peachy-dory" right? And it also found non-citizen voting may have given Democrats the pivotal sixtieth vote needed to pass Obamacare, 2345, 2373
Its a Washington policy not me.n "The system is also rigged by the donors giving hundreds of millions of dollars to Crooked Hillarys campaign, 2373, 2397

Well they pressed the wrong button and congratulations we have 1800 new citizens of the United States.n" And when I said "undo it" they said that wouldnt be constitutional, 2899, 2928
Hey folks how stupid are we being led? The time for congressional term limits has finally arrived, 2928, 2945
Not only will it end our government corruption but we will end the economic stagnation that were in right now, 2945, 2965
No growth.n My plan for the economy can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 2965, 2984

Colorado has lost one in seven manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA and a deal supported by Hillary Clinton very strongly.n "And this I thought was a typographical error because I figured they meant 700 or 7000 but it wasnt: Weve lost 70000 factories since Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization, 3069, 3122
Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster.n" "We are living through the greatest job theft in the history of the world, 3122, 3142

We let our companies go so foolishly, 3156, 3163
We dont know what were doing, 3163, 3169
A Trump administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA stand up to the foreign cheating and stop the jobs from leaving our country and have jobs come back in the other direction, 3169, 3200

She said "nobody cares." And youre right they dont seem too, 3325, 3336
So to those African-Americans suffering to those Latinos suffering I say: What do you have to lose? Elect Donald Trump, 3336, 3356
I will fix it, 3356, 3360
We will fix it, 3360, 3364

Were going to get a very big African-American vote, 3369, 3378
Were going to get a very big Latino vote, 3378, 3387
Because the Democrats come in they want your vote, 3387, 3396
And as soon as you give them the vote they say "See you in four years." They dont do anything, 3396, 3416
Its gotten worse and worse for both the African-Americans the Latino-Hispanics, 3416, 3427
Its gotten worse and it will only get worse.n They want your vote, 3427, 3440
Hillary Clinton said she was going to fix up the state of New York when she ran for the Senate, 3440, 3460
It is a total disaster, 3460, 3465

There go your jobs; and open borders—there goes your country, 3520, 3530
Simple as that.n "There are already a record 65 million people in the United States who speak a language other than English, 3530, 3552
Its in their interest and everyones interest to control immigration so past arrivals can integrate into society and really join the middle class and the upper class.n" But in a secret speech to Goldman Sachs she said "Citizens who want to control immigration are un-American." In other words if you want to have a border you want to have a wall which creates a country, 3552, 3617
Even if you want people to come in but come in through a legal process she considers that un-American, 3617, 3636
So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable irredeemable un-American racist or basement dwellers in the case of the Bernie Sanders people, 3636, 3660
She said they were basement dwellers, 3660, 3666
Hillarys plan includes an open border with the Middle East meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.n "We will be the great Trojan horse folks, 3666, 3696

Well also stop the crisis of illegal immigration, 3821, 3829

ICE was just last week, 3872, 3877
As secretary of state Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries would not take them back, 3877, 3900
They were too evil, 3900, 3904
They were too evil drug lords heads of gangs, 3904, 3913
I mean these people were evil, 3913, 3919
They wouldnt take them back.n" "So we come over we bring they wont take them back, 3919, 3935
Oh take them back drop them on the streets, 3935, 3944
And then you wonder why the murder rate is the highest in 45 years and other things.n" The ICE officer described Hillarys proposal as quote "The most radical immigration proposal in U.S, 3944, 3976
history." Heres a summary of the Hillary plan, 3976, 3984
She wants to support sanctuary cities.n She wants Social Security Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens, 3984, 4006
They get taken care of better than our great vets, 4006, 4016

You see whats going on, 4035, 4040

No deportation of Visa overstays, 4041, 4046
Expanding catch-and-release on the border, 4046, 4051
She wants it expanded, 4051, 4055
In other words catch them and say "Oh you can go."n "Expanding President Obamas unconstitutional executive amnesty including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers, 4055, 4081
Freeing even—there go your jobs—freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obamas non-enforcement directives.n" And this is to me the beauty of them all, 4081, 4105
Obama has allowed thousands and thousands and thousands of people to come in Syrians from the Middle East, 4105, 4123
She wants an increase of 550 percent in Syrian refugees into our country, 4123, 4136
