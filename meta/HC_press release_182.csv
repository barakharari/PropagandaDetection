Why these Georgians cast a vote for Hillary on Super Tuesday—in their own words, 0, 14
My mother came from Africa to here just on faith alone, 14, 25
All she had in her pocket was her faith that we were going to have a better life if we came to America, 25, 48
And she said were gonna make a better life and she put her best foot forward, 48, 64
And here we are 30 years later, 64, 71
It takes one person just to say "Hey I can make a change" and then the rest follows, 71, 89
I didnt speak English my mother didnt speak English and look where we are now, 89, 104
She just registered to vote last year so this will be her first time to vote, 104, 120
And it will be so historic being able to vote for the first woman president, 120, 135
I think my mother is one of the strongest people I know, 135, 147
I look up to her, 147, 152
No matter how life punches her or knocks her down she always gets up and she never feels sorry or pity for herself, 152, 175
"Its going to be three generations voting, 175, 182
Thats amazing, 182, 184
My girls are 22 and 23 so they can actually vote this time, 184, 197
Its going to be quite a moment for us—from apartheid to America from racism to equality womens rights voting rights, 197, 217
Its amazing to think that if we stop and say hey look lets just take one step at a time one foot in front of another well get somewhere, 217, 246
Slowly but surely." Being a woman being a grandmother being a mother—its very important to have someone who understands us and who knows where we want to go and where we have been, 246, 279
When President Obama ran I was passionate, 279, 286
But Hillary has just lit that fire inside me to want to say "You know what? It is time to stand for something." "Im confessing right now: There is a co-worker I have who is male who hasnt been working where I work for as long as I have and I recently found out he was getting paid more than me, 286, 347
Yeah—I was shocked, 347, 350
Hillary is fighting for equal pay, 350, 356
And Im fighting for equal pay." "Its just going to be so huge, 356, 369
I wasnt old enough to vote for Hillary when she was first running in 2008, 369, 384
I was telling my friends that they all had to get out and vote." "I know President Obama is black and Im an African-American female but for women this is huge and I think for me to see a woman on that ballot and for me to just go vote for Hillary Im just going to throw my heels off." You go girl! " I love to hear the issues and I volunteer getting other people out to vote, 384, 463
Ive done 20 hours of calling and then I hope to canvass in my region, 463, 478
Even though I cant vote I just love to be involved in politics." " I actually take him with me when we go to vote so that he can see the process, 478, 510
We talk about it, 510, 514
Most of our views are the same sometimes they are a little different, 514, 527
But at least hes been exposed to it and he can make up his mind for himself, 527, 544
Patrick just seems to have a passion for it, 544, 553
Ive always been interested in it but you know when its just yourself its kind of hard to drum up the enthusiasm, 553, 575
When you have a child excited about it you get excited about it and you get more involved in the process itself, 575, 597
When he got me involved I thought man this is kind of fun." " Hillary wants to put money toward Alzheimers research, 597, 619
Patricks grandmother has Alzheimers so its something that hits home, 619, 629
Its hard, 629, 631
Its awful when you see a great mind just wasting away, 631, 642
I just hope this is the next step toward finding a cure—and its important to our family that Hillarys fighting for this too." "Well Ive never had any doubt otherwise—I was supporting her from the beginning even in 2008, 642, 681
Hillary has always shown a desire to help the downtrodden or help people in general, 681, 696
And I just thought from the beginning that she had the best chance to win the presidency and be a good president." "The people that Im thinking about are the next Supreme Court justices, 696, 730
That really is the most important thing in my mind, 730, 740
Our next president selects the next Supreme Court justices, 740, 749
And if its a Republican we get a staunch diehard conservative Supreme Court, 749, 762
And all of our rights that weve gained till now will be gradually just stripped away." "Oh Lord thats a horrible thought." "Well probably the thing thats going through my mind is Obamacare will probably get repealed provided that the House and Senate remain Republican, 762, 807
So well probably lose Obamacare and go into chaos over what will replace it, 807, 821
We will have eventually higher taxes and all our civil rights and civil liberties will be restricted more than they are, 821, 842
But the Supreme Court—that scares me more than anything." "Yes—unfortunately it was not for the greatest reasons but because of September 11, 842, 864
My dads from Iran and hes a Muslim, 864, 872
So in high school people didnt say the nicest things calling me a terrorist calling me that to identify me as something that they thought my father was, 872, 900
And so because of a lot of discrimination I went through I turned to politics to understand what is going on in the world and in the media and why people are saying these heinous things about me, 900, 938
And I took the time to study all the parties to see which ones my identity and my beliefs fit, 938, 958
My dads a Democrat but my moms a Republican and I thought that being a Democrat fit for the majority of people—the people who dont have a voice the people who dont speak English the people who are coming here because America is a land of opportunity." Laughs, 958, 1006
"My mom was not as in-your-face about it as my dad, 1006, 1017
But it was great, 1017, 1021
It was very open—we always talked about things that were going on within the government to keep us educated, 1021, 1040
My dad grew up in Iran but he learned a lot about the American government and how the system works, 1040, 1060
And he thought it was really important for his kids to understand that and be involved and have a voice and express how we feel about whats going on in our country, 1060, 1092
And my moms family is from Cuba—so to have that freedom to do that is not something they were able to do, 1092, 1114
So its something they take advantage of and instilled that into us and really let us be who we want to be, 1114, 1136
Ive been a Democrat but its because I was able to choose that and figure out who I am within this society." " All my life, 1136, 1162
My father was in the Georgia legislature when I was a child, 1162, 1174
It was an interesting time—there were a lot of issues around integration and my dad fought to keep public schools open, 1174, 1195
That kind of set the pace and my outlook and views on helping the underserved, 1195, 1210
And Ive always been a Democrat." "And now Celia my granddaughter is about to turn 10 years old—but she has always been engaged in current affairs and whats going on, 1210, 1240
This is part of being a person a citizen—someone who cares about other people." " I feel like she has so much experience on the global stage, 1240, 1267
And thats just important to everybody abroad and at home, 1267, 1277
I dont think we need a novice trying to figure out how things work, 1277, 1291
We just need civil dialogue, 1291, 1296
We need to work together."  That would be awesome! I think she would be a great president, 1296, 1313
I really like our country the way it is, 1313, 1322
But if Hillary were running it it would be even better, 1322, 1333
" Well I didnt think there wouldnt be a woman president in my lifetime—after all Margaret Thatcher was elected in the U.K, 1333, 1355
all those years ago, 1355, 1359
But for Celia I think all doors are open to her already because she knows that theyre open and she can follow her dreams, 1359, 1383
But everything like this makes it a little bit easier." , 1383, 1393
