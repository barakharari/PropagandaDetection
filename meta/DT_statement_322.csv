Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father shot at by a Palestinian terrorist was killed while driving his car and three of his children who were passengers were severely injured, 0, 33
As I did with regard to the brutal murder of Hallel Yaffa Ariel I strongly condemn this attack and call upon the Palestinian leadership to completely end this barbaric behavior, 33, 63
I also call upon President Obama to recognize and condemn each and every terrorist attack against Israeli citizens, 63, 81
This cannot become the "new normal." It has to end, 81, 91
