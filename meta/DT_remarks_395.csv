" n Amazing, 22, 25
Amazing, 25, 26
What great people.n "Were going to bring back our jobs to Pennsylvania, 26, 38
Were going to bring back our jobs to the United States, 38, 49
" n "Going to bring back our jobs folks, 49, 58
Ive looked at the numbers and I see whats happening in Pennsylvania, 58, 70
I see whats happening all over our country.n" "You look at New York state you look at New England you look anywhere in the country where you want to go to all over its the same, 70, 106
Manufacturing way down jobs way down, 106, 112
You go to other countries theyre taking our companies theyre taking our jobs.n" "People are right now working harder than theyve ever worked, 112, 135
Eighteen years ago they made more money in real wages 18 years think of it, 135, 150
Eighteen years ago many of the people in this incredibly big room and thank you for being here you know its 93 degrees out, 150, 174
" n "And they still have a lot of people trying to get in I dont know if they can get them in, 174, 197
Should we let them in? Just let them in, 197, 206
" n "But 18 years ago people were making more money in real wages than they make today, 206, 224
And today theyre working two jobs some people are working three jobs, 224, 236
So theyre older and theyre working harder and theyre making less money all right? A friend of mine Ive been telling this story over the last month because its better than going to Wharton or better than going to Harvard and asking them to do a study because you learn it in three minutes.n" "But let me just tell you, 236, 296
Right now Mexico and other countries are building facilities plants the likes of which youve never seen, 296, 313
Were going to build the wall dont worry were going to build the wall were going to build it were going to build it, 313, 337
" n "But a friend of mine and actually a supporter big supporter great guy, 337, 352
He builds plants thats what he does he builds plants, 352, 362
He doesnt want to build apartments he doesnt want to build office buildings he wants to build plants, 362, 380
And hes just about the biggest there is, 380, 388
And I said how are things going? He said very well how are you doing in the U.S.? Not good, 388, 408
How are you doing in Mexico?n" "He said Donald do you want to see its the eighth wonder of the world, 408, 429
They are building plants the likes of which Ive never seen, 429, 440
Hes building some of the greatest plants big—you look at Ford moving vast operations to Mexico, 440, 456
The plants, 456, 458
You look at—look at take a look, 458, 465
By the way millions of jobs thousands of companies over the years theyve left us, 465, 480
And we have a few things, 480, 486
We have unemployment we have empty plants I saw up in New York state I saw it in Pennsylvania you were great to meet you voted a big victory for Donald Trump thank you, 486, 520
" n "That was a big victory, 520, 527
I mean I assumed I was going—if I dont win Pennsylvania—and by the way I was talking to our great Congressman and where is he? Hes here some place where is he? " n "He loves the people and I have to say of all of Pennsylvania he wants to see this state do well, 527, 582
Thank you, 582, 584
But just talking back to a few of my friends that live here we have a few of the friends and we see whats happened with General Electric where theyre cutting way back, 584, 617
Not going to happen, 617, 621
And you know why theyre cutting back its one reason, 621, 631
Because we dont take care of our miners and were not producing coal.n" "And they dont need to make those big big beautiful you could call them locomotives I guess right? Whatever the hell they are theyre big and theyre powerful and they dont need them like they used to because we dont make our government work for us, 631, 690
Theyre not working for us, 690, 695
Theyre working for others theyre not working for us, 695, 704
So when General Electric goes out and you see the numbers I see the numbers and its about coal so I just left parts of Virginia and West Virginia and the coal industrys decimated.n" "The miners are out of work theyre totally out of work, 704, 749
I mean there will be no such thing as coal in this country pretty soon, 749, 764
And were talking clean coal were talking clean coal.n" "So I was with the miners we have such tremendous support West Virginia the mining parts of Virginia, 764, 791
All over Ohio because Hillary Clinton made the statement not so long ago, 791, 804
A number of months she said were going to put the mines and miners out of business, 804, 821
All right? Going to put the mines and the miners – so " n "So were not going to let that happen, 821, 843
Were not going to let that happen and were not going to let it happen in Pennsylvania because you know what? A lot of your miners have already lost their jobs but you have a lot of other jobs that are very reliant on the mines, 843, 889
Like as an example General Electric, 889, 895
And what were going to do folks is going to be so special, 895, 908
Were going to bring it back, 908, 914
Were going to bring back our jobs were going to bring back our companies, 914, 928
" n "When a company wants to leave our country to go to another country and think theyre going to make their product and because our politicians are weak stupid taken care of by lobbyists special interests—theyre taken care of by lobbyists theyre taken care of by donors and special interests, 928, 979
Thats what—you know a friend of mine—very smart guy—said—I cant believe it, 979, 991
Were talking about a deal that took place about a month ago.n" "He said I cant believe they could have gotten that through, 991, 1014
I said Why cant you believe it? Well its so bad for the country, 1014, 1028
I said Yeah but its good for the politician because theyre taken care of by their lobbyists and their donors and the special interests.n" "So even though you say we want as an example General Electric to produce more if they dont want to or if for some reason one of the donors of crooked Hillary Clinton doesnt want that to happen even though its great for Erie even though its great you even though its great for the state of Pennsylvania then its not going to happen folks, 1028, 1117
Its not going to happen.n" "And by the way—and I have to tell you this, 1117, 1132
So when they think theyre going to take our companies are rip them out of—as an example—this area or this state or any other state and go to Mexico and build massive new plants and employ people other than you and youre going to lose your jobs or youre going to now get two part- time jobs that dont add up to half of what you used to make, 1132, 1201
That stuff isnt happening anymore, 1201, 1206
So heres what happens, 1206, 1210
Theyre going to build that plant, 1210, 1216
Now if I were here five years ago and if President Obama put me and maybe secretary of keeping business in the United States—thats my title secretary of keeping business in the United States, 1216, 1250
" n "I mean I like the sound of secretary of defense better, 1250, 1263
Oh and by the way were going to build our military, 1263, 1274
Were going to be very strong, 1274, 1280
" n "Really, 1280, 1283
And were going to take care of our vets, 1283, 1292
Were going to take care of our vets believe me, 1292, 1302
" n "But I like the sound—I like the sound of secretary of Defense, 1302, 1316
I like the sound of secretary of the Treasury, 1316, 1325
I like the sound of secretary of State, 1325, 1333
But Ill tell you would I be good at keeping jobs over here, 1333, 1346
Would I be.., 1346, 1349
" n "Ill tell you this, 1349, 1355
I just have to say the Bernie Sanders protesters were much much stronger, 1355, 1368
They had much more passion I have to say, 1368, 1377
" n "All right, 1377, 1381
You know whats interesting? If I could speak to them for like five minutes—we want a strong military we want to take care of our people we want good education we want good housing we want good healthcare, 1381, 1419
What do we want? Were all in for the same thing, 1419, 1430
" n "Really amazing, 1430, 1434
Really amazing, 1434, 1436
So Ill be your secretary of keeping companies in the United States right? So I would go to a company like Carrier Air Conditioner which decided to leave Indianapolis Indiana and I would say heres the story.n" "We think its wonderful that youre negotiating with Mexico, 1436, 1482
Im sure youre going to have a wonderful plant but heres whats going to happen, 1482, 1497
If you build that plant and you fire all of these people 1400 people who were so great to me.n" "Indiana I won that in a landslide, 1497, 1524
Actually the timing was good, 1524, 1529
I won it in a landslide because I know what to do, 1529, 1541
Hillary doesnt know what to do, 1541, 1547
Did you see her yesterday? She has no clue about what were talking about, 1547, 1561
Folks she has no clue, 1561, 1566
She has no clue, 1566, 1570
Crooked Hillary, 1570, 1572
She doesnt know anything about it and by the way if she did she couldnt do it anyway because her donors dont want to do it, 1572, 1598
Theres reasons.n" "But look look, 1598, 1603
I would go to them and say just to keep them, 1603, 1614
Just to keep them, 1614, 1618
And I wouldnt even care that much, 1618, 1625
Ill tell you why, 1625, 1629
Ready? Id say heres the story.n" "If you leave in this case Indianapolis youre going to go to Mexico youre going to make your air conditioning units, 1629, 1656
Every single unit that you make that crosses our now very very strong border were going to charge you 35 percent of the cost of that unit, 1656, 1683
OK? Thirty five percent, 1683, 1687
Right?n" "So simple, 1687, 1690
Thirty five percent the cost of that unit, 1690, 1698
We hope you enjoy your new plant, 1698, 1705
Very hot weather out there very hot, 1705, 1712
We hope you enjoy your new plant but 35 percent is coming to us, 1712, 1726
Now heres whats going to happen if they havent moved yet, 1726, 1737
A lot of them have moved.n" "Weve lost thousands and thousands of companies weve lost millions of jobs - too late, 1737, 1758
I should have been there 10 years ago, 1758, 1766
Nobody would have left, 1766, 1770
Nobody would have left because you need the right messenger you know Im your messenger in terms of this movement.n" "But you need the right person saying it, 1770, 1798
So heres whats going to happen, 1798, 1804
Normally theyd call up whoever it is that was putting the little order down like the new president and theyd have one of their lobbyists call up and theyd say Hillary Im sorry you cant do that they gave you $2 million for your campaign, 1804, 1849
Cant do that Hillary, 1849, 1853
OK I wont do that.n" "With me Im putting my money up folks, 1853, 1866
Im putting my money up, 1866, 1871
Putting my money up, 1871, 1875
Were raising money for Reince and for the RNC but thats for a lot of other reasons, 1875, 1892
We are putting - Im putting a lot of money up, 1892, 1903
I financed my - I funded not financed I wish I financed right? I funded but I funded my primaries and I spent less than anybody else in terms of the measures, 1903, 1935
So heres a story - wouldnt that be nice?n" "I spent less and won in a landslide, 1935, 1952
Other people spent much much more, 1952, 1958
Three four five times more and they came in seventh, 1958, 1968
Who the hell do you want to have as your president right? Right? Right? Oh boy and then they dont like me - couple of them most of them have really supported us but some of them just cant get over it, 1968, 2010
You know what I say to them? Get over it, 2010, 2020
Were just having fun, 2020, 2024
Get over it.n" "You signed a pledge I hereby guarantee that I will endorse whoever wins - you know the funny thing all those pledges you know they were signed for different - they were signed so that I would sign it, 2024, 2066
And I would have honored it I will say, 2066, 2075
Even if I wasnt fond or didnt like - I would have honored it because a pledge is a very important thing, 2075, 2097
But heres the thing, 2097, 2101
So we are going to take these companies that havent left - now Im looking at your numbers folks youre not doing too well.n" "Youre not doing too well here, 2101, 2131
Pennsylvania has lost one in three manufacturing jobs since - you know thats massive since NAFTA, 2131, 2147
NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton and I believe its the single worst trade document ever signed in the history of our country and probably in the history of our world.n" "Its one of the most one-sided documents that Ive ever seen, 2147, 2189
And it allowed Mexico and places to do unbelievably well at our expense, 2189, 2202
And did you see where say Im going to renegotiate NAFTA Im going to—TPP disaster, 2202, 2217
Ok dont worry, 2217, 2220
Dont worry.n" "And Hillary was in favor of TPP, 2220, 2229
She said its the gold standard, 2229, 2235
Thank you for reminding me, 2235, 2240
I like this guy, 2240, 2244
Its the gold standard, 2244, 2248
TPP, 2248, 2249
Transpacific Partnership, 2249, 2251
It is going to be—I dont think you can be worse than NAFTA honestly, 2251, 2265
But its going to be as bad as NAFTA, 2265, 2274
So TPP she said it is the gold standard, 2274, 2283
Shes reading it from a teleprompter, 2283, 2289
It is the gold standard—oh boy, 2289, 2295
Our country is in trouble, 2295, 2300
Our country is in trouble, 2300, 2305
Our country is in trouble.n" "So she said its the gold standard, 2305, 2317
But when she heard me make a speech as I understand it, 2317, 2329
And she heard me talking very negatively about it, 2329, 2338
As an example they dont talk devaluation which is the single greatest tool that these countries are using to kill the United States including China, 2338, 2363
They devalue their currency, 2363, 2367
Well it doesnt happen, 2367, 2371
Number one thing is not mentioned.n" "So complicated this agreement, 2371, 2381
Too many countries, 2381, 2384
By the way I believe trade, 2384, 2390
I believe in trade deals, 2390, 2395
One country at a time, 2395, 2400
Boom, 2400, 2401
Boom, 2401, 2402
Boom, 2402, 2403
You got to see the lines, 2403, 2409
Well have one line, 2409, 2413
And if they dont do well.n" "If they dont behave themselves if they want to start devaluing their currency all over the place very simple we write them a notice like we do in business, 2413, 2448
We serve them with a 30 day notice, 2448, 2456
" n And by the way you just saw how great are our police right?  n "Law and order, 2456, 2475
We need law and order, 2475, 2480
We need law and order and we will have law and order, 2480, 2492
Our police our firemen - but our police do a fantastic job, 2492, 2504
They are not recognized for the great job they do, 2504, 2514
If they have 500000 incidents all positively beautifully handled one bad thing happens that one bad thing is on the news for two weeks and its a disgrace, 2514, 2542
Its a disgrace.n" "So we should be very thankful for the job they do, 2542, 2556
So Pennsylvania is losing a lot of its business, 2556, 2565
Right now were sitting here were talking - oh heres another one, 2565, 2577
Go home to Mom, 2577, 2581
Go home to Mom, 2581, 2585
" n "And your mother is voting for trump! Shes voting for Trump, 2585, 2598
Its true, 2598, 2600
Its true.n" "By the way just to interject - so I was told this whole area is Democratic meaning Democrat, 2600, 2620
And I was told that by a lot of different people outside and then they said I cant believe that you have 10000 people you have people outside trying to get in.n" "They said the came up to me this is - happens to be a Democrat who I happen to know is a good guy—came up to me and said Ive never seen anything like it, 2620, 2687
It always goes Democrat, 2687, 2691
Is that a correct statement? Said you are going to win Erie in a and the surrounding area - youre going to win in a landslide, 2691, 2717
Gonna be a landslide, 2717, 2721
" n "Because people are tired of lies theyre tired of losing their jobs theyre tired of seeing their companies being ripped out and going to other places, 2721, 2749
Theyre tired of China coming in and dropping steel all over the place to put your companies out of business so we have to go to China to get our steel which is happening very quickly.n" "And thats why the steel workers are with me thats why the miners are with me thats why the working people electricians the plumbers the sheetrockers the concrete guys and gals theyre all - theyre with us.n" "And I grew up you know they say you know youre really rich how come you sort of relate to these people? Well my father built houses and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians I got to know all these people I got to know the plumbers the steamfitters—I got to know them all.n" "And I liked them better than the rich people that I know, 2749, 2896
I know a lot of rich people, 2896, 2903
Its true, 2903, 2905
Theyre better, 2905, 2907
I like them better.n" "So anyway—and we are going to put people back to work, 2907, 2922
Were not playing games, 2922, 2926
And its going to go quickly, 2926, 2932
By the way its going to go quickly.n" "But look at this OK, 2932, 2945
So Erie has lost one in three manufacturing jobs, 2945, 2954
You know that all I—you do—I flew over youre looking at the plants plants that 25 years ago 20 years ago 15 years ago some two years ago were vibrant.n" "But no plant two years ago was too vibrant because it was down to half down to a quarter down to a tenth and then ultimately they closed but you see them, 2954, 3016
They are falling over, 3016, 3020
The rain the sleet the snow the wind, 3020, 3028
These are great buildings that are falling apart, 3028, 3036
Dont feel bad all over the country, 3036, 3043
Upstate New York is a disaster which Hillary Clinton said that she was going to fix.n" "OK so the Washington Post is extraordinarily dishonest and thats fine, 3043, 3070
But they wrote a story I couldnt believe I saw this story they talked about Hillary Clinton, 3070, 3087
It was a headline Hillary Clinton and when she ran for the United States Senator from New York she said to the people in upstate New York which was starting to really have problems because of her husbands bill NAFTA.n" "And companies were leaving tremendous unemployment tremendous problems making nothing and she said I will turn it around I will create 200000 jobs were going to do a great job, 3087, 3157
Guess what? She got elected she did nothing, 3157, 3165
And the only ones that benefited were the consultants and the people that helped her out, 3165, 3181
It is a disaster, 3181, 3185
upstate New York is right now worse than anything you have in the state of Pennsylvania she did nothing.n" And I watched her yesterday which was hard to do because she is boring OK?  n "I watched her yesterday talking about—you know whats funny? I said Im going to renegotiate NAFTA and they said what happens if you cant make a deal I said were going to terminate were getting out, 3185, 3256
And " n "So Ive been saying that and Ive been saying were going to renegotiate different trade deals and were going to make great trade deals and all this and shes never said that, 3256, 3291
All of a sudden two days ago I will renegotiate trade deals, 3291, 3303
Shes not going to do it folks, 3303, 3310
Shes going to renegotiate trade deals the same way she was going to put 200000 jobs in upstate New York.n" "It turned out to be a total fantasy and I have to tell you I respect the Washington Post for writing one bad story, 3310, 3354
Because you what theyre doing? And Reince was alluding to it a little bit the only way she gets elected is if they dont report on her, 3354, 3381
They dont show her, 3381, 3385
They have me on so much television, 3385, 3392
Theres CNN you talk about dishonesty its called the Clinton—wait—its called the Clinton News Network CNN, 3392, 3408
Now think of it Clinton is" n "Shes hardly ever on, 3408, 3419
So yesterday they have yesterday a scandal with the emails another one, 3419, 3431
Im not talking about the 33000 emails that she deleted or got rid of, 3431, 3445
Can you imagine what was on those emails? Can you imagine? I love that, 3445, 3459
Can you imagine what was on those emails 33000 emails were deleted, 3459, 3471
And she said well it had to do with the wedding and yoga.n" "I give two to yoga I give five to the wedding, 3471, 3495
Ill tell you the lies the deception, 3495, 3502
Were running like they run right now a third world country folks OK? You saw what happened its running like a third world country were being talked about all over the world nobody can believe it.n" In fact when they were going over the charges against Hillary Clinton one after another after another after another however and yet other people their lives have been destroyed for doing much less all right?n "Their lives have been destroyed, 3502, 3578
So now they have a big scandal in New York, 3578, 3588
Its in the New York papers but very little, 3588, 3597
Pay right? Pay for play, 3597, 3602
And its horrifying its horrifying, 3602, 3607
Our government is for sale, 3607, 3612
Our government is for sale by a crooked person, 3612, 3621
And what theyre doing is theyre trying to not talk about her, 3621, 3633
Take a look, 3633, 3636
You go to CNN as an example, 3636, 3643
Story after story about Trump, 3643, 3648
Story—Trump, 3648, 3649
Trump, 3649, 3650
Trump, 3650, 3651
Trump.n" "And yesterday it was announced that people are tired of negative—the hit jobs and CNNs starting to do very poorly, 3651, 3672
Thats good, 3672, 3674
I like that, 3674, 3677
I like that, 3677, 3680
And I have to say Fox has been treating us fairly, 3680, 3691
Fox has been fair, 3691, 3695
But CNN has been catastrophic, 3695, 3700
Its so dishonest.n" "But somebody was explaining to me their theory, 3700, 3711
If they dont report on her people arent going to know how bad she is, 3711, 3726
Look at her news conference, 3726, 3731
She hasnt had a news conference in like 260 days, 3731, 3741
That last one wasnt a news conference, 3741, 3748
That was a few of her friends, 3748, 3755
They asked her a question, 3755, 3760
What did she say about the circuit right? Let me tell you if I ever said that short- circuited if I ever said I short-circuited it would be headlines all over the world, 3760, 3793
They would call for the death penalty, 3793, 3800
" n Can you imagine if I said that I short-circuited? I mean I stand up here for months in front of massive crowds she gets 300 people going to her events, 3800, 3832
She gets 300 people and then she reads something from a teleprompter and then she leaves and she goes home and she goes to sleep, 3832, 3857
 n "And then she wakes and she goes again, 3857, 3866
And Im telling you—and nobody does anything about it, 3866, 3875
Now me I stand up here—Im not looking at notes, 3875, 3885
Im not reading teleprompters, 3885, 3889
Not easy, 3889, 3891
Not easy, 3891, 3893
Not easy, 3893, 3895
" n But—but—remember—but—and if I make one mistake  " say he mention something wrong, 3895, 3909
He got a wrong date, 3909, 3914
Its like headlines all over, 3914, 3919
She can say she short-circuited up here, 3919, 3926
I dont want a president who short-circuits, 3926, 3933
Is that OK? I dont want it, 3933, 3940
I dont want a president who short-circuits, 3940, 3947
" n "Weve got to deal with ISIS, 3947, 3955
Weve got to deal with China, 3955, 3961
Weve got to deal with lots of people, 3961, 3969
Theyre not short-circuiting, 3969, 3972
But I dont want somebody that short-circuits, 3972, 3979
So let me just tell you—let me just tell you.n" "Over the last little while—you know every time its always a big deal, 3979, 4002
When I said that Obama—and of course Im being sarcastic, 4002, 4012
And they know that because after I said that I said hes the MVP hes going to collect his MVP award, 4012, 4033
OK.n" So I said Obama is the founder of ISIS, 4033, 4043
The founder, 4043, 4045
 n "And these dishonest media people—theyre the most dishonest people, 4045, 4055
They said oh did he mean that? Didnt he mean that? And after that Id say a lot—in fact they like him so much because hes been so weak and so bad, 4055, 4087
I mean he let this happen, 4087, 4093
They had eight states, 4093, 4097
They had eight countries, 4097, 4101
Theyre now in 28 countries, 4101, 4106
Theyre expanding.n" "So I said the founder of—obviously Im being sarcastic, 4106, 4117
Then—then—but not that sarcastic to be honest with you, 4117, 4126
" n "And they all said he should not say that, 4126, 4137
They should call him an enabler, 4137, 4143
Call him an enabler, 4143, 4147
Hes an enabler, 4147, 4150
I said that doesnt sound the same, 4150, 4157
Hes an enabler, 4157, 4160
People are going to say whats—these people are the worst, 4160, 4170
But listen so I said the founder of ISIS, 4170, 4179
And in fact very soon hes going over to pick up his most valuable player award, 4179, 4195
Did I say that? I say it all the time, 4195, 4205
TRUMP: So they knew I was being sarcastic, 4205, 4213
By now theyre analyzing, 4213, 4217
Did I really mean that? How could I say that? These people are the lowest form of life, 4217, 4235
Im telling you, 4235, 4238
The lowest, 4238, 4240
" n They are the lowest form of humanity, 4240, 4249
Not all of them, 4249, 4253
They have about 25 percent that are pretty good actually, 4253, 4263
But most of them.n "OK, 4263, 4268
So heres the story, 4268, 4272
So Erie has lost a lot, 4272, 4278
Right? You know that right? Hang in dont leave, 4278, 4287
I promise we can fix it so fast, 4287, 4295
We will stop these countries from taking our jobs, 4295, 4304
We will stop these countries from taking our companies, 4304, 4313
Hold on.n" "Our jobs will come back, 4313, 4320
Now I came up with a great plan, 4320, 4328
Im lowering corporate taxes so our companies stay so I dont even have to make the call, 4328, 4345
The corporate inversions - you know we have companies that have they say two and a half trillion dollars outside of our comp - they cant get their money back, 4345, 4375
We dont let them.n" Everybody agrees that we should do it, 4375, 4386
Republicans Democrats everybody agrees.n "Whats the - look why do we not want them to bring money back? You know why? Because we dont have a president that can sit the leaders of both parties around a table and in about five minutes let them say lets bring this money back in so we can work it in this country right?n" "Thats what it is, 4386, 4451
So were going to bring that money back in were going to lower taxes were going to keep our companies - and if our companies want to leave theyre going to pay a nice big beautiful tax to get their product back in.n" "OK? Thats whats going to happen, 4451, 4500
So the existing U.S, 4500, 4504
trade deficit with TPP participating nations has already cost Pennsylvania 68000 jobs folks, 4504, 4517
No more folks.n" "Were not going to be stupid people any more were going to be the really really smart people, 4517, 4538
Its going to be America first, 4538, 4544
America first, 4544, 4546
America first, 4546, 4548
First, 4548, 4549
" n "So the destruction of manufacturing in Pennsylvania was caused by Hillary Clintons and her husbands disastrous trade policies.n" "I mean you take a look at what shes done, 4549, 4579
At the bidding of her corporate funders Hillary Clinton has backed every job-killing trade deal for decades, 4579, 4596
She has received so much money she has approved virtually every tax increase put before her.n" "Yesterday - you see 1.3 trillion in tax increases, 4596, 4621
Were the highest taxed nation in the land essentially, 4621, 4630
Were the highest taxed nation in the world, 4630, 4638
Anywhere in the world.n" "And of the industrialized nations were far and away the highest taxed nation, 4638, 4655
And shes proposing a massive tax increase, 4655, 4662
Folks we cant do it, 4662, 4667
Its going to make our country non-competitive - its already non-competitive.n" "Its going to make our country non-competitive and were not going to do it, 4667, 4692
Im proposing a massive tax decrease for the middle class for business and businesses are going to pour in - not since Ronald Reagan has anything like this been proposed.n" "Businesses instead of leaving because their taxes are so high theyre going to stay, 4692, 4736
I might not even have to make those calls, 4736, 4745
Now if I do I will meaning my people will, 4745, 4755
Ill do some I love doing it, 4755, 4762
I would love telling some guy youre not moving, 4762, 4771
Well Mr, 4771, 4773
President sir we would like to move to Mexico, 4773, 4782
Youre not moving and if you do you pay the 35 percent tax, 4782, 4795
You say Well in that case Im not moving Im not moving, 4795, 4807
In that case Im not moving, 4807, 4813
So easy.n" "So your coal industry your steel industry which has been ravaged your General Electrics of the world which have been ravaged just ravaged were going to end it and Ill tell you why, 4813, 4848
Over the years Ive watched, 4848, 4853
For years for 10 years for 12 years for 15 years beyond Obama and Ive watched as politicians talked about stopping countries from leaving - companies from leaving our states, 4853, 4883
You need strength is right.n" "Our states, 4883, 4890
And I watched, 4890, 4893
Remember they give the low-interest loans? Heres a low-interest loan if you stay in Pennsylvania heres a zero-interest loan you dont have to pay heres a this heres tax abatement of any kind you want well help your - it doesnt work folks thats not what they need, 4893, 4941
They have money.n" They want to go out they want to move to another country and because our politicians are so dumb they want to sell their product to us and not have any retribution not have any consequences.n "So all of thats over and I think you understand it and Hillary cant do it, 4941, 4996
Number one she cant do it because the mentality isnt there, 4996, 5007
She cant do it, 5007, 5011
No the mentality.n" "You know she said fairly recently I dont like Donald Trumps tone, 5011, 5026
His tone isnt nice, 5026, 5030
And I said here we have a country thats being taken advantage of by every country in the world, 5030, 5049
Our businesses are being taken, 5049, 5054
Our jobs being taken, 5054, 5058
Everythings being taken.n" "Here we have a world where ISIS is chopping off the heads of Christians and many others drowning people in steel cages burying people in the sand and we have somebody up there who wants to be our president that says I dont like Donald Trumps tone, 5058, 5108
" n "Folks we better get smart folks, 5108, 5116
Hey look lets see what happens, 5116, 5122
We better get smart, 5122, 5126
We better get smart, 5126, 5130
" n "We better get smart, 5130, 5136
We better get tough, 5136, 5140
And if were not smart and were not tough were not going to have a country left, 5140, 5157
And one of the things I have to talk to you about before I leave is our borders, 5157, 5175
Illegal immigrants are pouring into our country, 5175, 5182
In fact I brought something for you people, 5182, 5190
I brought—I brought—I had to do this, 5190, 5197
I didnt want to depress you, 5197, 5203
OK look, 5203, 5205
The Clinton legacy.n" "Nearly one in three manufacturing jobs in Erie PA—Erie PA sound familiar—have been lost since Clinton allowed a certain deal with China to happen, 5205, 5232
Now look at this—look at this chart, 5232, 5239
This is 2001 not long ago, 5239, 5245
This is now, 5245, 5248
Congratulations folks, 5248, 5250
I hope youre doing well, 5250, 5255
OK? I hope youre doing well, 5255, 5261
I dont want to hurt them, 5261, 5267
I hope youre doing well.n" "But you know what? You cant do well, 5267, 5280
When you have a government that is so stupid that is so—that is so incompetent you cant do it, 5280, 5299
Heres another one folks, 5299, 5303
This is what were talking about, 5303, 5309
Syrian refugees—we have no idea who they are where theyre coming from no paperwork, 5309, 5323
You saw what happened in San Bernardino, 5323, 5330
You saw what happened—frankly take a look at all over the world, 5330, 5342
Take a look at whats happening.n" "If we dont get smart and we dont get smart fast—Barack Obama is allowing Syrian refugees to come into our country by the thousands, 5342, 5372
Now I have as big a heart as anybody in this room and I want to build safe zones and I want by the way the Gulf states to pay for it because theyve got plenty of money and theyre not doing much, 5372, 5415
OK? Well supervise it, 5415, 5419
OPM other peoples money, 5419, 5423
Well supervise it right? Well supervise it.n" "But theyre going to pay for it because were protecting these people, 5423, 5442
If it werent for the United States those countries wouldnt even exist, 5442, 5454
Theyd be gone, 5454, 5457
The power we have is so enormous but we have people that dont know what theyre doing, 5457, 5474
We have an incompetent president, 5474, 5479
We have people that dont know what theyre doing.n" "So look at this, 5479, 5492
Look at this, 5492, 5495
Syrian refugees admitted to the United States on a monthly basis, 5495, 5506
Look whats happening, 5506, 5509
Look whats happening, 5509, 5512

Cant take a chance, 5523, 5527
San Bernardino they walk in, 5527, 5532
They start shooting, 5532, 5535
Paris the best the toughest gun laws in the world Paris France, 5535, 5547
They walk in, 5547, 5550
They kill 130 people, 5550, 5554
They wound so gravely hundreds of people.n" "Now let me just tell you because well—were on the Second Amendment right Second Amendment, 5554, 5576
If we had in San Bernardino—if we had in San Bernardino or in Orlando or someplace somebody in that room like this guy right here right or that guy with the blue make America great again hat on or the one with the red make America—or that woman with the beautiful blonde hair, 5576, 5629
I wish I had hair that looked like that, 5629, 5638

But lets assume they did.n" The carnage would not have been what the carnage was, 5638, 5702
We have to protect our Second Amendment, 5702, 5709
Hillary Clinton wants to kill our second amendment, 5709, 5717

And I was thinking about doing a—I bring—every once in a—like one in ten I do it you know a lot of these, 5728, 5751
I love the people, 5751, 5755
We have such a movement going on, 5755, 5762
Who likes the snake? Do you know the snake? Do you like it? Who likes the snake? Here we are with this, 5762, 5784
We know bad things are going to happen, 5784, 5792

This is what is going on in our country with our borders, 5838, 5850
And by the way were going to have a strong border were going to have a wall its going to be a powerful wall that Mexicos going to pay for the wall, 5850, 5882
" n "And we have no choice and we have no choice, 5882, 5894
But think of this, 5894, 5898
This is now a situation where this was written by Al Wilson many years ago and I read it and I said you know that really pertains to whats happening to the United States and it has to do with being fooled it has to do with a lot of different things but when youre listening to this think of our border think of the people that were letting in by the thousands and Hillary Clinton you saw those numbers right? With the chart its through the roof.n" "Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more coming into our country, 5898, 5998
How stupid are we? So are you ready you ready you like it you sure? On her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew, 5998, 6046
Oh well she cried Ill take you in and Ill take care of you.n" "Take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake, 6046, 6082

Now she hurried home from work that night, 6105, 6113

Take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake.n" "Take me in oh tender woman sighed the broken snake, 6129, 6151

Youre so beautiful she cried, 6158, 6163
But if I hadnt brought you in by now you certainly would have died, 6163, 6177
Now she stroked his pretty skin and then she kissed and held him tight, 6177, 6191
But instead of saying thank you that snake gave her a vicious bite, 6191, 6204
Take me in oh tender woman take me in for heavens sake.n" "Take me in oh tender woman sighed the vicious snake, 6204, 6226
I saved you I saved you I saved you cried that woman, 6226, 6238
And youve bit me heavens why, 6238, 6244
You know your bite is poisonous and now Im going to die, 6244, 6256
Oh shut up silly woman said the reptile with a grin, 6256, 6267
You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in, 6267, 6280

Were led by stupid people, 6287, 6292
Were led by leaders and you know honestly I didnt need this, 6292, 6304
This I didnt need, 6304, 6308
I had a nice life built a great company—a great company some of the great real estate assets of the world, 6308, 6329
I may never see them, 6329, 6334
You know if I win I may never see them again and I love them—all over the world.n" But you know what? This is so important, 6334, 6360
And I watched what was happening with the Iran deal and I watched what was happening with jobs and I watched what was happening with trade where China makes $500 billion in trade deficits with us.n "I look and I saw, 6360, 6401
Take a look at Mexico, 6401, 6406
You know the politicians say youll never ever be able to get Mexico to allow you to build a wall, 6406, 6426
I say trust me, 6426, 6430
Now they dont say that anymore, 6430, 6436
Now they say they wont put the money up to build a wall, 6436, 6449
So easy, 6449, 6451
Mexico—our trade deficit is massive massive, 6451, 6457
They make a fortune off the stupidity of the United Stated.n" Mexico will 100 percent—you hear—100 percent pay for the wall 100 percent, 6457, 6480

Were letting people in, 6497, 6501
Many of these people hate us, 6501, 6507
Many of these people dont have good thoughts, 6507, 6515
And you see what one person can do—one sick wacko can do in Orlando, 6515, 6529
And then you see his father sitting behind Hillary Clinton with a big smile on his face—with a big fat smile on his face right?n" "And he was wearing a red hat and I said I hope thats not one of my hats, 6529, 6572

At the same time—at the same time let me tell you—at the same time we need real big beautiful heart because we have to straighten out healthcare, 6698, 6725

Who did that? Who said that? Thank you.n By the way and I have to just stop for a second, 7297, 7317
Look Supreme Court Justice Scalia great, 7317, 7323
Was supposed to live for a long time, 7323, 7331
He died, 7331, 7333

This next president could have the most Supreme Court nominations of any president, 7339, 7352
Could take more justices than—it could be up to five, 7352, 7362
Probably going to be three could be four could be five, 7362, 7373
OK?n "If Hillary Clinton gets to put hard-leaning left judges on the Supreme Court number one your Second Amendment will be gone, 7373, 7395
