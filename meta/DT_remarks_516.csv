Thank you, 0, 2
 n Thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen, 2, 12
Thank you please sit down, 12, 17
Thank you.n "Its my privilege to be here in Gettysburg hallowed ground where so many lives were given in service to freedom, 17, 39
Amazing place.n" "President Lincoln served at a time of division like weve never seen before, 39, 54
It is my hope that we can look at his example to heal the divisions we are living through right now, 54, 75
We are a very divided nation.n" "Im not a politician and have never wanted to be a politician believe me, 75, 95
But when I saw the trouble our country was in I knew I couldnt stand by and watch any longer.n" Our country has been so good to me, 95, 123
I love our country and I felt I had to act, 123, 134
 n "Ive seen the system up-close-and-personal for many years, 134, 143
Ive been a major part of it.n" "I know how the game works in Washington and on Wall Street and I know how theyve rigged the rules of the game against everyday Americans, 143, 176
The rules are rigged.n" "Nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isnt even working, 176, 193
One in five households have no one with a job, 193, 203
45 million Americans are on food stamps and 47 million are living in poverty.n" We have failed our inner cities and in so doing have failed our African-American and Hispanic communities.n "Weve misguided military adventures overseas and wars that go on forever that just cannot be won by the people that are doing it now, 203, 258
They dont know how to win the wars at home.n" We have our great veterans dying while waiting for medical care.n Change has to come from outside our very broken system, 258, 289
Our system is broken.n The fact that Washington and the Washington establishment has tried so hard to stop our campaign is only more proof that our campaign represents the kind of change that only arrives once-in-a-lifetime, 289, 325
 n "The system is totally rigged and broken, 325, 333
First the issue of voter fraud, 333, 339
According to Pew there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly significantly inaccurate, 339, 360
And when I say that there are such inaccuracies its unbelievable.n" 1.8 million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting, 360, 385
I wonder how that happens.n 2.8 million people are registered in more than one state is a number folks, 385, 404
These are numbers.n Fourteen percent of non-citizens are registered to vote, 404, 415
The system is also rigged because Hillary Clinton should have been precluded from running for the presidency of the United States, 415, 436
But the FBI and the Justice Department covered up her crimes which included lying to the FBI and congress on numerous occasions and included saying I do not recall to the FBI on 39 separate times.n "She recalls everything else but 39 separate times she said I do not recall, 436, 486
Well thats a lies, 486, 490
Also then there is the deletion of at least 33000 emails after receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress thats after receiving the subpoena as an example.n" It was announced this week that the highly-respected four-star general James Cartwright maybe sentenced to up to five years in prison with a massive fine for lying on one occasion to the FBI, 490, 551
He said he did that for national security reasons.n Highly respected man, 551, 563
A four-star general, 563, 566
This took place two days ago, 566, 572
How must he feel, 572, 576
A big part of the rigging of this election is the fact that Hillary is being allowed to run despite having broken so many laws on so many different occasions.n "Why is she allowed to run? The dishonest mainstream media is also part in a major part of this corruption, 576, 626
Theyre corrupt, 626, 628
They lie and fabricate stories to make a candidate that is not their preferred choice look as bad and even dangerous as possible.n" At my rallies they never show or talk about the massive crowd size and try to diminish all of our events.n "On the other hand they dont show the small size of Hillarys crowds but in fact talk about how many people are there, 628, 695
Very small crowds, 695, 698
You know it, 698, 701
They know it.n" "Over the last two days three highly respected national polls said were in first place and one of those pollsters was the most accurate pole on the last two cycles, 701, 734
But the media refuses to even say it or put that word out, 734, 747
They refused to talk about it.n" "Theyre trying desperately to suppress my vote and the voice of the American people as an example of the power structure and fighting, 747, 776
AT&T is buying Time Warner and the CNN, 776, 784
A deal we will not approve in my administration because its too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.n" "Likewise Amazon which through its ownership controls the Washington Post should be paying massive taxes, 784, 821
Its not paying and its a very unfair playing field and you see what thats happening and what thats doing to department stores all over the country.n" "Very very unfair and youre talking about billions and billions of dollars, 821, 860
They should be paying those taxes.n" "Additionally Comcast purchase of NBC concentrates far too much power in one massive entity that is trying to tell the voters what to think and what to do, 860, 894
Deals like this destroy democracy and well look at breaking that deal up and other deals like that.n" "This should never ever have been approved in the first place, 894, 923
Theyre trying to poison the mind of the American voter, 923, 933
Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, 933, 944
Total Fabrication, 944, 946
The events never happened never, 946, 951
All of these liars will be sued after the election is over but a simple phone called placed to the biggest newspapers or television networks get them wall-to-wall coverage with virtually no fact-checking whatsoever.n" Here is why this is relevant to you, 951, 993
If they can fight somebody like me who has unlimited resources to fight back just look at what they can do to you, 993, 1016
Your jobs, 1016, 1018
Your security, 1018, 1020
Your education, 1020, 1022
Your healthcare, 1022, 1024
The violation of religious liberty, 1024, 1029
The theft of your second amendment, 1029, 1035
The loss of your factories your homes and much more.n "Look at what theyve done to you with your jobs, 1035, 1055
It is just been lined on video that the violent protests at some of my rallies like in Chicago where police and others were seriously hurt, 1055, 1081
You saw that blood pouring down their face were caused by paid paid DNC and Clinton campaign operatives.n" "Now we didnt know this, 1081, 1104
We didnt know this just came out two days ago on tape, 1104, 1116
We didnt know this, 1116, 1120
We were amazed at the level of violence, 1120, 1128
These were paid operatives, 1128, 1132
Paid by the DNC and probably the Clinton campaign.n" "This is a criminal act, 1132, 1146
Policemen were badly hurt and so were many others and these people prosecuted, 1146, 1159
But because of the rigged system they probably wont be, 1159, 1169
Just like we found out about these paid violent protesters it was probably the DNC and the Clinton campaign that put forward these liars with their fabricated stories, 1169, 1197
But well find out their involvement at a later date through litigation and I look so forward to doing.n" "The rigging of the system is designed for one reason to keep the corrupt establishment and special interests in power at your expense and everybodys expense.n" I have no special interest but you the American Vogel, 1197, 1252
 n "I didnt have to do this believe me, 1252, 1261
Theres nothing easy about it but I had to do it.n" I love our country.n I love the people of our country and I felt I had to do it, 1261, 1291
 n Thank you, 1291, 1294
One thing we all know is that we will never solve our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.n "Hillary Clinton is not running against me shes running against change and shes running against all of the American people and all of the American voters, 1294, 1347
" n We now find ourselves at that very special fork in the road do we repeat the mistakes of the past or do we choose to believe that a great future yet unwritten still lies ahead for us and for our wonderful beloved country, 1347, 1392
 n I think it does.n I know it does.n "My economic plan will deliver at least 25 million jobs in one decade, 1392, 1414
Now our jobs have been taken away, 1414, 1421
Theyve gone to Mexico, 1421, 1425
Theyve gone to so many other countries, 1425, 1432
Its a one lane highway where they get the jobs they get the factories they get the money and we get the drugs and we get the unemployment and its going to change.n" "Believe me its going to change, 1432, 1471
" n And that goes for all countries, 1471, 1479
When you look at China when you look at every trade deal we have is horrible and we should be ashamed of a people and the people that let those deals happen.n "Theyre defective and they knew they were defective and they were done for a reason, 1479, 1526
And believe me they will be unwound so fast and we will have trade, 1526, 1540
We will have great trade and itll be free trade but itll be fair trade and itll be real.n" My security plan so important.n "Theyve taken the jobs from us.n" My security plan will bring safety to our poorest communities.n My ethics plan will end corruption in our government, 1540, 1589
  We will, 1589, 1591
Corruption is massive.n We will drain the swamp in Washington DC and replace it with a new government of by and for the people, 1591, 1615
 n "That is why I have chosen Gettysburg to unveil this contract, 1615, 1627
Im asking the American people to rise above the noise and the clutter of our broken politics and to embrace that great faith and optimism that has always been the central ingredient in the American character and theres nothing better or stronger than the American character, 1627, 1673
" n I am asking the American people to dream big once again.n "What follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again, 1673, 1698
Its a contract between Donald J Trump and the American voter – and begins with bringing honesty accountability and change to Washington DC.n" Therefore on the first day of my term of office my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington DC:n FIRST a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress, 1698, 1765
 n SECOND a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition exempting military public safety and public health, 1765, 1787
 n THIRD a requirement that for every new federal regulation two existing regulations must be eliminated, 1787, 1803
Regulations are killing our country and our jobs, 1803, 1811
 n FOURTH a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service making a fortune, 1811, 1832
 n FIFTH a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government very bad, 1832, 1850
n "SIXTH a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections thats whats happening, 1850, 1866
" n "On the same day I will begin taking and really taking strongly 7 actions to protect American workers, 1866, 1886
Our American workers have been treated so badly by politicians that dont have their interest at heart and we are going to change that, 1886, 1910
Were going to change that very very fast.n" FIRST I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA one of the worst deals our country has ever made signed by Bill Clinton or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205, 1910, 1950
 n SECOND I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership a potential disaster for our country, 1950, 1967
 n "THIRD I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator, 1967, 1983
China is a currency manipulator, 1983, 1988
What they have done to us by playing currency is very sad and I dont blame them, 1988, 2005
They have been very smart, 2005, 2010
I blame our politicians for letting this take place, 2010, 2019
So easy to stop so easy to stand.n" FOURTH I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S, 2019, 2037
Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately, 2037, 2067
 n "FIFTH very importantly I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars worth of job producing American energy reserves "  including shale oil natural gas and clean coal and we will put our miners back to work.n "SIXTH I will lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks that allow for this vital energy infrastructure projects to forward, 2067, 2125
We have roadblocks like youve never ever seen, 2125, 2133
Environmental blocks structural blocks were going to allow the Keystone Pipeline and so many other things to move forward, 2133, 2152
Tremendous numbers of jobs and good for our country.n" SEVENTH we are going to cancel billions in payments to U.N, 2152, 2172
climate change programs  " and use the money to fix Americas water and environmental infrastructure, 2172, 2187
Were paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, 2187, 2196
Were going to fix our own environment, 2196, 2203
" .n Additionally on the first day I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law, 2203, 2226
We have to do that.n FIRST cancel every unconstitutional executive action memorandum and order issued by President Obama.n "SECOND begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia whose wife by the way has a Trump sign, 2226, 2264
His wife is a phenomenal woman, 2264, 2270
Has a Trump sign in her front yard isnt that nice? I just found that out this morning, 2270, 2288
From one of the 20 judges on my list you know were going to make great decisions from twenty outstanding judges on a list that we submitted who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 2288, 2326
" n THIRD we will cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities, 2326, 2338
 n "FOURTH we will begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country these are drug dealers gang heads gang members killers and cancel visas to foreign countries that wont take them back " " and when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State and they had someone who was bad really bad and they brought him back to the country and the country wouldnt take him, 2338, 2408
She said well bring him back; we dont want to force the country to take him, 2408, 2424
There wont be one such instance if I become president, 2424, 2434
" n "FIFTH Were going to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur, 2434, 2450
" " And if you look at Syria and the migration were taking in thousands and thousands of people into our country, 2450, 2472
We have no idea who they are what their thought process is where they come from and Hillary Clinton wants to increase the number of those thousands and thousands currently pouring by 550%, 2472, 2505
Radical Islamic terror is right around the corner, 2505, 2513
We have to be so tough so smart so vigilant, 2513, 2523
We cant allow that to happen "  we have enough problems, 2523, 2534
  All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting, 2534, 2547
We will be very careful.n Next I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration:n 1, 2547, 2579
Middle Class Tax Relief and Simplification Act, 2579, 2586
An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification in combination with trade reform regulatory relief and lifting the restrictions on American energy, 2586, 2625
  We need that so badly, 2625, 2630
We need jobs, 2630, 2633
Our jobs have left us, 2633, 2638
Our good jobs have really left us.n The largest tax reductions are for the middle class, 2638, 2654
 " Who have been forgotten, 2654, 2659
Called the forgotten man and woman, 2659, 2665
They have been forgotten, 2665, 2669
A middle-class family with 2 children will get basically a 35% tax cut, 2669, 2682
And thats what they can use and that money will go back into the economy, 2682, 2697
The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3 and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified, 2697, 2717
" n "The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate, 2717, 2750
Its stuck, 2750, 2752
We cant bring it back, 2752, 2757
Two and a half to five trillion dollars, 2757, 2765
Companies cant get it back into the country, 2765, 2773
Some companies are actually leaving not only because taxes are so high but because the cant get their money and they are actually leaving to get their money, 2773, 2801
We are going to simplify that, 2801, 2807
Were going to have them bring the money back into our country and use the money and spend the money on building our country, 2807, 2831
" n 2, 2831, 2834
The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S, 2834, 2862
tax-free, 2862, 2863
 n "They leave the United Stated like carrier like forward like so many others, 2863, 2877
They leave the United States and fire all of their employees, 2877, 2888
They go to Mexico or another country, 2888, 2895
They build a beautiful brand new plant, 2895, 2902
They hire other people, 2902, 2906
They then take their air conditioners their cars whatever theyre making, 2906, 2917
They send it tax free across what will be a very strong border believe me "  but they send it tax free across the border and what do we end with we have?n We have unemployment tremendous losses and we have none of the benefits, 2917, 2962
So we will establish tariffs that when they do that there will be consequences, 2962, 2976
We will work with them; we will be nice we will be fair but there has to be consequences, 2976, 2995
And when they know their consequences our companies will stop leaving the United States and going to other countries.n "3, 2995, 3015
American Energy & Infrastructure Act, 3015, 3020
Leverages public-private partnerships and private investments through tax incentives to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years, 3020, 3039
Our infrastructure is in such trouble, 3039, 3045
Weve doubled our national debt to 20 trillion dollars under president Obama, 3045, 3057
In less than 8 years 10 trillion dollars has been added, 3057, 3068
Think of it and we havent fixed anything, 3068, 3076
We havent fixed anything, 3076, 3080
What have we doe? Our roads are broken our bridges our tunnels our hospitals our schools and we have 20 trillion in debt, 3080, 3103
All-time high, 3103, 3105
Thats true our VA hospitals are in bad shape, 3105, 3114
VA is in very very bad shape and we will fix that, 3114, 3126
We are going to work on fixing that "  because our veterans are not treated properly, 3126, 3142
We have illegal immigrants that are treated far better in many instances than our veterans  " and were not going to have that, 3142, 3165
It is revenue neutral.n" 4, 3165, 3170
School Choice and Education Opportunity Act, 3170, 3176
Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public private charter magnet religious or home school of their choice, 3176, 3201
  And so importantly ends common core brings education supervision to local communities.n "We do so badly on education, 3201, 3219
If you look at the lists you see Sweden Norway Denmark different countries at the top, 3219, 3235
You see us at the bottom and yet by far per-pupil more money than anybody and its not even close, 3235, 3255
We spend more money per-pupil than anybody not even close, 3255, 3265
Were at the bottom of the list, 3265, 3272
Other countries spending far less per-pupil are at the top of the list so obviously our current system is not working, 3272, 3293
We will change it and we will make it good, 3293, 3303
" " It expands vocational and technical education which weve totally forgotten about in this country and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable.n" "Have you ever gone to school and youve been with people that arent good students but they can fix an engine or they can build a wall or they can do things that you wouldnt even think about because we can use some of the one who build the wall " " were going to need them " " were going to need them but did you ever see that how they are genius at fixing a car? They can do anything but history not so good physics not so good we have to open vocational again, 3303, 3424

Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act, 3434, 3439
 " Fully repeal Obamacare and replace it with Health Savings Accounts so we can do that, 3439, 3455
The Health Savings Account its one way there are numerous ways but this one very good way, 3455, 3472
The ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, 3472, 3481
We have to do it because thats competition, 3481, 3489
The politicians wont let go of it because the insurance companies they dont want competition but well open it up, 3489, 3509
Believe me we will get rid of it Ive been saying it for years, 3509, 3523
And lets states manage Medicaid funds it will be so good, 3523, 3534
Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4000 drugs awaiting approval and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications, 3534, 3563
Mean they are looking at drugs that are looking very good and you have terminal patients that its over these people are dying they want to get the drug, 3563, 3592
They wont be living much longer and we study it for years and years and at some point they have to do what they have to do, 3592, 3619
They have to do it properly but we have 4000 different drugs and products waiting in ling for approval and we cant get them approved, 3619, 3644
We are going to speed up that process very significantlyn" 6, 3644, 3655
Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act, 3655, 3660
Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes incentivizes employers to provide on-site childcare services and you see that with a couple of companies and it is such a great thing to see and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents with matching contributions for low-income families, 3660, 3715

With the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall, 3745, 3766
Ok, 3766, 3767
We are going to have the wall; Mexico is going to pay for the wall, 3767, 3782

after a previous deportation and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; so when somebody comes in we send them out, 3869, 3904
They come back they go to prison for quite a while, 3904, 3915
They come back they come back again they go five years, 3915, 3926
Because what is happening is they are coming back ten times and I could go cases after case they come back.Look at what happened in San Francisco five times he came back on the fifth time he killed, 3926, 3964
Five times, 3964, 3966
But so many others 110 times came back killed somebody after ten times, 3966, 3979
When they get deported they stay out otherwise they have very serious prison terms, 3979, 3993
They will stay out, 3993, 3997

But if theyre waiting in line and you see it 22 suicides a day people dont even believe it but 22 suicides a day, 4226, 4250
But if theyre waiting in line 47 days 6 days 9 days they cant get to see a doctor and a simple procedure or a simple prescription can solve their problem and they become very sick and they die they die waiting in line, 4250, 4294
Were going to give them the power to go across the street to a local doctor a private doctor a public hospital or private hospital all looking to help and all looking to do business, 4294, 4329
