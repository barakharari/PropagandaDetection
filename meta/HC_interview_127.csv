 Madam Secretary thank you so much for this time, 0, 9
 My pleasure to see you again, 9, 15
" So were very close to voting in New Hampshire."  We are, 15, 27
" The polls show Senator Sanders still significantly ahead, 27, 36
If you do not win in New Hampshire does that imply that theres going to be — or in your mind does that mean you need to change course at all? Will that mean your campaign going ahead will be different than leading into this?" " You know Rachel Ive always had a different view on this than I think maybe some others have, 36, 100
I always knew Iowa was going to be really really hard, 100, 111
And we won narrow but a win is a win."  One quarter of one percent, 111, 126
" Yes Im always happy about that, 126, 133
I always knew that Senator Sanders been in public life next door for 25 years hes on the Congress for that long he had a tremendous amount of familiarity and a sense of really belonging in the area, 133, 171
So I always knew this was going to be hard, 171, 181
I feel good about the campaign we waged here, 181, 190
I think we have an uphill battle, 190, 197
Were going to battle it until the last votes are counted and were going to turn around and head off for the next contest."  Politico.com just this afternoon just published something that says that theres changes in the works, 197, 236
Theres always these sort of campaign gossip stories, 236, 244
But they are say — they say theyre citing a half dozen people with direct knowledge of the situation, 244, 263
Their lead is "Hillary and Bill Clinton are so dissatisfied with their campaigns messaging and digital operations theyre considering staffing and strategy changes after whats expected to be a loss in Tuesdays primary." Are you planning some sort of shake up like that? " Yes somebody showed that to me, 263, 313
I have no idea what they are talking about or who they are talking to, 313, 328
Were going to take stock, 328, 333
But its going to be the campaign Ive got, 333, 342
Im confident in the people I have, 342, 349
Im very committed to them, 349, 354
Theyre committed to doing the best we can, 354, 362
Were going to take stock, 362, 367
What works what doesnt work? Were moving into a different phase of the campaign, 367, 381
Were moving into different geographic areas, 381, 387
So of course it would be malpractice not to say OK what worked? What can we do better? What can we do new and different that we have to pull out?" " President Clinton was here with you today as was your daughter, 387, 430
President Clinton did his own event yesterday which made some headlines when he had some very harsh criticism for Senator Sanders campaign essentially calling Senator Sanders and his campaign hypocritical dishonest calling out sexism from Senator Sanders supporters, 430, 468
Although Senator Sanders have called out his on supporters for sexism and said he will not tolerate it, 468, 486
Is President Clinton going further than you would in those criticisms for the Sanders campaign or do you also share the view that hes been dishonest and hypocritical?" " Well heres my view and I think Bill was really defending my supporters because we know a lot of them are being harassed online theyre being harassed at our events, 486, 545
They are being really treated badly, 545, 551
Look Im all for people who are for my opponent, 551, 561
I think its great to bring in as many new young people as possible, 561, 575
I want people treated respectfully, 575, 580
I think thats part of what he was talking about, 580, 590
I have been concerned about tone of his campaign over the last weeks, 590, 603
We were running I thought a good campaign on issues, 603, 613
Were getting to the point we have to draw contrasts, 613, 623
Thats natural, 623, 625
You know I have a health care approach, 625, 633
He has a health care approach, 633, 639
We may have the same goal but we have a different view about how we get there, 639, 656
That is fair game as it should be, 656, 664
But there has been a constant undercurrent that I said in the debate last week was a kind of attack by innuendo insinuation kind of artful smears, 664, 691
And I just said enough is enough, 691, 698
You know if you have something to say to my face say it, 698, 711
If you can point to any event any vote any view that you think has been influenced by any donation Ive ever made call it out you know? Then they put up the bankruptcy bill, 711, 746
I answered that yesterday on the morning shows, 746, 754
And so I want this innuendo to stop, 754, 762
You know lets just be honest with each other, 762, 771
Look Senator Sanders has taken money from Wall Street, 771, 780
He took it through the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, 780, 789
Thats what we do, 789, 793
That doesnt mean his views are compromised, 793, 800
It doesnt mean my views and it doesnt mean that President Obamas views when he was running for the presidency — he took a lot of money from Wall Street — in any way stopped him from pushing through and signing Dodd Frank and imposing tough rules, 800, 847
So its a — you know he gets his supporters — he sends some messages and his campaign then amplifies those messages, 847, 869
And then a lot of his young people get really worked up and theyre going off on tangents, 869, 887
They can attack me thats fine, 887, 893
Im in the arena, 893, 897
But to go after journalists who say something nice about me to go after supporters who post things to go after elected officials who are for me because you know I have the vast majority of elected officials on the Democratic side because they know us both, 897, 944
And they know I would be the president who can actually get done what Im saying." " As a journalist and who is an out and proud liberal I get attacked 50/50 by people who say Im a dyed in the wool partisan for Bernie and then the other 50 said it said Im dyed in the wool partisan for you, 944, 1005
And people really have decided one way or the other about 50/50 that Im completely in the tank, 1005, 1023
I do not notice a difference in the tone or the nastiness or the snark or the inappropriateness of those attacks that I get from the people who support you or Senator Sanders, 1023, 1056
If you did want to change the tone of things from your supporters could you? I mean he said he doesnt want sexism and other forms of offensive comments from his supporters can he do more than he is? Could you do more than you do?" " I think we should do what we can, 1056, 1111
But Im also focused on what he says, 1111, 1119
You know his argument basically is this, 1119, 1126
Anyone who has taken a donation from anyone connected with Wall Street is compromised, 1126, 1140
Theyre vote has been bought, 1140, 1145
They cant be trusted, 1145, 1149
That is just not true, 1149, 1154
If it is true now it includes him we know because hes taken contributions from Wall Street." " He said yesterday that no politician theres never been a politician in history who says yes the money that I took influences me, 1154, 1195
So therefore essentially implying like the defense that there isnt that you dont claim to be been influenced is by the donations is no defense." " But lets put out the proof Rachel, 1195, 1228
Dont listen to what people say, 1228, 1234
I find it deeply offensive, 1234, 1239
You know I have worked really hard, 1239, 1246
Ive taken on many more powerful groups than he has, 1246, 1256
Ive taken on the drug companies the insurance companies, 1256, 1265
Ive got big oil going after me, 1265, 1272
Ive got hedge fund guys spending $6 millions of dollars in ads against me which I would think would raise an interesting question if they are so worried about Bernie why are they trying to defeat me? Ive taken onto gun lobby something that you know he never has done, 1272, 1322
So Ive got the scars to prove my bona fides and what Im willing to take on and how Ive stood firm against an onslaught of attacks you know turning me into the political pinata sometimes, 1322, 1358
So point to the evidence, 1358, 1363
Otherwise stop it, 1363, 1366
Lets talk about I want to get to universal coverage building on the Affordable Care Act, 1366, 1382
You want to start over with single payer, 1382, 1390
Let the people decide whats the best way to do this, 1390, 1401
So thats what this should be about." " On the — staying for a moment on that that line of attack, 1401, 1422
You had mentioned in the debate when Chuck asked you about transcripts of speeches that you gave paid speeches that you would look into it, 1422, 1447
Weve had some further word from your campaign that there may be a release of those transcripts, 1447, 1464
Whats the status of that? Do you expect to release those speeches?" " Well you know what I said the other day — you know look Im getting a little bit weary of the double standard, 1464, 1500
Theres a lot of people on both sides, 1500, 1508
If were going to start saying what you did when youre out of public office when youre in the private sector what you did fair game, 1508, 1534
Release it all, 1534, 1537
Im all for that."  You mean all presidential candidates? " Yes everybody release everything, 1537, 1551
But again Ive been asking to do something for which theres no basis just the attempt to cast suspicion, 1551, 1570
So I said I will look into it, 1570, 1578
We will look into it, 1578, 1583
But you know whats good for the gander should be good for the goose, 1583, 1597
"  " So you wouldnt do it unilaterally but if everybodys going to do it you would do it?" " Well this is — Im really not thinking about it until I get through New Hampshire to be honest, 1597, 1636
I want to get through tomorrow and then you know its going to be very boring for people once it is done under whatever circumstances."  Did you see the Republican debate on Saturday night?  I was at my own event in Portsmouth, 1636, 1678
So I — I did not see, 1678, 1685
 Have you been able to resist the temptation to watch the clips of Marco Rubio saying the same thing over and over and over again?  I did get to see that because I was on every news channel that I was flipping around, 1685, 1728
" Do you have — I mean hes seen as at least coming out of Iowa as having a lot of momentum as a potential nominee for the Republican Party, 1728, 1758
Do you have any reaction or opinion about that performance from him?" " Im going to leave my opinions to myself because I dont want to in any way influence their process because they have to make their decision and clearly the longer it lasts and the more difficult it is the better it will be for us." " I went to some Republican candidate events since Ive been up here and —"  They let you in? " They let me in, 1758, 1840
I wear a baseball hat, 1840, 1845
Incognito situation, 1845, 1847
But I specifically wanted to talk to women voters who were there at Republican candidate events, 1847, 1863
And I found a number of different women to talk to, 1863, 1874
Some are dyed this wool Republicans but more often I found are women open to the idea of voting for a Democrat, 1874, 1896
I talked to a few women who voted for Barack Obama either last time or in 2008, 1896, 1913
But they are shopping for a Republican candidate this year, 1913, 1923
And 2-1 the reason they said they are shopping for a Republican candidate and not thinking about voting here in the Democratic side is because they do not believe that you are honest, 1923, 1956
They have issue with your trustworthiness, 1956, 1962
I know you see this come up in the polls and people talk about their feelings about the various candidates, 1962, 1982
Im sure you disagree with that assessment from them, 1982, 1991
I understand that, 1991, 1994
But how do you make the case to people to women in particular for whom thats the objection, 1994, 2012
Thats why they cant pull the lever for you." " You know obviously this is not anything I want to hear because I find it so absolutely contrary to who I am and who all these people who support me who know me work with me and count on me know who I am, 2012, 2066
But I thought a lot about it Rachel because when you think back I emerged on the national scene in 1992, 2066, 2087
I have been under relentless attack ever since, 2087, 2095
Now just read behavioral science read psychology even when the attacks proved to be unfounded untrue it leaves a residue right? People say well why is she being attacked so much? It must be something there, 2095, 2131
So I get through the 90s, 2131, 2137
I run for the Senate, 2137, 2142
Same thing happen, 2142, 2145
I worked I gained the trust of the people of New York, 2145, 2157
When I run again I get a larger percentage of the vote, 2157, 2169
So people who see me in action people who count on me people who know that if I tell you something intend to do I will do everything in my power to make that happen, 2169, 2204
Then President-elect Obama turns around after that hard fought campaign with all sorts of accusations flying around say I trust you I want you to be my secretary of state, 2204, 2234
When Im holding office I get along well with Republicans, 2234, 2244
I will always have the you know right wingers who are never going to give up on trying to push me down and push me out, 2244, 2270
They view me as a threat, 2270, 2276
And I accept that, 2276, 2280
But when I get to work with people we get things done, 2280, 2292
And thats been my pattern, 2292, 2297
So when I get that question and I ask people I say what is it you are really reacting to? Very often they dont know, 2297, 2322
Then a lot of them will say well Benghazi, 2322, 2331
I said OK Benghazi, 2331, 2335
You know did you know there were nine separate investigations eight of them independent one of them clearly partisan admittedly to try to bring me down politically, 2335, 2362
And they all reach the same conclusions, 2362, 2369
There were things we could have and should have done better, 2369, 2380
I immediately said we would, 2380, 2385
I testified for 11 hours, 2385, 2390
I answered every question but its still on the TV, 2390, 2400
I hear people talking about it, 2400, 2406
I cant stop them from talking about it, 2406, 2414
I can only tell you what the facts are, 2414, 2423
I can tell you that in the last what 36 37 years weve had terrorist problems in Iran in Lebanon in Kenya in Tanzania in New York and yes in Benghazi — none of them were every politicized, 2423, 2461
We lost 258 marines and embassy personnel in Beirut, 2461, 2470
The Democrats didnt stand up and go after the secretary of state, 2470, 2482
We lost people in Kenya and Tanzania 12 Americans hundreds of Africans, 2482, 2494
Madeleine Albright was secretary of state she forthrightly asked for a report, 2494, 2506
She made it public, 2506, 2510
People didnt turn it into a partisan attack, 2510, 2518
So I have to only conclude that there is a concerted effort to try to make partisan advantage by really throwing some much at me that even if little splotches of it stick it will cloud peoples judgment of me, 2518, 2558
So thats a burden I carry, 2558, 2564
But when you stop and think you know the people who have supported me are not doing it because they just like me, 2564, 2587
I have the governor of Vermont supporting me, 2587, 2595
I have Pat Leahy the senator from Vermont supporting me the two former governors Madeleine Kunin and Howard Dean supporting me, 2595, 2616
They clearly know us both, 2616, 2621
They clearly prefer to support me, 2621, 2627
I have the senator here the governor in New Hampshire, 2627, 2637
They know me, 2637, 2640
They trust me, 2640, 2643
Theyre not the kind of people who would just sign onto campaign for some frivolous reason, 2643, 2659
I have all my friends from the Senate Cory Booker and Tim Kaine and Kirsten Gillibrand and Debbie Stabenow and Amy Klobuchar they were all up here in the snow because they believe in me and they trust me, 2659, 2698
So I cant stop the barrage of attacks, 2698, 2706
I want your viewers and anyone else who would be interested in this to ask themselves why does the right and particularly the Republicans spend so much time money and effort through the media through their advertising because you look at the Republicans are running more ads against me than they run against each other accusing me of being this and that all kinds of accusations, 2706, 2772
Why? Ill tell you why because they are afraid of me, 2772, 2783
They know that I will be a president who yes I will listen to people I will seek common ground but I will stand my ground and I know how to get things done, 2783, 2817
And thats the last thing these guys want to see again." " What did you learn by going there that you didnt need before?" " Nothing substitutes for sitting like I did and you were there when you were there with mothers who told me about what had happened to their families, 2817, 2869
A mother who moved to Flint just serendipitously right up at the time the crisis was beginning a year ago April pregnant with twins started seeing rashes lost her twins, 2869, 2899
Just sitting there like Im sitting with you just hearing that story you know there is a depth of emotion and horror frankly associated with not being able to trust the water you drink and that you bathe your baby in, 2899, 2940
And listening to a lot of officials explained in detail how little control they had because their city was under emergency management under the governor getting into the real detail about what they could and couldnt do and how they literally couldnt get phone calls returned letters answered talking to some of the water warriors who have been on this issue and doing everything they could to bring it to public attention talking to the doctors who are leading up the efforts to test kid and what more they need, 2940, 3030
It really filled out in great excruciating detail how terribly damaged and abused this community has been and it reminded me that people have a right to be angry, 3030, 3059
I have no argument with the anger the insecurity the fear the worry that people have when your government fails you when the economy fails you when politics fails you anger is a natural and frankly expected result, 3059, 3097
But as we were talking yesterday and as this incredible mayor who has just taken this city on her back and is trying to lift it up said OK we are so distraught our hearts are broken, 3097, 3134
Our stomachs are sick with worry about what happens next but we need a plan, 3134, 3149
So I came to try to get them more support working with all levels of government to try to make sure they had whatever they needed to do as much as possible to empower themselves and I got a long list of you know follow up I will be doing over the next weeks."  You said yesterday you were making a personal commitment you would see it through —  Yes, 3149, 3219
" — to the end, 3219, 3224
I will say just my opinion being there my felling when I was there was that I couldnt believe the basic things that families needed to cope on a day-to-day basis were not attended to, 3224, 3259
What I aim at specifically there is no day-to-day delivery of clean water in Flint, 3259, 3274
So theres a lot love people average poor American city people dont have transportation or people could be house bound elderly people right now still to this day today the day before the New Hampshire primary the plan is for people to go out to the fire stations and collect their allotted one case of bottled water per day — is there a sense in which the emergency not just fixing it for the long haul but the emergency of what people need day-to-day still isnt being attended to and there ought to be some quicker response right now?" " Yes, 3274, 3375
Yes, 3375, 3376
Look as I said yesterday weve got a very big infrastructure problem that has to be fixed, 3376, 3393
Congress is working on that my friend Debbie Stabenow is really leading the charge, 3393, 3407
We have a huge set of problems having to do with the needs that people have that are not being met, 3407, 3428
You mentioned one of them clean water, 3428, 3435
We still dont have all the testing set up to be done."  Right, 3435, 3448
" We dont have the planning yet for what has to happen in the schools, 3448, 3463
We dont know whether we can get not just clean water but the kind of nutrition that can maybe begin to mitigate to some extent the affects of blood before it gets from the bloodstream into tissues muscles et cetera, 3463, 3503
So we have a long list and I brought some folks with me who are going to stay involved and help with that planning process and we have a big lack of trust and one of the things that I have advocated is we need to find a way not just to empower but to hire people in the community to be the outreach workers to do the water delivery to be on the front lines in their neighborhoods, 3503, 3582
So were putting together under the mayors leadership a kind of matrix of tasks and who can do them what they need to be able to do them, 3582, 3610
A lot of them dont need training, 3610, 3617
Some of them might, 3617, 3621
And so how do we piece all this together and talking with the city council county commissioners and others theres roles for everybody to play but somebody has to have the overall approach that is followed."  And quick, 3621, 3659
 Yes and very quick, 3659, 3663
