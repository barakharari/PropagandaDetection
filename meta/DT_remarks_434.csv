Today I am here to talk about three crucial words that should be at the center of our foreign policy: Peace Through Strength, 0, 23
We want to achieve a stable peaceful world with less conflict and more common ground, 23, 38
"I am proposing a new foreign policy focused on advancing Americas core national interests promoting regional stability and producing an easing of tensions in the world, 38, 64
This will require rethinking the failed policies of the past." We can make new friends rebuild old alliances and bring new allies into the fold, 64, 89
"Im proud to have the support of warfighting generals active duty military and the top experts who know both how to win – and how to avoid the endless wars we are caught in now, 89, 124
Just yesterday 88 top Generals and Admirals endorsed my campaign." In a Trump Administration our actions in the Middle East will be tempered by realism, 124, 149
The current strategy of toppling regimes with no plan for what to do the day after only produces power vacuums that are filled by terrorists, 149, 174
Gradual reform not sudden and radical change should be our guiding objective in that region, 174, 189
We should work with any country that shares our goal of destroying ISIS and defeating Radical Islamic terrorism and form new friendships and partnerships based on this mission, 189, 217
We now have an Administration and a former Secretary of State who refuse to say Radical Islamic Terrorism, 217, 235
Immediately after taking office I will ask my generals to present to me a plan within 30 days to defeat and destroy ISIS, 235, 258
This will require military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare – as I laid out in my speech on defeating Radical Islamic terrorism several weeks ago, 258, 288
Instead of an apology tour I will proudly promote our system of government and our way of life as the best in the world – just like we did in our campaign against communism during the Cold War, 288, 326
We will show the whole world how proud we are to be American, 326, 339
At the same time immigration security is a vital part of our national security, 339, 353
We only want to admit people to our country who will support our values and love our people, 353, 371
These are the pillars of a sound national security strategy, 371, 381
"Unlike my opponent my foreign policy will emphasize diplomacy not destruction, 381, 392
Hillary Clintons legacy in Iraq Libya and Syria has produced only turmoil and suffering, 392, 406
Her destructive policies have displaced millions of people then she has invited the refugees into the West with no plan to screen them." "Including Veteran healthcare costs the price of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could total $6 trillion according to a report in the Washington Examiner, 406, 454
Yet after all this money spent and lives lost Clintons policies as Secretary of State have left the Middle East in more disarray than ever before." Meanwhile China has grown more aggressive and North Korea more dangerous and belligerent, 454, 493
Russia has defied this Administration at every turn, 493, 501
Putin has no respect for President Obama or Hillary Clinton, 501, 511
"Sometimes it has seemed like there wasnt a country in the Middle East that Hillary Clinton didnt want to invade intervene or topple, 511, 534
She is trigger-happy and unstable when it comes to war." "Hillary Clinton is just reckless – so reckless in fact she put her emails on an illegal server that our enemies could easily hack, 534, 568
Then Clintons team used a technology called bleachbit to acid wash her emails, 568, 581
They even took a hammer to some of her 13 phones to cover her tracks and obstruct justice, 581, 599
These email records were destroyed after she received a subpoena to turn them over." "In the FBI report she claimed she couldnt recall important information on 39 occasions." She cant even remember whether she was trained in classified information and said she didnt even know the letter "C" means confidential, 599, 649
"If she cant remember such crucial events and information she is unfit to be Commander-in-Chief." Her conduct is simply disqualifying, 649, 669
She talks about her experience but Hillary Clintons only foreign policy experience is "failure." Everywhere she got involved things got worse, 669, 690
"Lets look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before Hillary Clinton was sworn-in." Libya was stable, 690, 711
Syria was under control, 711, 715
Egypt was ruled by a secular President and an ally of the United States, 715, 729
Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence, 729, 736
The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished, 736, 751
Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions, 751, 759
Fast-forward to today, 759, 762
What have the decisions of Obama-Clinton produced? Libya is in ruins our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead and ISIS has gained a new base of operations, 762, 791
Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war, 791, 801
ISIS controls large portions of territory, 801, 807
A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States, 807, 817
And hundreds of thousands are dead, 817, 823
In Egypt terrorists have gained a foothold in the Sinai desert near the Suez Canal one of the most essential waterways in the world, 823, 847
Iraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose, 847, 857
ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the West, 857, 868
"Iran the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism is now flush with $150 billion dollars in cash released by the United States – plus another $1.7 billion dollars in cash ransom payments, 868, 900
In other words our country was blackmailed and extorted into paying this unheard-of amount of money." Worst of all the Nuclear deal puts Iran the number one state sponsor of Radical Islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons, 900, 939
"This is Hillary Clintons foreign policy legacy." "But thats not all, 939, 950
President Obama and Hillary Clinton have also overseen deep cuts in our military which only invite more aggression from our adversaries." History shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is greatest, 950, 985
We want to deter avoid and prevent conflict through our unquestioned military strength, 985, 998
Under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton defense spending is on track to fall to its lowest level as a share of the economy since the end of World War II, 998, 1028
We currently have the smallest Army since 1940, 1028, 1036
The Navy is among the smallest it has been since 1915, 1036, 1047
And the Air Force is the smallest it has been since 1947, 1047, 1059
When Ronald Reagan left office our Navy had 592 ships, 1059, 1069
When Barack Obama took office it had 285 ships, 1069, 1078
Today the Navy has just 276 ships, 1078, 1085
The average Air Force aircraft is 27 years-old, 1085, 1093
We have 2nd generation B-52 bombers – their fathers flew the same plane, 1093, 1106
Our Army has been shrinking rapidly from 553000 soldiers in 2009 to just 479000 today, 1106, 1121
"In 2009 our Marine Corps had 202000 active Marines, 1121, 1130
Today its just 182000." Our ship count is below the minimum of 308 that the Navy says is needed to execute its current missions, 1130, 1154
President Obama plans to reduce the Army to 450000 troops—which would hamstring our ability to defend the United States, 1154, 1173
It takes 22 years on average to field a major new weapons system, 1173, 1186
In 2010 the US spent $554 billion on non-war base defense spending, 1186, 1198
In the current year we are spending $548 billion – a cut of 10% in real inflation-adjusted dollars, 1198, 1216
This reduction was done through what is known as the sequester or automatic defense budget cuts, 1216, 1232
Under the budget agreement defense took half of the cuts – even though it makes up only one-sixth of the budget, 1232, 1253
As soon as I take office I will ask Congress to fully eliminate the defense sequester and will submit a new budget to rebuild our military, 1253, 1279
This will increase certainty in the defense community as to funding and will allow military leaders to plan for our future defense needs, 1279, 1302
As part of removing the defense sequester I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending, 1302, 1322
In the process we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public, 1322, 1336
I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks – and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans, 1336, 1362
Government-wide improper government payments are estimated to exceed $135 billion per year and the amount of unpaid taxes is estimated to be as high as $385 billion, 1362, 1389
We can also reduce the size of the federal bureaucracy through responsible workforce attrition – that is when employees retire they can be replaced by a smaller number of new employees, 1389, 1420
We can also stop funding programs that are not authorized in law, 1420, 1432
Congress spent $320 billion last year on 256 expired laws, 1432, 1442
Removing just 5 percent of that will reduce spending by almost $200 billion over 10 years, 1442, 1458
The military will not be exempt either – the military bureaucracy will have to be trimmed as well, 1458, 1476
Early in my term I will also be requesting that all NATO nations promptly pay their bills which many are not doing right now, 1476, 1500
Only 5 NATO countries including the United States are currently meeting the minimum requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense, 1500, 1521
Additionally I will be respectfully asking countries such as Germany Japan South Korea and Saudi Arabia to pay more for the tremendous security we provide them, 1521, 1547
Finally we will have at our disposal additional revenues from unleashing American energy, 1547, 1560
The Institute for Energy Research cites a "short-run" figure of as much as $36 billion annually from increased energy production, 1560, 1580
Using these new funds I will ask my Secretary of Defense to propose a new defense budget to meet the following long-term goals: "We will build an active Army of around 540000 as the Armys chief of staff has said he needs, 1580, 1622
We now have only 31 Brigade Combat Teams or 490000 troops and only one-third of combat teams are considered combat-ready." We will build a Marine Corps based on 36 battalions which the Heritage Foundation notes is the minimum needed to deal with major contingencies – we have 23 now, 1622, 1671
We will build a Navy of 350 surface ships and submarines as recommended by the bipartisan National Defense Panel – we have 276 ships now, 1671, 1696
And we will build an Air Force of at least 1200 fighter aircraft which the Heritage Foundation has shown to be needed to execute current missions – we have 1113 now, 1696, 1727
We will also seek to develop a state of the art missile defense system, 1727, 1741
Under Obama-Clinton our ballistic missile defense capability has been degraded at the very moment the US and its allies are facing a heightened missile threat from states like Iran and North Korea, 1741, 1773
As these potential adversaries grow their missile programs US military facilities in Asia and the Middle East as well as our allies are increasingly in range with the United States homeland also potentially threatened, 1773, 1807
We propose to rebuild the key tools of missile defense starting with the Navy cruisers that are the foundation of our missile defense capabilities in Europe Asia and the Middle East, 1807, 1838
The Obama-Clinton administration tried repeatedly to remove our cruisers from service then refused to modernize these aging ships, 1838, 1856
We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs; this will cost around $220 million per modernization as we seek to modernize a significant portion of these 22 ships, 1856, 1893
As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years, 1893, 1924
Accomplishing this military rebuild will be a fifty-state effort —every state in the union will be able to take part in rebuilding our military and developing the technologies of tomorrow, 1924, 1954
"In addition we will improve the Department of Defenses cyber capabilities, 1954, 1965
Hillary Clinton has taught us all how vulnerable we are to cyber hacking." Which is why one of the first things we must do is to enforce all classification rules and enforce all laws relating to the handling of classified information, 1965, 2006
Hillary Clinton put her emails on a secret server to cover-up her pay-for-play scandals at the State Department, 2006, 2024
Nothing threatens the integrity of our Democracy more than when government officials put their public office up for sale, 2024, 2043
We will also make it a priority to develop defensive and offensive cyber capabilities at our U.S, 2043, 2060
Cyber Command and recruit the best and brightest Americans, 2060, 2069
One of my first directives after taking office will be asking the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all relevant federal departments to conduct a thorough review of United States cyber defenses and identify all vulnerabilities – in our power grid our communications systems and all vital infrastructure, 2069, 2116
I will then ask for a plan to immediately protect those vulnerabilities, 2116, 2128
At the same time we will invest heavily in offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt our enemies including terrorists who rely heavily on internet communications, 2128, 2152
These new investments in cybersecurity and the modernization of our military will spur substantial new job creation in the private sector and help create the jobs and technologies of tomorrow, 2152, 2182
"America must be the worlds dominant technological powerhouse of the 21st century and young Americans – including in our inner cities – should get these new jobs." We must also ensure that we have the best medical care education and support for our military service members and their families – both when they serve and when they return to civilian life, 2182, 2243
Our debt to our men and women in uniform is eternal, 2243, 2254
To all those who have served this nation I say: I will never let you down, 2254, 2270
We will protect those who protect us, 2270, 2277
And we will follow their example of unity, 2277, 2285
We will work across all racial and income lines to create One American Nation, 2285, 2299
Together we will have one great American future, 2299, 2307
We will be one people under one God saluting one American flag, 2307, 2319
America will be a prosperous generous and inclusive society, 2319, 2328
We will discard the failed policies and division of the past and embrace true American change to rebuild our economy rebuild our inner cities and rebuild our country, 2328, 2356
We will bring back our jobs, 2356, 2362
We will make America strong again, 2362, 2368
We will make America safe again, 2368, 2374
And we will make America great again, 2374, 2381
