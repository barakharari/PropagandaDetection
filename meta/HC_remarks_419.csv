"Hello Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you, 0, 15
"And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular I want to thank all of the elected officials, 15, 35
Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida, 35, 49
Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, 49, 55
Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach, 55, 64
Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami, 64, 72
Thanks to all the others who were part of the program, 72, 83
As we were coming in we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd and I was told as I was coming out theres an overflow but they can hear us in the overflow and were so happy youre here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd, 83, 131
But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the worlds most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore." "About a decade ago Al made a movie called An Inconvenient Truth, 131, 167
Now maybe some of you have seen it but if you havent I hope youll watch it tonight, 167, 185
It doesnt have a lot of special effects – but it does have a lot of drama." "And heres the main message: climate change is real its urgent and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it, 185, 225
Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions, 225, 236
We can transform our economy, 236, 241
We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution, 241, 250
And above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren." "Now let me just say – so so lets remember lets remember whats at stake, 250, 284
Im running against a guy who denies science denies climate change claims its a hoax created by the Chinese, 284, 303
So this is something that Al Gores been working on for a really long time, 303, 318
And I want you to know how far back he goes, 318, 329
It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen, 329, 355
And then when Al became a senator he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions and as vice president he led Americas efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions, 355, 390
You take all this together those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007." I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent and in the face of a lot of people – in public life in business in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science – he never wavered, 390, 454
And in the years since the climate challenge has only grown more stark, 454, 467
And I will tell you this it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election, 467, 486
Look at it this way, 486, 491
Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change to protect our planet to protect our health and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy, 491, 527
Or in the alternative we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk, 527, 545
"So weve really got to get this right, 545, 553
And if you need additional convincing just remember what happened this week, 553, 565
Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti, 565, 588
North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week if not longer, 588, 610
We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster." "Thats why Ive encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew or to UNICEF helping children and families on the ground in Haiti." "Now some will say Weve always had hurricanes, 610, 683
Theyve always been destructive, 683, 687
And thats true, 687, 690
But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change, 690, 701
Right now the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures – and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas, 701, 729
Sea levels have already risen about a foot – one foot – in much of the Southeast which means that Matthews storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe." "Plus as you know the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes, 729, 775
Its become a daily reality here in Miami, 775, 783
You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide, 783, 798
The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system, 798, 807
Sometimes people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them." "So if you need proof that climate change is real and that its costly there you go, 807, 846
So at this rate at this rate my friends my friends please, 846, 858
Lets focus on whats really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country because this is what I want you to hear and understand, 858, 888
At the rate we are going one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century and when kids – like that adorable young boy over there on his dads shoulders – are grandparents we believe thats more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk and nationwide its as much as $882 billion in property at risk." "But theres also health consequences, 888, 958
Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges, 958, 976
And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse which is especially bad for our children, 976, 996
And look at what is happening in California a brutal five-year drought, 996, 1008
Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year." "And its also about national security, 1008, 1027
The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our Americas national security, 1027, 1041
The U.S, 1041, 1043
Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk Virginia, 1043, 1050
Its the largest naval installation in the world, 1050, 1058
And because of rising sea level the base is frequently flooded even when its sunny, 1058, 1073
So thats why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations not just in Norfolk but at all of our military bases around the world." "So you would think if you look at the facts if you listen to the science that even the most committed climate skeptic would say Ok I agree somethings happening here, 1073, 1134
We need to take it seriously." "But unfortunately there are still plenty of people – in Washington on the campaign trail – who wont face whats happening right in front of us." "Donald Trump is quote not a big believer in climate change, 1134, 1177
As I said he said its a hoax created by the Chinese, 1177, 1189
And in our first debate two weeks ago he tried to deny saying that, 1189, 1203
But that tweet is still there for everyone to see." "And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida like Miami Beachs Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these Sunny Day Floods, 1203, 1246
Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemán, 1246, 1258
Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alemán, 1258, 1270
John Elizabeth is a Republican but shes supporting our campaign—because she knows America cant afford a candidate who doesnt accept climate science, 1270, 1292
Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security or what about the ranchers in Colorado or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say Our lives and jobs and families are being affected – please lets come together as a country and do something about it." We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House, 1292, 1362
At all that is absolutely unacceptable, 1362, 1368
We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat creating good jobs and yes saving our planet, 1368, 1396
"So heres what I want to do." First we need to do a lot more on clean energy, 1396, 1414
The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany China or us—and I want it to be us, 1414, 1438
And I want you to be part of making it us, 1438, 1449
And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines, 1449, 1475
Modernizing our electric grid, 1475, 1479
Retrofitting buildings, 1479, 1481
Building resilient 21st century infrastructure and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind—not our cities or our small towns or our remote rural areas, 1481, 1511
"Now you wouldnt know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is, 1511, 1529
He has such a dark divisive view of America but that doesnt tell the story about whats really going on, 1529, 1549
Its actually pretty exciting, 1549, 1553
In red states and blue states local leaders are stepping up, 1553, 1564
Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America – union workers in Michigan union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy, 1564, 1602
Iowa Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind, 1602, 1614
Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie, 1614, 1626
Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America, 1626, 1638
I think that is so exciting – there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency." And in Spartanburg South Carolina a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm, 1638, 1677
That landfill was a blight and a health threat just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood, 1677, 1694
Now that same land will generate enough clean renewable electricity to power 500 homes, 1694, 1708
"So this is what we can do, 1708, 1715
And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that, 1715, 1728
As president I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term, 1728, 1749
And lets generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade, 1749, 1764
Lets make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third." And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing putting big partnerships together between states cities and rural communities, 1764, 1818
"We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do, 1818, 1833
So Im hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future, 1833, 1859
The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America, 1859, 1870
We want them manufactured in America installed in America and putting people to work in America." "And while we do that lets make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us, 1870, 1910
We need to invest in resilient infrastructure, 1910, 1917
Now sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times lets be more creative – like in New York Harbor where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge, 1917, 1950
Sometimes well overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours, 1950, 1964
In Philadelphia theyre trying something else: green roofs porous pavements curbside gardens to help absorb storm water." "And heres something we dont talk enough about, 1964, 1989
Lets make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster, 1989, 2004
Because sadly I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital because the electricity went off, 2004, 2041
Nurses I love nurses – heroic courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing, 2041, 2063
Now here in Miami you know how important this is, 2063, 2073
You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Childrens Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason, 2073, 2088
And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience." "And then finally we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge, 2088, 2118
If we dont do it nobody will do it, 2118, 2127
We must confront the climate challenge, 2127, 2133
Theres no doubt about that, 2133, 2138
And so lets move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves." "When I was Secretary of State I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority, 2138, 2176
We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution, 2176, 2201
In fact we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen Denmark – slip past the guards – it was all very cloak and dagger, 2201, 2226
But for a really important purpose and because of that breakthrough and a lot of patient persistent work and because of American leadership 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December, 2226, 2259
Its called the Paris Agreement, 2259, 2264
And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last best chance to solve the global climate crisis." "And what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement, 2264, 2299
He doesnt care what it would do to the planet, 2299, 2309
He doesnt care how much that would damage American leadership in the world, 2309, 2322
He doesnt care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids." "Well he may not care – but we do, 2322, 2348
And thats why this election is so critically important because on the ballot it is not just my name, 2348, 2367
Its every issue we care about its our values as a country." Climate change needs to be a voting issue, 2367, 2387
We need to elect people up and down the ballot at every level of government who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done, 2387, 2418
Please we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses—and certainly not to the White House, 2418, 2439
"And if you care about climate your Senate race is also really important and Ill tell you why, 2439, 2457
It is unacceptable it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio when asked about climate change to say Im not a scientist, 2457, 2479
Well why doesnt he ask a scientist and then maybe then hed understand why it is so important that he representing Florida be committed to climate change? Thats why I hope that youll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate." "Look we need leaders who can get results, 2479, 2528
Its easy to stonewall, 2528, 2532
Its not enough to protest: we need creativity we need hard work, 2532, 2544
And when it comes to climate change we dont have a minute to waste." "So I know its easy to get cynical—especially about our politics, 2544, 2569
I get that, 2569, 2572
But this election matters more than any has in a really long time and I believe that as strongly as I can weve got to address this issue for our sakes our children our grandchildren, 2572, 2607
And its so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference." And just look if you will – look at the difference between your state the Sunshine State which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now, 2607, 2650
And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words climate change, 2650, 2673
So my friends this is a big deal in the election and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world, 2673, 2699
And there isnt anybody – there isnt anybody who knows more has done more has worked harder, 2699, 2716
I know he was in Miami just last year training and educating people to be climate change activists, 2716, 2734
I cant wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States, 2734, 2751
So please join me in welcoming our former vice president a climate change leader and an all-around great guy Al Gore." , 2751, 2772
