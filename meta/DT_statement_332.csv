The FBI Director laid out today a detailed case of how Hillary Clinton compromised the safety of the American people by storing highly classified information on a private email server with no security, 0, 33
He confirmed that her email could easily have been hacked by hostile actors and confirmed that those she emailed with were hacked, 33, 55
Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton and this fact alone disqualifies her from service, 55, 74
It has also been revealed that Hillary Clinton lied when she said that she did not send classified information, 74, 93
The FBI Director confirmed that over 100 emails were deemed classified at the time they were sent including emails classified as top secret, 93, 116
"On top of it all Hillary Clintons lawyers wiped the servers clean to delete another 30000 emails – hiding her corrupt dealings from investigators, 116, 140
She used the State Department for her personal gain trading favors for cash and tried to conceal the records, 140, 159
Also she didnt want people to know the details about her botched decisions in Libya Syria Iraq and Egypt that destabilized the Middle East." But because of our rigged system that holds the American people to one standard and people like Hillary Clinton to another it does not look like she will be facing the criminal charges that she deserves, 159, 219
"Bill Clinton didnt accidentally run into the Attorney General on the airport tarmac last week in Phoenix, 219, 236
Hillary Clinton didnt accidentally sneak into the FBI during one of the countrys biggest holiday weekends to testify on her illegal activities something that wouldnt be afforded to others under investigation (and on a Saturday of all days), 236, 274
It was no accident that charges were not recommended against Hillary the exact same day as President Obama campaigns with her for the first time." Folks – the system is rigged, 274, 305
The normal punishment in this case would include losing authority to handle classified information and that too disqualifies Hillary Clinton from being President, 305, 328
The final jury will be the American people and they will issue the verdict on her corruption incompetence and bad judgment on November 8th, 328, 352
