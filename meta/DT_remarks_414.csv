They are going through a lot.n" We must defeat radical Islamic terrorism!  n Anyone who will not name our enemy is not fit to lead our country, 225, 252
 n Eight years of Obama/Clinton policies have sacrificed our safety and undermined our freedom and independence, 252, 268
Our jobs have moved to other countries, 268, 275
Islamic terrorism has spread within our shores, 275, 282
And an open border has crushed low-income workers and threatened and I mean totally threatened our security, 282, 299
 n The issues we face here in America are similar to the issues faced in Britain during their referendum on membership in the European Union, 299, 324
This is the movement known as Brexit.n "On June 23rd the people of Britain voted to declare their independence which is what were looking to do also folks " n "From their international government which hasnt worked, 324, 361
They voted to break away from rule by large corporations and media executives who believe in a world without borders, 361, 381
" n They voted to reclaim control over immigration over their economy over their government, 381, 396
 n Working people and the great people of the U.K, 396, 406
took control of their destiny, 406, 411
 n "The people profiting from the rigged system and it is rigged were finding it out every single day the multinational banks the media celebrities the big donors tried to scare the British people out of voting for change, 411, 450
The same thing is happening right here in the United States, 450, 461
Its happening.n" "All the people benefiting from our rigged system dont want things to change, 461, 476
They want you to believe things cant be changed.n" And they can so easily so easily and so smartly.n And we all know things have to change, 476, 503
We have no choice, 503, 507
And they have to change right now, 507, 514
 n "Before the vote I said that Britain would leave the EU sometimes referred to as European Union and I said it and I took a lot of heat when I said it, 514, 547
People said what does he know what does he know? And guess what? I was very supportive of their right to do it and to take control of their own future like exactly what were going to be voting for on November 8th, 547, 590
" n "Hillary Clinton who has been on the wrong side of history in every major decision shes only made bad decisions shes got bad judgment she doesnt know what shes doing folks, 590, 623

She gets them all wrong doesnt she? She really got the e-mails wrong that I can tell you, 649, 667
" n "And now Hillary wants to surrender America to globalism just what we dont want, 667, 683
" n She wants a country without borders, 683, 691
She wants trade deals written for the benefit of foreign corporations, 691, 702
She wants a government that ignores the will of the people, 702, 713
 n She wants to sell out American security to the Clinton Foundation for a big fat pile of cash, 713, 732
 n "Its hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ends and where the State Department begins.n" According to the Associated Press more than half the meetings she took as secretary of state with people outside government were with foundation donors, 732, 772
 n Hillary Clinton does not believe in America first, 772, 781
We believe in America first, 781, 786
 n "Hillary believes in donors first and special interests and lobbyists, 786, 797
She will never straighten out our country, 797, 804
She doesnt have the strength the stamina or the ability to straighten out our country, 804, 819
Well have four more years of Obama and thats just what we dont want, 819, 833
" n She would rather give a job to a refugee from overseas than an unemployed American veteran or to an unemployed African American or Hispanic, 833, 859
 n The job of a public official is to serve and protect the citizens of the United States  n Not illegal immigrants not foreign nationals seeking entry but the people living here lawfully today including millions of African-American and Hispanic citizens millions millions being treated very very unfairly I can tell you that.n My focus will always be on the well-being of more than 300 million American citizens who call this country home and who love their country, 859, 937
 n I will fight for their security, 937, 944
I will fight for their jobs, 944, 950
We will not let jobs be taken out of our country be ripped out of our country and moved to Mexico and many other countries, 950, 975
We will not let it happen anymore, 975, 982
 n "Well be fighting for their jobs and well be fighting for your families that I can tell you, 982, 1001

Whats been going on ends on November 8th, 1003, 1011
" n We will have one American nation not divided we will be together, 1011, 1025
Hillary Clinton has betrayed her duty to the people, 1025, 1034
November 8th is our chance to re-declare American independence, 1034, 1043
 n This is a great honor for me, 1043, 1051
I am going right now to invite onto the stage the man behind Brexit and a man who led brilliantly the United Kingdom Independence Party in this fight and won despite all odds despite horrible name-calling despite so many obstacles.n Ladies and gentlemen Mr, 1051, 1095
Nigel Farage, 1095, 1097
  n Wow! Thank you Nigel.n What a job! What a job he did, 1097, 1110
What a job he did against all odds.n Thank you Nigel.n "That was some job that he did against all odds, 1110, 1131
Everybody said it couldnt be done, 1131, 1137
And by the way its looking like a very wise decision right now by the voters so I really congratulate Nigel and I thank you for being here, 1137, 1165
Thank you, 1165, 1167
" n "And if I may we had some tremendous polls come out today, 1167, 1181
I wont bring it up I refuse to mention it but they were very good, 1181, 1196
Were leading in a lot of locations, 1196, 1203
" n Thank you.n "Its time for America to recapture like you just heard to recapture our destiny, 1203, 1221
Our government leaders and our media have totally lost touch with the people, 1221, 1234
They have they have totally lost touch.n" "You need no better evidence of that then the fact that the media ignores the plight of Americans who have lost their children to illegal immigrants but spends day after day pushing for amnesty for those here in total violation of the law, 1234, 1284
We cant allow that, 1284, 1288
" n "Why do our leaders spend so much time talking about how to help people here illegally theyre here illegally and they spend and they work and they try so hard to help them but they dont try helping American citizens some of whom have been devastated by whats happened to their children and their families? Devastated.n" jobs wages and security for Americans, 1288, 1352
 n And the immigration policy I support as president must pass these three tests, 1352, 1366
First it must improve jobs and wages for United States citizens, 1366, 1377
 n We have people in this room who were making more money in real wages 18 years ago were not working as hard as theyre working now and theyve gotten older not supposed to be that way and in many cases and largely because of the disaster known as "Obamacare" they have to hold two jobs not one but two jobs and in some cases three jobs.n Not going to happen folks not going to happen.n Second it must improve the safety and security for United States citizens, 1377, 1465
 n Third it must improve the quality of life for U.S, 1465, 1476
citizens, 1476, 1477
The quality of life our quality of life is going down.n "Our level of security you look back years youre more insecure now in terms of security than you were 10 15 and 20 years ago.n" "Hillary Clintons radical immigration plan fails these tests and it fails them very very badly, 1477, 1528
Her push for open borders will lower the wages and kill the jobs of lawful American residents, 1528, 1545
" n Her support for catch-and-release will put innocent American lives at risk and already has just like President Obama released the illegal immigrant at the border who then killed magnificent magnificent Sarah Root.n Yesterday I met with her mom Michelle, 1545, 1586
Hillary Clinton only talks about the separation of families who choose to come here illegally, 1586, 1601
I want to focus on the American families who have been permanently separated from their children because of the sanctuary cities and open borders that Hillary Clinton so strongly supports, 1601, 1631
 n "Where is the sanctuary for American children? Where is that sanctuary? The dreamers we never talk about are the young Americans, 1631, 1653
Why arent young Americans dreamers also? I want my dreamers to be young Americans, 1653, 1667
" n Hillary Clinton also wants to push to bring in 620000 refugees in her first term  n A large number of whom come from large countries where women and gays are horribly brutalized which will weaken our tolerant way of life.n I only want to bring people to our country who share our values and love our people and are capable of loving America, 1667, 1732
 n Importantly I will also create millions and millions of jobs for our people, 1732, 1746
 n We are going to cut taxes reduce regulations fix our trade deals unleash American energy and repeal and replace the horror show known as "Obamacare."  n We are going to create jobs jobs jobs!  n I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created believe me, 1746, 1795
 n "So were going to have millions and millions of jobs jobs like you have never seen in this country before because our jobs are being stolen from us our companies are being stolen from us our manufacturing is down by 40 percent and 50 percent and numbers that nobody even believes, 1795, 1847
Those days will be over if Donald Trump is elected president of the United States believe me, 1847, 1864
" n "Rising incomes higher wages thousands of new companies all across this nation theyll come in and theyll form, 1864, 1884
We are going to renegotiate the worst trade deal ever made not only in this country but anywhere in the world known as NAFTA and signed by Bill Clinton, 1884, 1913
" n "Were going to stand up to China on trade, 1913, 1924
Were going to keep out of what will be a disastrous trade deal Trans-Pacific Partnership TPP, 1924, 1940
" n It will not happen with me, 1940, 1948
It will absolutely happen with crooked Hillary believe me.n "This state has lost more than 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton signed NAFTA and its lost one in four manufacturing jobs since he put China into the World Trade Organization both deals supported by Hillary Clinton, 1948, 1997
Horrible deals destructive deals what those deals have done to our jobs and to our country.n" We are going to bring back jobs to Mississippi  n "And in North Carolina which has treated me so well and Ohio and to Michigan where our auto plants are leaving and leaving and leaving and going to Mexico and other places and to Pennsylvania where I went to school and to Maryland and all across this land, 1997, 2071
Were going to bring our jobs back and were not going to let our jobs be taken away, 2071, 2089
" n Thank you, 2089, 2093
Thank you.n "And Im going to make it my personal mission to bring opportunity safety and prosperity to our very very troubled inner cities, 2093, 2117
" n The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community, 2117, 2129
 n "Democratic crime policies education policies and economic policies have produced only more crime more broken homes and more poverty than weve ever had in those communities before, 2129, 2157
" n Nearly four in 10 African-American children live in poverty, 2157, 2168
Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working, 2168, 2176
More than 2700 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of this year alone, 2176, 2192
 n "Violent crime has risen 17 percent and in Americas 50 largest cities its only going one way folks and thats up, 2192, 2214
Homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C, 2214, 2223
and more than 60 percent from last year in Baltimore.n" "The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African Americans totally for granted and theyve done nothing in return, 2223, 2252
" n "Theyve just assumed theyll get your support and theyve done nothing absolutely nothing to deserve it.n" "Its time to give the Democrats some competition for African- American votes and for Hispanic votes, 2252, 2286
" n "Its time to rebuild the inner cities of America and do it properly, 2286, 2301
Its time to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system, 2301, 2313
And I was the first to use that term its a rigged disgusting system, 2313, 2327
" n To those hurting and suffering and left behind I say what do you have to lose by trying something new? What do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump for president? What do you have to lose? I will fix the problem, 2327, 2373
I will fix the problem, 2373, 2378
 n If you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same horrible results.n But I also want to talk about what you have to gain right? Right? What do you have to gain? We will create school choice and allow charter schools to absolutely thrive, 2378, 2427
 n What else will we gain? We will empower young Americans to pursue their dreams of opening a small business and make it easier for them to get the credit that they need, 2427, 2460
 n We will renegotiate our horrible trade deals to bring back jobs and opportunity, 2460, 2474
And the African-American community and the Hispanic community will be our biggest beneficiary of that, 2474, 2489
 n We will lower taxes and unleash job creation and we will tap into trillions of dollars in new energy wealth that we never even knew we had before, 2489, 2518
 n We will protect your jobs from illegal immigration and broken visa programs, 2518, 2531
And we will rebuild the roads the bridges the infrastructure the tunnels the airports in your communities and we will rebuild it with our companies with our steel and with our labor, 2531, 2563
 n Hillary Clinton is a bigot who sees people of color  n "only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future, 2563, 2587
Shes going to do nothing for African Americans, 2587, 2595
Shes going to do nothing for the Hispanics, 2595, 2603
Shes only going to take care of herself her husband her consultants her donors, 2603, 2617
These are the people she cares about, 2617, 2624
She doesnt care what her policies have done to your communities, 2624, 2635
She doesnt care.n" "Remember this, 2635, 2640
Youve had her policies Democrats running some of the inner cities for 50 70 80 even over a hundred years, 2640, 2660
And look what you have right now poverty no education crime you cant walk down the street with your child, 2660, 2680
Were going to fix it were going to fix it, 2680, 2690
" n Hillary Clinton has no remorse, 2690, 2697
I will fight to create a better future for every American, 2697, 2708
The hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors are throwing money at Hillary Clinton to try and stop our change agenda.n Of course if they start looking at the polls they may stop doing that, 2708, 2743
 n "Theyre going to have to start studying those polls, 2743, 2753
Thats why you need to come out and you have to vote you have to vote, 2753, 2769
" n That is why you must make your voice heard on November 8th have to do it, 2769, 2787
 n Another crucial issue in this race is national security, 2787, 2797
Hillary Clinton may go down as the worst secretary of state that has ever served in that office, 2797, 2815
 n "Lets look back at the Middle East at the very beginning of 2009 before the Obama/Clinton administration that I call a catastrophe took over, 2815, 2840
Libya was stable, 2840, 2843
Syria was under control, 2843, 2847
Iraq was experiencing a reduction in violence, 2847, 2854
The group that would become what we now call ISIS was close to being extinguished would never have happened, 2854, 2873
Iran was being choked off by economic sanctions.n" Fast forward to today, 2873, 2885
After spending $4 trillion maybe $5 trillion nobody even knows how much money has been sucked out of our country what have the decisions of Obama/Clinton produced?n "Libya is in ruins, 2885, 2916
Our ambassador and three other brave Americans are dead, 2916, 2925
And ISIS has gained a new base of operations theyre all over the worldn" Syria is in the midst of a totally disastrous civil war, 2925, 2950
ISIS controls large portions of the territory.n "A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and is threatening the United States because Hillary is allowing these people to pour into our country and we dont know who they are where they come from, 2950, 2991
We know nothing.n" Iraq is in chaos and ISIS is on the loose.n ISIS has spread across the Middle East and into the west, 2991, 3015
At the same time ISIS is trying to infiltrate refugee flows into Europe and definitely folks definitely I have been very good at predicting definitely to the United States, 3015, 3044
 n "Iran has become the worlds largest state sponsor of terrorism is now flush with up to $150 billion in cash released by the United States plus another $400 million in cash cash cash ransom " n That President Obama said had nothing to do with ransom had nothing to do with the hostages and his own people said he was wrong, 3044, 3106
 n He lied, 3106, 3109
He lied, 3109, 3111
Just like he said Obamacare "keep your plan youll keep your doctor" 28 times "keep your plan keep your doctor." And because of that lie Democrats that would have never passed it passed it and now they regret that they passed it because it is a total disaster, 3111, 3159
 n Worst of all the nuclear deal puts Iran the number-one state sponsor of radical Islamic terrorism on a path to nuclear weapons, 3159, 3182
In short the Obama/Clinton foreign policy has unleashed ISIS destabilized the Middle East and put the nation of Iran which chants constantly chants "death to America" in a dominant position of regional power and in fact aspiring to be a dominant world power, 3182, 3225
And we put them there over the last three years!  n This is the legacy of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton: death destruction terrorism and weakness, 3225, 3251
 n "But Hillary Clintons legacy does not have to be Americas legacy, 3251, 3263
Were going to end the era of nation-building a disastrous concept a disastrous era and create new foreign policy joined by our partners in the Middle East that is focused completely on destroying ISIS, 3263, 3297
We have no choice destroying ISIS, 3297, 3303
" n We will extend a hand of friendship to any nation that will work with us in good faith on this vital mission.n I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our people our citizens trying to hurt the world but trying to hurt the United States: We will find you we will destroy you and we will win!  n Thank you, 3303, 3368
Thank you.n "This is not only a military fight but it will also require cyber warfare and financial warfare, 3368, 3387
Its also an ideological fight, 3387, 3392
We will confront directly the hateful its just so hateful ideology of radical Islam and promote American values and American culture and Americas system of government.n" Only by standing up for and supporting we have to stand up for and support our values can we become a united country once again  n A country of great jobs and wealth a country of security and freedom a country of strength and unity, 3392, 3463
The future is limitless, 3463, 3467
All we have to do is believe in America once again, 3467, 3478
We have to believe it can happen, 3478, 3485
It can happen, 3485, 3488
 n "We will put back our faith in Americas special destiny, 3488, 3499
We will lift the burdens on small business which is being driven into extinction by whats happening in our government, 3499, 3519
Well create a level playing field for American workers, 3519, 3528
Well never ever let whats happened to them happen to them again, 3528, 3540
Well establish justice and opportunity and safety in every community in the land.n" I am asking for the vote of every citizen in this country African American Hispanic all Americans all Americans who want a better brighter and stronger future for yourselves and for our country, 3540, 3586
 n I am the change candidate, 3586, 3592
This is our moment to show the whole world that America is back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, 3592, 3613
 n I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House, 3613, 3630
I will be your champion and I will work hard to be your champion.n "And I wont be playing golf instead of going to see the people in Louisiana who have been devastated by floods, 3630, 3665
" n "Im going to be the champion to every parent who dreams for their children, 3665, 3681
And to every child who dreams for their future I say these words to you tonight: I am with you I will fight for you and we will win for you we will win, 3681, 3715
" n Together we will make America strong again we will make America safe again we will make America great again.n Thank you and God bless you, 3715, 3742
