"This morning Donald Trump was asked point blank if he supported the Post-9/11 G.I, 0, 14
Bill and he said no, 14, 19
For a candidate who talks a big game about helping veterans this is a rather astonishing statement, 19, 36
As a veteran myself I understand just how instrumental this legislation has been in ensuring that the brave men and women who serve our country have every opportunity to succeed when they finish their service, 36, 71
Our vets simply cannot risk a president who doesnt understand their needs, 71, 83
Furthermore Trump falsely attacked Hillary Clintons commitment to veterans baselessly claiming that she thinks the vets are getting too much, 83, 103
That couldnt be further from the truth, 103, 110
As a Senator Hillary Clinton repeatedly worked across the aisle to successfully expand veterans benefits, 110, 125
And on this campaign she has laid out a comprehensive plan to enhance support for our veterans including a commitment to fight any efforts to the weaken the Post-9/11 G.I, 125, 155
Bill, 155, 156
Donald Trump should stop making false attacks stop offering empty rhetoric to our veterans and start offering them the respecting and support they deserve." ": On the military you raise an important issue, 156, 189
We tried to get your campaign and the other campaigns to hold forth on whether or not they supported the current G.I, 189, 211
bill, 211, 212
As you know in the Congress they did this sneaky vote in the House where there was no roll call and they were going to cut money from the G.I, 212, 242
bill to allow for other expenditures for vets, 242, 250
The vets were very upset, 250, 255
They said no dont take money from us and reallocate it, 255, 266
Find the savings elsewhere." Do you support maintaining the G.I, 266, 276
bill the way it is right now and even growing it instead of cutting it? ": I dont want to be hurting our vets, 276, 300
Our vets have been hurt enough, 300, 306
We treat illegal immigrants better than we treat our vets, 306, 316
So Im going to do nothing to hurt our vets, 316, 326
Im going to only help the vets --" : So is that a yes? -- ": -- unlike Hillary Clinton that thinks the vets are getting too much, 326, 354
And theyre not getting too much, 354, 360
Ive traveled Ive seen so many vets I know so many vets now and I have a lot of friends -- I have developed great friendships among the vets, 360, 389
Our vets are being treated so badly --" : So is that a yes I do support the current G.I, 389, 409
bill? : No, 409, 412
I want to bring jobs back to our country, 412, 421
