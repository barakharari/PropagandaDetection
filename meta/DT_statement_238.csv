"It is a great honor to have won both West Virginia and Nebraska especially by such massive margins, 0, 18
My time spent in both states was a wonderful and enlightening experience for me, 18, 32
I learned a lot and that knowledge will be put to good use towards the creation of businesses jobs and the strengthening and revival of their economies, 32, 59
I look forward to returning to West Virginia and Nebraska soon and hope to win both states in the general election, 59, 80
Likewise my time spent last week with the great people of Oregon will hopefully lead to another victory next Tuesday." - Donald J, 80, 103
Trump , 103, 104
