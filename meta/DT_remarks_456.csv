Thanks Maria for that introduction and for the work you and your organization do to honor these stolen American lives – and to advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims, 0, 32
I am honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced into the shadows, 32, 57
Your stories are not featured in the news you have no demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf you have no special interests taking up your cause and politicians ignore your cries for help, 57, 92
But I never will, 92, 96
"I have met many incredible people during the course of this campaign, 96, 108
But nothing has moved me more deeply than the time Ive spent with the families of the Remembrance Project and the incredible strength and courage youve shown in your often lonely fight for justice." You are heroes, 108, 145
And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers sisters sons daughters or parents, 145, 167
The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives, 167, 178
Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office, 178, 191
"Every day our border remains open innocent Americans are needlessly victimized, 191, 202
Every day Sanctuary Cities are left in place innocent Americans are put in harms way, 202, 217
Every day we fail to enforce our laws is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child." "Its happening every single day." All across this country dining room tables have an empty seat at the family dinner table because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce the laws, 217, 272
There are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate, 272, 282
But let me give you the most important number of all, 282, 293
That most important number of all is the number of American lives it is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration, 293, 316
Let me tell you what that number is: ZERO, 316, 325
Our nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws, 325, 342
What do you tell to the mother who just buried her daughter because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home? What do you tell to the young boy who will grow up without a dad because a criminal was deported five times but was allowed to keep coming back into the country? What do you tell the wife who has lost her husband because a Sanctuary City released an illegal immigrant from behind bars? This must end, 342, 424
And it must end right now, 424, 430
Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders, 430, 445
"Just look at whats happened in the last few days." Last week it was reported that authorities detained an illegal immigrant in the Austin area who is responsible for nearly a dozen sexual assaults and had been previously deported five times within a three-year period, 445, 490
"Earlier this week in Kansas a Sheriffs Department Master Deputy was killed apparently by an illegal immigrant, 490, 507
The driver was previously arrested for a DUI in California in 2001 and for a traffic violation in Kansas in 2013, 507, 528
Deputy Collins was killed only hours after his daughters fourth birthday." A few days ago two correctional officers in California were critically wounded after being shot by an illegal immigrant who overstayed his visa, 528, 562
This individual had been convicted for child rape and was slated to be deported – but his home country refused to take him back so he was simply released, 562, 591
One of the victims has six children is an Air Force Veteran and a high school football coach – the other victim is a mother and a grandmother, 591, 619
"When Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State the matter of this country refusing to take back their deported citizens came before Hillary Clintons desk, 619, 643
But she failed to take forceful action and ignored the federal law requiring her to suspend visas to countries that dont take back their citizens." "According to a report from the Boston Globe from the year 2008 through 2014 nearly 13000 criminal aliens were released back into U.S, 643, 691
communities because their home countries would not take them back, 691, 701
Most of these 13000 releases occurred on Hillary Clintons watch – she had the power and the duty to stop it cold and she didnt do it." Now my opponent will never meet with you, 701, 736
She will never hear your stories, 736, 742
She will never share in your pain, 742, 749
She will only meet with the donors and the special interests and the open border advocates, 749, 765
Her plan calls for total amnesty in the first 100 days which means Obamacare Social Security and Medicare for illegal immigrants, 765, 786
Her plan calls for catch-and-release on the border, 786, 794
Sanctuary Cities, 794, 796
Ignoring visa overstays, 796, 799
Closing detention centers, 799, 802
And a virtual end to immigration enforcement in the United States of America, 802, 815
Hillary Clinton has even announced that she plans to go around Congress and implement amnesty by executive order – violating our Constitution and putting the entire nation in grave peril, 815, 845
Hillary Clinton is the first person to ever run for the Presidency of a country effectively proposing to abolish the borders around that country, 845, 869
"But the media doesnt want you to know any of that, 869, 880
So theyll never ask her any questions about her plan, 880, 890
Like how shell afford to give lifetime welfare and entitlements to illegal immigrants or how many people will be victimized because of the illegal immigrants that will be released from federal custody – or at the border, 890, 927
Shes not asked to explain what shell say to the American workers who lose their jobs when she prints out millions of work permits for those here against the law." Your cause and your stories are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our border open at any cost, 927, 980
To them your presence is just too inconvenient, 980, 988
But help is coming, 988, 992
On November 8th we are going to win the White House and we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every American victim, 992, 1018
Together we will save American lives – and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate as the people in the room today, 1018, 1044
Since 2013 alone the Obama Administration has allowed 300000 criminal aliens to return back into U.S, 1044, 1060
communities – these are individuals encountered or identified by ICE but who were not detained or processed for deportation, 1060, 1079
"According to the federal governments own data there are more than 2 million convicted criminal illegal immigrants inside the United States right now, 1079, 1102
However this figure does not even include the many individuals who have committed crimes but escaped justice fled the jurisdiction or were otherwise never caught, 1102, 1127
Many crimes committed by people here illegally remain open cases." At the same time hundreds of individuals who have been given visas and refugee admissions into this country have subsequently been charged with terrorism, 1127, 1161
We are admitting people here with no idea who they are or what they believe, 1161, 1176
"Whether its drugs terrorism or violent crime our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country, 1176, 1201
The Border Patrol Agents who endorsed me warned that Hillary Clintons plan would put the entire country in grave danger – they called it radical deeply dangerous and warned it would trigger an unprecedented national crisis." "Lets just remember our goal – to prevent the next family from suffering the same terrible fate." That is what is at stake in this election, 1201, 1263
So I am now going to invite some of the bravest people I know to come up to the stage and speak, 1263, 1285
INVITE FAMILIES TO SPEAK These wounded American families have been alone, 1285, 1296
But they are alone no longer, 1296, 1302
I am here standing with you, 1302, 1308
The American people are here standing with you, 1308, 1316
And come November your long awaited day of justice will finally arrive, 1316, 1328
