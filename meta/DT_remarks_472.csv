"Thank you, 0, 2
Its so great to be in Wisconsin tonight." "A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll – and a new post-debate Google poll has leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide and thats despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton." On November 8th we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House, 2, 83
"Its going to be a victory for YOU the American people." We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service, 83, 110
Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself, 110, 124
I am an outsider fighting for you, 124, 131
One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country, 131, 149
Our good friend Sheriff Clarke is here with us tonight, 149, 159
"New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in Americas large cities and that its the largest single-year increase in 45 years." More than 3000 people have been shot in Chicago since January, 159, 194
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 194, 202
and more than 60% in Baltimore, 202, 208
Across the entire nation for cities of all sizes small and large the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year, 208, 230
This is a national crisis, 230, 235
Yet my opponent Hillary Clinton continues to attack the police, 235, 245
First she calls our supporters – many of them cops soldiers and firefighters – deplorable and irredeemable, 245, 262
Then in our debate this week she accusses the entire country including all of law enforcement of "implicit bias" – essentially suggesting that everyone including our police are basically racist and prejudiced, 262, 294
Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself, 294, 303
After all she is the one who described young African-American men as "super-predators." How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens? How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists deplorables and irredeemables? By smearing tens of millions of hardworking decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President, 303, 369
She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans of all backgrounds who just want to live in safety security and peace, 369, 393
The police officers she attacks are the same people – of all colors and nationalities – who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers, 393, 422
Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens, 422, 447
My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities, 447, 472
We are going to save thousands of lives, 472, 480
"The special interests the arrogant media and the political insiders dont want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities, 480, 509
They dont want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens, 509, 527
They just want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache." Well I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us, 527, 570
I will never back down from fighting to save American lives, 570, 581
"I will never back down from fighting to save Americas inner cities." The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks, 581, 609
Follow The Money, 609, 612
"Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for African-American communities, 612, 627
I dont think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart and they know they are being used, 627, 652
They also know that shell do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does and that will never change." Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over, 652, 707
"58% of African-American youth dont have jobs, 707, 714
There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours, 714, 723
45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty." The inner cities have been left behind, 723, 743
"Crime is through the roof public education is a disaster there are no jobs its dangerous to walk down the street with your child, 743, 767
To the African-American community I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump I will fix it." I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before, 767, 801
Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money, 801, 819
The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 819, 837
Follow The Money, 837, 840
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 840, 860
Follow The Money, 860, 863
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 863, 880
Follow The Money, 880, 883
The special interests who want open borders for cheap labor are donating to Hillary Clinton, 883, 898
Follow The Money, 898, 901
She and her financial backers will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country, 901, 928
In her campaign for President Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds, 928, 949
She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms, 949, 959
"She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office, 959, 978
Its all part of the rigged system being run at your expense." The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government, 978, 1005
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State, 1005, 1022
"And dont forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds, 1022, 1049
She even gave up 20% of Americas uranium supply to Russia." "She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance shed put the Oval Office up for sale too." She deleted and bleached 33000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, 1049, 1098
13 phones missing several destroyed with a hammer, 1098, 1106
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals, 1106, 1118
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server, 1118, 1127
Lies to Congress under oath about turning over her work-related emails, 1127, 1138
"The American people have had it with years decades of the Clintons scandals and corruption." This will be the year the American people said: Enough is enough, 1138, 1165
Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation, 1165, 1191
She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries, 1191, 1211
I am not running to be President of the World, 1211, 1221
I am running to be President of the United States of America, 1221, 1233
"From now on its going to be America First." "These special interests control Hillary Clinton, 1233, 1248
She is their chosen representative, 1248, 1253
You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money, 1253, 1267
Shes there for only one reason to protect her donors and collect their money." "Look at her career, 1267, 1285
Shes been there for 30 years and has never done anything for you and your family, 1285, 1301
Shes failed at everything, 1301, 1305
She failed in Iraq in Libya in Syria in Iran in Egypt, 1305, 1317
She failed on ISIS – in fact she unleashed ISIS onto the world." She failed upstate New York – promising 200000 jobs but instead the jobs left, 1317, 1344
All she did was name a post office and a highway, 1344, 1355
She failed the inner cities, 1355, 1360
"Shes failed women and children." The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors, 1360, 1377
"Our campaign is taking on big business big media and big donors – were taking them on for YOU, 1377, 1396
So you can have the future you want." "Im not owned or controlled by anyone – my loyalty is to you and no one else, 1396, 1421
I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU." My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 1421, 1441
We will cut your taxes reduce regulations negotiate great trade deals unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 1441, 1464
We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child – including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America, 1464, 1490
We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education and a great job, 1490, 1509
The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton, 1509, 1526
Follow the Money, 1526, 1529
"Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C, 1529, 1541
Were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives." "Theyre all part of the same rigged political establishment, 1541, 1567
They go to the same restaurants they attend the same conferences they have the same friends and connections, 1567, 1585
And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th." Government will start working for you again, 1585, 1606
Fixing things is what I do, 1606, 1612
Just look at my projects in New York and around the world where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines, 1612, 1632
"Thats what I want to do for our country – I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people." Together we can accomplish anything we want, 1632, 1665
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th – and it means you need to start voting early, 1665, 1688
Early voting is already underway, 1688, 1693
You have to knock on doors, 1693, 1699
You have to pick up that phone, 1699, 1706
You have to campaign on the streets, 1706, 1713
Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country, 1713, 1728
To beat the system you have to lift your voice pound the pavement and get out the vote, 1728, 1746
Visit our website to find out how you can help, 1746, 1756
You have six weeks until the election, 1756, 1763
You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true, 1763, 1779
You have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation, 1779, 1798
"Dont let it slip away, 1798, 1803
Dont let this chance go, 1803, 1808
Stand up and be heard – for your family for your city for your country." The arrogance of Washington D.C, 1808, 1828
will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 1828, 1842
This November 8th we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before, 1842, 1866
Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1866, 1938
We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1938, 1950
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1950, 1970
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1970, 1979
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy harvested from American sources will power this nation, 1979, 1997
American workers will be hired to do the job, 1997, 2006
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 2006, 2018
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans, 2018, 2040
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 2040, 2061
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 2061, 2083
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 2083, 2096
We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 2096, 2102
We Will Make America Strong Again, 2102, 2108
