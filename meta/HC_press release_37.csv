As a longtime admirer of her both personally—her ability to achieve that ever elusive white whale known as work-life balance as both a politician and a mother—and professionally (her track record of taking a stand for women and children) I was determined to be useful in any way I could, 0, 50
"I imagined this might take the form of a cheeky straight-to-camera endorsement or maybe an amusing T-shirt design but I never imagined I would be traveling to four or more cities a day to spread the word on why I vote why you should too and why Im supporting Hillary Clintons bid for the presidency, 50, 105
But when the lady asks I answer and I found myself heading to Boston with a massive torn garment bag (shout-out to the dude at Chicago OHare airport who taped it up!) and a much-practiced speech in my shaking hands." "I want to start this recap the way I started the remarks I delivered in Boston; Manchester New Hampshire; Portsmouth New Hampshire; Chicago; Iowa City; and Des Moines Iowa: by saying that involvement in politics came late for me, 105, 184
I didnt seize the opportunity to vote when I turned 18, 184, 195
Rather I had to be urged to give a darn about the electoral process in our country.?" "It was my friend Audrey Gelman who worked on Hillarys 2008 campaign as a junior press aide who told me point-blank in 2012 that if I didnt use my platform to talk about what mattered to me then I was basically voting for Mitt Romney, 195, 257
And especially as women who we vote for matters just as much as the issues we rally around, 257, 275
" So it was only fitting that Audrey join me on this trip often reminding me to reapply lipstick pull up my tights and carry my remarks in my purse, 275, 305
I thank her for encouraging me to pursue this incredibly gratifying aspect of my life, 305, 320
"A little more background: For those of you who dont know I interviewed Secretary Clinton for the inaugural issue of "  and that opportunity to speak with her for an hour about both the personal and the political really informed the words I shared with the young people—mostly young women—who I met during this whirlwind 48 hours, 320, 377
My first stop was Boston where I had the opportunity to speak to a group of Hillary supporters—most notably Barbara Lee a woman who has   make their way to office, 377, 407
Her aim is to research the roadblocks that keep women out of office and also to get a diverse range of female senators governors—and yes presidents—elected so the ratio of women to men in government can actually reflect our population.? Barbara also has my heart for another reason: She collects modern art by women including a piece by my mother (of a dancing little cake!) that hangs in her front hallway and she has made generous donations from her collection to the Boston Institute of Contemporary Art, 407, 494
"This event is where I linked up with Abby Wambach the remarkable (and recently retired) U.S, 494, 510
womens soccer star, 510, 513
She has the potential to be a cult religious leader thats how charismatic she is, 513, 528
Glad shes using her powers for good and stumping." In New Hampshire I executed a quick outfit change then zoned out on the nearest sofa, 528, 553
Abby caught this picture of me in a position that is very natural to me—reclining like a stressed snail, 553, 572
"After that Abby and I parted ways: She continued through New Hampshire (miss you Abby) and I stopped in Manchester before catching a plane to Chicago, 572, 598
The Chicago event was delightful and not only because I met the mother and daughter behind the famous Elis Cheesecake, 598, 618
They sent Audrey and me not one but FIVE cheesecakes.?" Here Audrey is celebrating this historic win in our hotel room, 618, 639
Iowa was next starting in Iowa City where I had lunch with a lovely woman named Sarah who talked frankly with me about her range of concerns as a soon-to-be mother of two   a Creative Commons lawyer and an Iowan, 639, 679
She also helped me wrap my head around the caucus process which is complex old-school and really instills a unique sense of political responsibility in the Iowans I met.? At the end of our journey Audrey bought and presented me with the book Caucus Chaos both a souvenir of our time and something I should read so that I can look incredibly smart at cocktail parties, 679, 745
"In Des Moines my event was at a very stylish Portlandia-esque silkscreen and design studio where I got a chance to meet Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richardss daughter Lily the director of communications for the campaign in Iowa.?" I was really thrilled to be making the rounds directly after Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary—their first primary endorsement in their hundred-year history, 745, 805
The adorable elves at the silkscreen studio made bags and T-shirts with this very personally pleasing image, 805, 822
"Before heading to the airport I hugged Casey the gentleman from the campaign who had been driving me in a minivan across the state, 822, 846
He loved my custom-knit Hillary sweater so much that I had no choice but to surrender it, 846, 863
I do feel its in good hands.?" "Doesnt he look pleased?" So .., 863, 876
what did I say to all these people? Why did I go to six cities take five planes give seven versions of this speech and compromise my already shitty immune system?? "It wasnt just for the cheesecake, 876, 913
Below is an abridged version of the remarks I shared, 913, 923
Although lots of these quotes have circulated in the media its always nice to give something context, 923, 940
Especially something as important as this ..." " I also have an opinion on who you should vote for, 940, 959
I have admired Hillary Clinton for many years—24 to be exact since I was six years old and she entered the White House as the first lady of the United States, 959, 990
Even as a child I was impressed not only by the poise with which she approached her position but also the ferocity, 990, 1012
Not content to hide her own accomplishments and cede her identity to her husband she used her time in the White House to help form the Department of Justices Office on Violence Against Women and to tell us that "  in her Beijing speech of 1995.? Secretary Clinton went on to have a political career that on its own terms is a radical accomplishment, 1012, 1076
As New York senator she introduced the CARE Act twice ensuring that rape and incest victims had access to emergency contraception in hospital emergency rooms, 1076, 1101
As secretary of state she continued to battle against violence toward women spearheading a U.N, 1101, 1116
resolution that established guidelines for an international response to sexual assault in war-torn areas.? "Through her travel writing and the Clinton Foundation she has worked tirelessly for causes ranging from AIDS research to closing the word gap for low-income families and making reading a part of every childs life, 1116, 1165
Her conviction is moving; her tenacity astounding." "Its no secret that womens rights matter to me, 1165, 1181
Its why my Twitter feed is littered with insanity and my underpants say feminist on the butt (NOTE: I packed several pairs of these, 1181, 1205
They make me feel good .., 1205, 1211
.)?" "Womens rights matter to me more than anything in the world because as HRC said womens rights are human rights, 1211, 1232
Womens equality allows our children to grow up strong and protected without fear, 1232, 1245
" ? " When we sat together this past September for an hour-long interview I saw how clearly she understood the connection between womens rights and the Black Lives Matter movement and how committed she is to bringing young disenfranchised voters back into an active dialogue with politics.?" We discussed a range of other essential issues—student debt universal health care gun control and campus assault to name a few—and she impressed me time and again with her clear-eyed   for tackling these murky and challenging issues issues that so often feel powerfully divisive and impossible to surmount, 1245, 1341
"I cant talk about Hillary Clinton without saying that she has also survived horrific gendered attacks on every aspect of her character with unimaginable aplomb, 1341, 1366
The way she has been treated by the media is just more evidence of the anger that exists toward women particularly ambitious women and the way we are not allowed to exist on our own merits but rather as extensions of men in power, 1366, 1410
Hillary Clinton has roundly rejected this premise and she is running for president again, 1410, 1424
As a newly grown-up woman who has experienced my fair share of backlash of public body shaming of puritanical judgments that moves me." "Nothing gets me angrier than when someone implies that Im voting for Hillary Clinton simply because shes female as if I have some feminist version of beer goggles—lets call it estrogen blindness, 1424, 1479
This assumption is condescending at best and hideously misogynistic at worst, 1479, 1490
The fact is there are plenty of women whose politics horrify me just as there are plenty of men who I would love to see in elected office, 1490, 1518
" "But I will end with this: We live in a country where women still battle daily for our basic rights, 1518, 1539
Whether its wage equality access to birth control or the right to press charges against our rapists with a measure of support and dignity women are having to run twice as fast as their male counterparts just to stay in one place, 1539, 1581
So while Hillary Clintons anatomy is not the reason Im voting for her " ? , 1581, 1596
