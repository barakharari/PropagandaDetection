I am going to fight so hard for all of you and I am going to bring back the jobs that have been stripped away from you and your country, 0, 30
In 39 days we are going to win the state of Michigan and we are going to win the White House, 30, 51
It is going to be a victory for YOU the American people, 51, 63
We are going to take on the special interests the lobbyists and the powerful politicians that have stolen your jobs your wealth and your middle class, 63, 89
We are going to take on the arrogant corrupt corporate media that have enabled the global theft of American prosperity – a theft that has left behind crumbling schools roads bridges and a depleted military, 89, 124
It is time to rebuild Detroit, 124, 130
It is time to rebuild Michigan, 130, 136
It is time to rebuild the United States of America, 136, 146
"Hillary Clinton has made a living raking in donations from special interests that have ripped the jobs right out of Michigan, 146, 167
These are the people whose policies raided the jobs from Detroit, 167, 178
Thats how she gets rich – by taking your jobs and your money away from you." Thats why Hillary Clinton if she ever got the chance would 100% approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 178, 210
The deal she called the "Gold Standard." The TPP will economically devastate Michigan New Hampshire North Carolina Pennsylvania Wisconsin and so many other states across this country, 210, 237
"Hillary Clintons donors want the TPP – and their wish is her command." "These special interests pay her for speeches, 237, 257
They pay her Foundation, 257, 261
They pay her husband, 261, 265
In return they GET YOUR JOBS, 265, 271
Like Ive been saying all week when it comes to Hillary Clinton all you have to do is remember these words: FOLLOW THE MONEY." "Hillary Clinton praised or pushed TPP on 45 separate occasions, 271, 305
Her close associate and confidant Terry McAuliffe said shed pass it, 305, 316
Her husband has talked it up, 316, 322
Everyone knows shes for it because she doesnt believe in protecting American Sovereignty." Hillary Clinton only believes in protecting one thing: her donors, 322, 345
Of the 262 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP 82 or nearly 1 in 3 donated between $21 and $67 million to the Clinton Foundation, 345, 372
9 companies that lobbied for the passage of TPP paid Hillary Clinton $2.7 million for paid speeches, 372, 389
Of the 12 signatory countries that are parties to TPP 3 gave between $6 and $15 million to the Clinton Foundation, 389, 410
At least 4 lobbyists who are actively lobbying for TPP passage have raised more than $800000 for her campaign, 410, 429
On November 8th We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and we are going to do something that has been a long long time coming: WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICA FIRST, 429, 462
Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors, 462, 475
I am an outsider fighting for you, 475, 482
Hillary Clinton is the one who rigged the system, 482, 491
"We are the ones who are going to change the system so its fair and just for every American." We have a movement, 491, 514
The corrupt establishment is panicking because they know how hard it is to stop us, 514, 529
The news anchors and the donors and the lobbyists who are used to getting their way are trying to do everything they can to help Hillary Clinton and to cling to their power and prestige, 529, 564
"The arrogant political class doesnt believe in protecting jobs and wages for Americans." "They dont believe in secure borders and strong walls." "These Washington and Wall Street insiders dont believe in hiring more police producing more American energy or giving school choice to poor children trapped in failing schools." "For decades weve talked about the corruption incompetence and failures of our leaders, 564, 626
2016 is our long-awaited chance to fix the problem – and to hold our politicians accountable, 626, 642
If you do this one simple thing you can deliver justice for every single person who has been wronged by the system: show up and vote." "When you cast that ballot just picture a Wall Street boardroom filled with the special interests who have been bleeding this county dry and imagine the look on their faces when you tell all of them: youre fired." In their place will be a new government, 642, 714
We are the Party of Abraham Lincoln and once again we will have a government of by and for the people, 714, 735
We are going to do it together, 735, 742
In 39 days everything is going to change, 742, 750
"Now the media doesnt want to talk about Hillary Clinton and her corruption, 750, 763
So we are going to spell it out for them today." The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that ship your jobs overseas – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 763, 794
Follow the money, 794, 797
The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 797, 817
Follow the money, 817, 820
The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton, 820, 837
Follow the money, 837, 840
The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton, 840, 852
Follow the money, 852, 855
In her campaign for President Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds, 855, 876
She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office, 876, 891
The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government, 891, 906
Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State, 906, 923
Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks, 923, 933
"She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance shed put the Oval Office up for sale too." She deleted and bleached 33000 emails after a Congressional subpoena, 933, 971
13 phones missing several destroyed with a hammer, 971, 979
Her staffers taking the fifth amendment and her ringleaders getting immunity deals, 979, 991
Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server, 991, 1000
Lies to Congress under oath about turning over her work-related emails, 1000, 1011
"We are going to call them the FBI Immunity Five, 1011, 1021
So heres my question for Hillary Clinton: can you promise that not one of the five people who were granted criminal immunity will ever be allowed to serve in a Clinton Administration?" And here is the demand I am making today to President Obama: will you pledge here and now not to issue a pardon to Hillary Clinton and her co-conspirators for their many crimes against our country and society itself? No one is above the law, 1021, 1098
Not even Hillary Clinton, 1098, 1102
Clinton and her cronies will say anything do anything lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country, 1102, 1128
Remember the Clinton pardon of fugitive Marc Rich in exchange for unknown and undisclosed amounts of money? The American people have had it with years decades of Clinton Corruption and scandals, 1128, 1159
They are tired of the lies they are tired of the trivial politics they are tired of being talked down to looked down upon and treated like second class citizens, 1159, 1189
This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough, 1189, 1201
Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities but especially for African-American communities, 1201, 1216
I dont think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart and they know they are being used, 1216, 1241
They also know that shell do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does and that will never change, 1241, 1264
Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men "super-predators." To the African-American community let me ask you this question: are you better off than you were eight years ago? If not vote for Donald Trump, 1264, 1302
I will bring jobs great education and safe neighborhoods, 1302, 1311
If you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same results, 1311, 1326
"Look at what the Democrats have done to Detroit, 1326, 1335
Half of Detroit residents do not work, 1335, 1342
Nearly 40% of the city lives in poverty, 1342, 1350
Its the second most dangerous city in America according to the FBI." This is the legacy of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton, 1350, 1373
A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people, 1373, 1384
My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs jobs jobs, 1384, 1399
We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, 1399, 1411
Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, 1411, 1419
We will unleash the power of American energy, 1419, 1427
The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced, 1427, 1437
And the disastrous trade deals like NAFTA that have caused so much pain in Michigan will be renegotiated – and we will bring back your auto-manufacturing, 1437, 1463
"Michigan has lost more than 1 in 3 of its manufacturing jobs since the twin disasters of NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the WTO – both deals pushed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton." Before NAFTA went into effect there were 280000 auto workers in Michigan, 1463, 1511
Today that number is only 160000, 1511, 1517
Ford is moving its small car production to Mexico, 1517, 1526
"It used to be that the cars were made in Flint and you couldnt drink the water in Mexico, 1526, 1545
Today the cars are made in Mexico and you cant drink the water in Flint." Hillary Clinton also gave us the job-killing trade deal with South Korea which has cost this country another 100000 jobs, 1545, 1580
Hillary opposed the Korea deal when she was running for President in 2007, 1580, 1593
She campaigned right here in Michigan and said the Korea deal "will hurt the us auto industry increase our trade deficit cost us good middle-class jobs and make America less competitive." She pledged to reject the deal, 1593, 1630
But she lied to all of you just like she lied about her emails, 1630, 1644
Once installed as Secretary of State she supported it and called it a "cutting-edge deal." She rammed it through to adoption – she always does whatever the donors tell her to do no matter how it impacts our families schools and communities, 1644, 1686
The U.S, 1686, 1688
trade deficit with Korea in the top ten products that Michigan exports to Korea grew 54 percent as exports fell and imports rose, 1688, 1711
This is what Hillary Clinton did to your state, 1711, 1720
According to the Economic Policy Institute Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members and the country lost 740000 manufacturing jobs as a result of that deficit last year, 1720, 1760
Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved as Hillary Clinton is planning to do, 1760, 1783
Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth its jobs and its status as a sovereign nation, 1783, 1810
She even supports the disastrous surrender of Americas control of the internet which is happening tomorrow, 1810, 1826
Hillary Clintons website says she supports the decision to give away the internet to a "global community of stakeholders." Someone needs to inform Hillary Clinton its not the job of our leaders to represent a "global community." Its the job of our leaders to represent American citizens, 1826, 1873
Losing control of the internet to other foreign entities is just one more way Obama-Clinton have sold out the citizens of this country, 1873, 1896
Hillary Clinton is a globalist who will never protect the freedom and jobs of the American people, 1896, 1913
I am not running to be President of the World, 1913, 1923
I am running to be President of the United States of America, 1923, 1935
Have you ever wondered why it is that all the things that the American people want never seem to happen? "The reason for this is simple, 1935, 1961
Its because the financial interests who control our politics and our media dont want these changes to happen." Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and has never done anything for you and your family, 1961, 1997
"Just look at how badly she messed up on the Iran deal, 1997, 2009
And just today we learned that on the same day as the hostages were released the United States signed an agreement lifting sanctions on two Iranian banks involved in financing Irans missile programs." Hillary Clinton is there for only one reason to protect her donors and collect their money, 2009, 2058
"Our campaign is taking on big business big media and big donors – were taking them on for YOU, 2058, 2077
So you can have the future you want." "Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington D.C, 2077, 2097
Were trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors the large corporations and the media executives." "Theyre all part of the same corrupt political establishment, 2097, 2123
And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable." I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country, 2123, 2151
Together we can accomplish anything we want, 2151, 2158
But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th, 2158, 2171
You have 39 days until the election, 2171, 2178
You have 39 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true, 2178, 2194
Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away, 2194, 2201
You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this nation, 2201, 2219
The arrogance of Washington D.C, 2219, 2224
will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 2224, 2238
On November 8th we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before, 2238, 2262
Here are just some of the great things that will happen for your country: We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring our manufacturing jobs back to Michigan; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 2262, 2344
We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 2344, 2356
American cars – made in Michigan – will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 2356, 2381
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 2381, 2390
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy mined from American sources will power this nation, 2390, 2408
American workers will be hired to do the job, 2408, 2417
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 2417, 2429
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans, 2429, 2451
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 2451, 2472
To the people of Michigan I promise you this – We will make America wealthy again, 2472, 2488
We will make America strong again, 2488, 2494
We will make America safe again, 2494, 2500
And we will make America great again, 2500, 2507
Thank you and God Bless! , 2507, 2512
