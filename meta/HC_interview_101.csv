" Well what do you say we talk to Hillary Clinton whos good enough to join us this morning on a very important and busy day, 0, 26
Thank you so much for doing that, 26, 33
And so do you have the victory party all set for tonight?" " Well this is a very tight race Robin, 33, 54
Its really going down to the wire, 54, 61
But we feel very good weve worked so hard, 61, 70
Ive had a great operation here, 70, 76
So many young people organizers who fanned out across the state the thousands of volunteers, 76, 91
We did knock on 125000 doors this past weekend, 91, 100
So were very committed very energized and enthusiastic but it all depends upon who shows up tonight who comes out to caucus in Iowa, 100, 124
And Im urging everyone who is interested in committed to caucusing for me to please be there tonight 6:30, 124, 143
I will be there in spirit because if you stand up for me I will stand up for you during this campaign and into the White House." " You know there are so many similarities between what is going on right now and eight years ago, 143, 189
You again are affected — unexpected challenge that you are facing, 189, 200
What are the differences and similarities between what youre experiencing now and what happened eight years ago here in Iowa?" " Well I think that I have a much better organization to be just really clear about it, 200, 238
I think that we built an organization using a lot of the lessons learned and we recruited some of the best people that you could find anywhere in the country working in Democratic politics, 238, 272
I think Im a better candidate, 272, 278
I think that in addition to just knowing more about the caucus process and what we needed to do to build toward this night, 278, 302
My experience as secretary of State really deepened and intensified my understanding about what the next president will have to face, 302, 323
So all in all I feel like its a different energized effort that is really bringing in people from across the state and indeed across the country who know whats at stake in this election understand how really dramatic and drastic it would be if the Republicans were to take back the White House because they would rip out the progress, 323, 384
We wouldnt be able to in my view get the economy going for everybody get incomes rising get affordable college take care of the rising prescription drug costs everything Im talking about which is really in response to the concerns and the worries that I hear from people as I criss-cross this state." " All 99 counties you have criss-crossed and we have seen you and weve seen your husband and weve seen your daughter as well, 384, 461
"  " Well I havent gotten to all 99."  A third of — " I had to — lets just say that, 461, 483
I dont want anybody to think that my silence is affirmation, 483, 494
But Ive covered a lot of ground and I sure have met many thousands of people and have really learned so much, 494, 516
You know thats the best part of this, 516, 524
Its obviously exhausting it takes a lot of concentration, 524, 533
But what keeps me going are the stories that people tell me, 533, 545
Theres something so intimate at least in my experience because I actually try to listen to people and hear whats on their minds when someone tells you about the open heart surgery that their granddaughter had to have as a baby and how they couldnt have afforded it without the Affordable Care Act or when a young woman says shes just drowning in student debt and needs a way out that sticks with me, 545, 619
And I think that the months Ive spent here listening to Iowans has really made me a better candidate and I think it will make me a better president." " Well speaking of listening to Iowans we have John Karl, 619, 659
He is out and about and he is with some voters, 659, 670
And you know a third of voters here are undecided and lets hear what one voter has to ask you, 670, 690
John?" " Hello Robin hello Secretary Clinton, 690, 697
Were with Rob here from Dennison Iowa, 697, 704
Incredible thing about this, 704, 708
Rob you were undecided between Hillary Clinton and John Kasich, 708, 718
So you dont even know which party — whats your question for Secretary Clinton?" " Good morning Secretary Clinton, 718, 737
My question for you is as a liberal Republican — it seems to be a dying breed anymore — I want to know how youre going to work bipartisanly with a very partisan Congress and a — and a seemingly polarized nation."  Good question, 737, 781
" Thats a — thats a really great question and thanks for asking it because I get asked that a lot, 781, 802
You know I have a record of working with Republicans, 802, 812
When Im actually in a position to do so — when you know theres a campaign its a little bit different — but when I was first lady I worked to achieve the Childrens Health Insurance Program working across the aisle with both Republicans and Democrats even reformed our foster care and adoption system teaming up with Tom DeLay a very partisan Republican in the House, 812, 878
And when I got to the Senate I worked hard to get health care for the National Guard and Reserves I worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in that case, 878, 907
And I — I dont know that there was a single Republican who didnt co-sponsor one of the bills that I worked on, 907, 930
And as secretary of State I had similar efforts to reach common ground that proved successful, 930, 946
I know in a campaign that distinctions have to be drawn because we have to give voters a real sense of what each of us wants to do and to hold us accountable for the agenda we put forth, 946, 985
But I am confident that Im going to work really hard to find that common ground across the aisle and we will make progress together."  Secretary Clinton thank you very much, 985, 1016
We appreciate you joining us on this very busy and important day, 1016, 1028
Thank you, 1028, 1030
 Thanks so much, 1030, 1033
Great to talk to you, 1033, 1038
 You as all — as always, 1038, 1044
