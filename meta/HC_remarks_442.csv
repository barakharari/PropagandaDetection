Thank you so much! Thank you, 0, 6
Wow thank you all, 6, 10
What a great way to celebrate my birthday being here in Tampa!n "I am so so grateful to José for that wonderful introduction, 10, 33
Hes an incredibly talented chef but more than that I have to say hes a humanitarian, 33, 49
He just came back from Haiti once again where he goes periodically to help feed people, 49, 65
Hes been doing it ever since the terrible earthquake going to help people in remote villages – and he does that all over the world when it comes to making sure that there are clean cookstoves so that people can cook primarily women and children without fear of getting sick from inhaling all the smoke, 65, 120
I enlisted Josés help when I was Secretary of State on the clean cookstoves initiative, 120, 135
And as you heard hes also a proud immigrant and – he is standing up to Donald Trumps anti-immigrant rhetoric and hes doing it in a very courageous way because he sacrificed his business, 135, 169
Hed been asked by the Trump Organization to put a restaurant into the new hotel that Trump was talking about on TV today in Washington and after José heard the kinds of things that Donald Trump was saying about immigrants he said No I refuse to open a restaurant in that hotel, 169, 221
That is really gutsy.n" And today was a perfect time to have José be with us because as I said Donald Trump is taking time off the campaign trail to officially open the hotel, 221, 255
And yesterday here in Florida he took time out to invite the press to listen to his employees talk about what a great boss he is while he was watching and listening to them.n "And today in opening that hotel I think its important to note that he once again relied on undocumented workers, 255, 309
The same people he has been insulting and demonizing throughout this campaign, 309, 321
So like with so much else that Donald Trump says he says one thing and then he does something different, 321, 341
Many of the products in the hotel were made overseas rather than here in the United States and he even sued the District of Columbia to pay lower taxes, 341, 370
That is the way that he does business.n" "Now weve actually learned in this campaign that Donald Trump is the poster boy for everything wrong with our economy, 370, 398
He refuses to pay workers and contractors from Atlantic City to Miami to Las Vegas, 398, 413
He stiffs small businesses, 413, 417
I take that one personally because my dad was a small businessman, 417, 429
And Ive met so many people who did projects for Donald Trump – provided pianos for one of his casinos installed drapes for one of his hotels laid the marble put in the glass washed the dishes painted – and then werent paid, 429, 472
I just think that is fundamentally wrong and that is not the kind of experience we need in the Oval Office.n" "So Im grateful to José and I want to thank everyone else – my great friend your United States Senator Bill Nelson, 472, 515
Congresswoman Kathy Castor, 515, 518
Mayor Bob Buckhorn whos here with his two daughters, 518, 527
Governor Charlie Crist soon to be Congressman Charlie Crist, 527, 536
I have to say weve got two great candidates here: David Singer candidate for the House of Representatives; and Rena Frazier another candidate, 536, 559
And we have the great talent of Angela Bassett with us today.n" "So my friends heres the advice that I got, 559, 580
It is a beautiful day in Tampa but its warm, 580, 590
And some of you have been here a while right? And Im watching the flags, 590, 605
So long as theyre waving I know theres a breeze, 605, 615
If they stop waving Im really going to cut this short.n" But let me start by thanking you – thanking you for being here.n  n "Thank you, 615, 642
Thank you, 642, 644
Well Ill tell you if I ever need a pickup Im coming back to Tampa Mayor, 644, 660
And with 13 days left in this election we cannot stop for a minute, 660, 674
No complacency here, 674, 677
Nobody— nobody flagging, 677, 680
Weve got to get everybody out to vote, 680, 688
And I hope in addition to the people that Ive mentioned someone whos not here I hope you will support – that is Congressman Patrick Murphy to send him to the United States Senate.n" "I think youll be pleased because hes an independent voice, 688, 732
Hes a problem-solver, 732, 735
He believes in comprehensive immigration reform, 735, 741
He has stood with Planned Parenthood against the attacks that it has suffered, 741, 754
He has even brought Democrats and Republicans together to try to protect our environment and fund Everglades restoration, 754, 772
Hell stand up to the gun lobby and advocate for common sense gun safety measures, 772, 787
Hell defend Social Security and Medicare not cutting or privatizing those two essential programs, 787, 801
So please do your best to make sure we send Patrick Murphy to the Senate.n" Now I got to ask you anybody see the last debate? You know I have now stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours proving conclusively I have the stamina to do the job.n "And every time he says one of those outrageous things that he does have a – yeah Wrong – he does have a way of saying I just keep remembering Michelle Obamas words: when he goes low we go high.n" "But I got to say he said something in the last debate weve never heard from anybody running for president, 801, 913
He basically said that hes not sure – he refused to say that he would respect the results of the election, 913, 934
Now this is a guy who said the Emmys were rigged so you cant really take what he says very seriously, 934, 955
But this is a problem because the first thing a president does at noon on January 20th is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the Constitution, 955, 984
And if you are casting doubts you want to keep people in suspense as to whether you will respect the outcome of an election that is contrary to who we are as Americans, 984, 1017
We have our elections; weve had them from George Washington forward, 1017, 1028
Were going to keep having them and show what a democracy looks like to the rest of the world.n" "I believe strongly that the American people are going to reject this dark divisive vision of America and its happening my friends, 1028, 1069
We have reached a milestone, 1069, 1074
More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote, 1074, 1083
Thats the biggest number ever, 1083, 1088
And that number includes 50 million young people, 1088, 1096
And you know what else? More than 10 million people have already voted including 2 million right here in Florida.n" "Im hearing some great stories from people, 1096, 1123
Let me just tell you one, 1123, 1129
Its about Steven from St, 1129, 1134
Augustine, 1134, 1135
Hes been fighting a rare form of leukemia and heart disease, 1135, 1146
Hes been in and out of the hospitals a dozen times in the last two years, 1146, 1162
But he knows how important his vote is, 1162, 1170
So I heard yesterday he ditched his oxygen tank which I would not have recommended – clung to his walker stood in line so he could cast his vote for a better America, 1170, 1203
And if Steven can do that nobody has any excuses, 1203, 1213
And I think this extends not just to Democrats but to Republicans and independents and I am proud to have support from Republicans and independents here across Florida and across America who agree with me that we should reject hate and division.n" "We have seen Donald Trump insult nearly every person in America and I just find that so intolerable, 1213, 1273
Because look at this diverse crowd; look at Tampa, 1273, 1282
Its a cosmopolitan city, 1282, 1286
Florida is paving the way for what our country will look like and we need to be lifting each other up listening to each other respecting each other not sowing seeds of hatred and bigotry, 1286, 1321
And I think one of my biggest jobs after this election will be bringing our country together and Im going to need your help.n" "Were going to get the economy working for everybody not just people at the top with new jobs in infrastructure, 1321, 1365
That rail system Bob that you want were going to get it because it would help you so much, 1365, 1384
Think of the people wed put to work – technology innovation research advanced manufacturing and yes small business, 1384, 1402
I want to be the best small business president you can have to help people start and grow their businesses, 1402, 1422
But were also going to make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, 1422, 1437
I know we can create millions of jobs and we can protect Florida especially coastal Florida and we can protect our planet at the same time, 1437, 1463
Youre already seeing the results of climate change here in Florida, 1463, 1474
I was just in Miami and they actually have flooding on sunny days with no rain, 1474, 1490
People are calling 3-1-1 because they think a water main broke but its the oceans rising, 1490, 1506
So I know there is no state that could benefit more from a clean energy agenda than Florida and thats exactly what were going to do.n" "Were also going to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, 1506, 1542
If your family makes less than $125000 which is most families in America youre not going to have to pay a penny to go to a public college or university, 1542, 1572
If your family makes more than that youre not going to have to go into debt – pay what you can afford and then were going to make sure you can go without getting a big debt because that drags people down, 1572, 1614
And for people who already have debt we are going to help you refinance it and pay it off.n" "And I want to say something to all of the teachers and educators, 1614, 1646
I want to work with you and be a good partner with you, 1646, 1659
And I think there should be more than one way more than just a four-year college degree to get a good job with a good middle-class life for you and your families, 1659, 1691
So lets invest in more technical education in high school in our community colleges, 1691, 1705
Lets have more apprenticeship programs – labor and business together.n" "But while we grow the economy lets make it fairer, 1705, 1725
We need to raise the national minimum wage so that people who work full-time arent left in poverty, 1725, 1743
I got to tell you I was raised to believe in hard work, 1743, 1756
My grandfather was a factory worker my dad had a small business and we really believed youve got to work for what you get in life right? But if youre working you shouldnt be at the point where you cannot even afford food or clothes or rent at the end of the year.n" "And isnt it finally time to guarantee equal pay for womens work? You know this is not just a womens issue, 1756, 1830
This is a family issue, 1830, 1835
If youve got a mother a wife a sister or a daughter working its your issue, 1835, 1851
And unlike my opponent were going to ask the wealthy the millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share because were going to close the loopholes and make sure no multimillionaire ever pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a teacher or a police officer or a firefighter, 1851, 1901
And I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $250000 a year.n" "So when you go to the polls vote to grow the economy more jobs with rising incomes vote to make the economy fairer, 1901, 1938
And compare that with what my opponent has proposed, 1938, 1947
He really believes if you give trillions – thats trillions with a t – trillions in tax cuts to the wealthy millionaires billionaires big corporations everything will trickle down, 1947, 1976
Now we know that doesnt work; weve seen it, 1976, 1985
And its pretty rich coming from a guy who claims to be so rich who hasnt paid a dime in federal income taxes in 20 years, 1985, 2011
He says not making taxes makes him smart, 2011, 2019
Well I dont know, 2019, 2023
I dont know how smart you have to be to lose a billion dollars in one year, 2023, 2040
And besides what kind of genius loses money running a casino for heavens sakes?n" "Actually it sounds like a few people have been at casinos here, 2040, 2066
But this means hes contributed zero okay? He actually has the gall to call our military a disaster, 2066, 2084
Not only is he wrong but what right does he have to say that? He hasnt contributed a penny to our military not a penny to our veterans not a penny to health care or education not a penny to highways or infrastructure, 2084, 2127
This is a false – false – charge that he makes about all the problems in our country.n" "And Ill tell you something; we did a little research, 2127, 2155
Hes been denigrating America for decades, 2155, 2161
This didnt start with his birther lie against President Obama, 2161, 2171
It didnt even start running against me, 2171, 2178
Back in 1987 he took out a $100000 ad in The New York Times criticizing President Reagan, 2178, 2195
He said our leaders were the laughing stock of the world, 2195, 2206
So this is a guy who criticizes everybody but himself, 2206, 2216
And at some point you got to say wait a minute were better than that, 2216, 2231
We are stronger than that, 2231, 2236
We want to forward – forward – into the future with confidence and optimism and thats what were offering in this campaign.n" "I got to tell you it is not just what were against that should motivate you to go to the polls; its what we are for, 2236, 2284
And I believe strongly that what were for will make it possible for all of us and especially our kids and our grandkids to have the best future, 2284, 2312
Americas best days can still be ahead of us, 2312, 2321
But we cant make any of this happen if we dont have you voting.n" "Now Donald Trump says he can still win and hes right, 2321, 2346
Thats why its so important everyone gets out and votes, 2346, 2356
And here in Florida – in a lot of places you can only vote on Election Day but here in Florida voting couldnt be easier, 2356, 2381
Early voting began on Monday, 2381, 2386
In south Florida it goes through Sunday November 6 around the state, 2386, 2398
You can go to an early voting site between 7:00 a.m, 2398, 2409
and 7:00 p.m, 2409, 2412
In fact the County Center on East Kennedy Boulevard is just a 10-minute walk from here, 2412, 2428
You can go vote right after this event, 2428, 2436
And well have staff ready to help you get there, 2436, 2446
And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make a plan to vote.n" "But I also hope you will volunteer these last two weeks, 2446, 2474
Were reaching out to everybody, 2474, 2479
So go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer, 2479, 2488
Take out your phone and text J-O-I-N and that is 47246, 2488, 2499
We can use you, 2499, 2503
Were making millions of phone calls in Florida, 2503, 2511
Were knocking on maybe by the time we finish millions of doors.n" We dont want anybody to be left out or left behind because on January 20th America will have a new president, 2511, 2544
Ive got to say – so Ive got to say to you that change is inevitable in life, 2544, 2562
Right? And so the real question is what kind of change are we going to have? And I want you to talk to anybody you know who is either thinking of not voting or maybe thinking of voting for my opponent, 2562, 2603
No, 2603, 2604
Im serious, 2604, 2606
Im serious, 2606, 2608
After this election if Im fortunate enough to be elected we are going to reach out to everybody, 2608, 2626
Right? And ask, 2626, 2629
Ask the people youre talking to what kind of change they really want because I dont think most Americans want the kind of divisive and dark change Donald Trump is offering: mass deportations that will rip families apart a repeal of gun-free school zones on day one going back to the day when insurance companies could discriminate against us if we have a preexisting condition letting Wall Street write its own rules denying the science of climate change rolling back marriage equality defunding Planned Parenthood the hugest tax breaks ever for the wealthy and abroad abandoning our alliances and allowing more countries to get nuclear weapons."n  "No."n  "Now that may be change but boy thats not the change we need, 2629, 2749
And my vision is different, 2749, 2754
Its more hopeful optimistic and unifying, 2754, 2760
I want us to be a country where every student could afford to go to college if thats what you choose, 2760, 2781
I want us to be a country where millions of people are working in good high-paying jobs and in new industries like clean energy and advanced manufacturing, 2781, 2808
I want us to be a country where hard-working immigrants who pay taxes – and by the way one-half of undocumented workers pay federal income taxes which means they are paying more federal income taxes than Donald Trump paid, 2808, 2847
And a country where we not only have equal pay for our work but affordable childcare where were respected in the world working with our allies to defeat terrorism and stop the spread of nuclear weapons, 2847, 2883
So yes change is coming The choice is yours about what kind of change well have.n "And I hope you will choose to be part of this campaign because its not just about winning on November 8th as important as that is, 2883, 2925
It is about getting to work because I do believe we are stronger together.n" Tim Kaine and I wrote a book laying out our agenda because I think you deserve to know what I will try to do as your president, 2925, 2966
So if you will help we will come together to give every American the chance to chart your own future and contribute to our great country.n "Lets prove once and for all that love trumps hate.n" Thank you, 2966, 3004
