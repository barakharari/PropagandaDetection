 Thank you for joining us Madam Secretary, 0, 7
  Lets talk about that "Des Moines Register" — that "Des Moines Register" poll that has you in the lead — eight years ago your hopes were dashed by that surge of new voters for Barack Obama, 7, 43
Are you confident that wont happen again? " Well George heres what Im confident about, 43, 58
Weve run a terrific campaign from the grassroots up, 58, 67
I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign, 67, 83
And were going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night, 83, 103
Of course its close, 103, 107
Its competitive, 107, 109
Thats why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night." " You did have that surprise on Friday; the State Department saying they will not release 22 emails of yours deemed top secret, 109, 153
You want them released, 153, 157
Why are you so confident that release would not compromise national security? What do you know about those emails that we dont?" " Well heres what I know, 157, 185
I know that this is I think a continuation of the story that has been playing out for months, 185, 204
There is no classified marked information on those emails sent or received by me, 204, 218
Dianne Feinstein the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee whos had a chance to review them has said that this email chain did not originate with me and that there were no classification markings, 218, 252
So I do want them released and of course I cant be clear about exactly what the reasons might be for some in the government as part of this interagency dispute to make this request not to make them public, 252, 292
But I would like to see them disclosed and I think they can, 292, 305
It should be disclosed —"    Your supporters — " — that Im told about them." " — your supporters including Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack former governor of Iowa and Senator Feinstein herself has suggested its political, 305, 341
Is that what you think?" " Well its — Im going to leave that to others who are quite experienced in the ways of Washington to comment on, 341, 369
I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning, 369, 391
And I just want this matter resolved, 391, 398
The best way to resolve is to do what I asked months ago release these let the public see them and lets move on." " You know youve said many times that the emails were not marked classified, 398, 436
No evidence that thats not true, 436, 442
But the non-disclosure agreement you signed as secretary of state said that that really is not that relevant, 442, 460
It says classified information is marked or unmarked classified and that all of your training to treat all of that sensitively and should know the difference." " Well of course, 460, 490
And thats exactly what I did, 490, 496
I take classified information very seriously, 496, 502
You know you cant get information off the classified system in the State Department to put onto an unclassified system no matter what that system is, 502, 528
We were very specific about that and you — when you receive information of course there has to be some markings some indication that someone down the chain had thought that this was classified and that was not the case, 528, 568
The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what Im told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report, 568, 607
That seems a little hard to understand that we would be retroactively over classifying a public newspaper article, 607, 625
So lets just get it out, 625, 631
Lets see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions, 631, 645
This is very much like Benghazi George, 645, 652
You know the Republicans are going to continue to use it beat up on me, 652, 667
I understand that, 667, 670
Thats the way they are, 670, 675
But after 11 hours of testimony answering every single question in public which I have requested for many months I think its pretty clear theyre grasping at straws and this will turn out —"    Finally on this matter you know a few months back you told my colleague David Mir it was a mistake to set up this private server, 675, 735
Yet just this Monday you said there was no error in judgment, 735, 747
How do you square those two statements? " Well look as Ive said many times it was permitted, 747, 765
My predecessors had engaged in a similar practice, 765, 773
It was not the best choice, 773, 779
I wouldnt be here talking to you about it, 779, 788
Id be talking about what people in Iowa are talking to me about about affordable health care and jobs and rising wages and all of the concerns that are on their minds, 788, 820
And be you know really able to answer their questions as I have been now for so many months."  You and Senator Sanders really going at it right now, 820, 849
And here was — he was on the stump there yesterday saying this about your attack, 849, 865
  " Dont tell me that Im defending or protecting the gun lobby, 865, 877
Dont tell me Im attacking Planned Parenthood, 877, 884
Those are inaccuracies, 884, 887
And we can do better than that."   " Hes calling you on this says he got a D- rating from the NRA and 100 percent record with Planned Parenthood." " Well let me tell you what the people who work on these issues every day have said, 887, 934
They say Im the leader, 934, 939
Im the leader who has taken on tough issues, 939, 948
Ive taken on difficult issues like Planned Parenthood the gun lobby for many years, 948, 962
And they concluded to endorse me by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, 962, 974
I was very honored to have that, 974, 981
Thats not saying that others havent voted with them, 981, 990
But they were looking for a leader and they found it with me, 990, 1003
Ive been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames Iowa endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly because they believe Im the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby the same with the Human Rights Campaign, 1003, 1052
They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community, 1052, 1071
Now that is just the facts, 1071, 1077
People who have known us people who have evaluated us people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me, 1077, 1102
And Im very proud of that."  You know you just mentioned  " hitting you with the email issue, 1102, 1120
Theyre clearly going to hit Bernie Sanders with the fact that hes a Democratic socialist if he gets the nomination, 1120, 1140
Some of your supporters concerned about that Senator Claire McCaskill are saying they cant wait to run an ad with a hammer and a sickle, 1140, 1165
Steny Hoyer Congressman Steny Hoyer saying he calls himself a socialist, 1165, 1176
I dont think thats a good title to be running for President of the United States, 1176, 1192
Is that what you think? Will the fact that hes a Democratic socialist make it harder for Democrats to win in November?" " Well that certainly is what a lot of Democratic leaders are saying, 1192, 1227
And I take them at their word, 1227, 1234
They know their states, 1234, 1238
They know the country, 1238, 1242
They know we have to take back the Senate, 1242, 1251
They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country, 1251, 1271
Heres what I think, 1271, 1275
I think Ive been subjected as you know so well to years of scrutiny and Im still standing talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that, 1275, 1310
And its a very tough gantlet to run, 1310, 1318
And if there are issues that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic theyre going to use it, 1318, 1345
I feel vetted, 1345, 1348
I feel ready, 1348, 1351
I feel strong and I think Im the best person to be the nominee and to defeat whoever they nominate in November." " Finally I wonder what your response to this quote from your old friend Robert Rice Secretary of Labor under President Clinton, 1351, 1395
He said youre the most qualified candidate for the political system we now have, 1395, 1409
But Bernie Sanders is the most qualified candidate to create the political system we should have, 1409, 1425
How do you respond to that?" " Well look Im a progressive who thinks its important to actually make progress, 1425, 1445
Thats what Ive done my entire life, 1445, 1452
Thats what I will do as president, 1452, 1459
Obviously I have big goals, 1459, 1464
I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top, 1464, 1486
Get incomes rising get women equal pay raise the minimum wage have a renaissance in manufacturing move toward clean renewable energy — I have big goals, 1486, 1512
And I tell you how Im going to get there and how Im going to pay for them, 1512, 1530
And I think that is what the Americans want, 1530, 1539
Im not going to sit here and overpromise and under-deliver, 1539, 1549
Im going to tell you what I know we can achieve and thats going to take the political system we have right now and then I intend to bring in more people as always have George, 1549, 1585
When I ran for Senate the first time you remember you know people didnt give me much of a chance, 1585, 1605
I won and then when I was reelected I won with a bigger percentage, 1605, 1619
And then when I was Secretary of State even the Republicans said I was doing a good job, 1619, 1637
So I understand politics, 1637, 1641
I understand a campaign, 1641, 1645
I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel theyve been left out and left behind, 1645, 1673
I think I know how to do that and I think the voters know that I know how to do that."  Secretary Clinton thanks for joining us this morning, 1673, 1702
 Great to talk to you George, 1702, 1708
Thank you, 1708, 1710
 And we will be right back with Bernie Sanders, 1710, 1719
