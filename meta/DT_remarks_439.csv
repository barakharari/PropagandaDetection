"It is so great to be back in Florida my second home, 0, 12
Let me also thank our good and dear friend Chairman Jeff Miller for joining us here today, 12, 29
Weve worked closely together on developing much-needed reforms to take care of our Veterans." Let me open by making this very important declaration: I love this state I love the people of this state and together we are going to have an amazing victory in November, 29, 75
Decades of political failure and corruption will come swiftly to an end and a New American Future will begin, 75, 94
The citizens of this country will be in charge once more, 94, 105
The special interests have had their day, 105, 112
That chapter in our history is closing, 112, 119
The history book is closing on the failed politicians of yesterday, 119, 130
A new chapter is beginning and this chapter will be authored by you the American people, 130, 146
This will be your time, 146, 151
You will be running the show, 151, 157
Not the donors not the insiders not the media executives, 157, 167
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 167, 180
All we have to do is cut our ties to the bitter failures of the past and anything becomes possible, 180, 200
Change is coming, 200, 203
"All the people whove rigged the system for their own personal benefit are trying to stop our change campaign because they know that their gravy train has reached its last stop." "Its your turn now, 203, 238
This is your time." The fact that so many encrusted old political insiders oppose our campaign is the best proof you will ever need that we are fighting for real change – not partisan change, 238, 273
"We are fighting for all Americans – Democrats Republicans Independents Conservatives Liberals – whove been failed by this corrupt system, 273, 293
Were fighting for everyone who doesnt have a voice." "Were also fighting for every region of this country, 293, 311
For every part of Florida and every part of America, 311, 321
From Pensacola to Pittsburgh from Baltimore to Baton Rouge we are fighting for every last city and every last person in this country." Hillary Clinton is the candidate of the past, 321, 352
Ours is the campaign of the future, 352, 359
In this future we are going to pursue new trade policies that put American workers first – and that keep jobs in our country, 359, 383
All the people who got NAFTA wrong and China wrong and who are trying to give us the Trans-Pacific Partnership – are the same failed voices pushing for Hillary Clinton, 383, 413
"Our trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars, 413, 425
Weve lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since Bill and Hillary Clinton gave us NAFTA, 425, 440
China is manipulating its currency and taking our jobs, 440, 449
We are going to stop companies from leaving our country and keep those jobs right here in America, 449, 467
The era of economic surrender is over." "We will also have a very strong border that stops people and drugs from illegally pouring into our country -- and were going to build a border wall and Mexico will pay for it." In this new future we are going to raise your wages, 467, 519
Household incomes are over $4000 less today than they were in the year 2000, 519, 533
"My tax trade energy immigration and regulation reforms will get your salaries and wages up, 533, 548
Hillary Clinton will continue the failed economic agenda that has only made her friends rich at your personal expense, 548, 567
Many people in this room tonight and across this country havent seen a real wage increase in 18 years." The people getting rich off of our rigged system have sent tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton – much of it to her personal bank account – to keep you from having the future you deserve, 567, 624
But on November 8th you get to vote for the future you want, 624, 637
In this future we are going to pursue new education policies, 637, 648
At the center of my plan is school choice, 648, 657
I want every disadvantaged child in America to be able to attend the public or private school that is right for them and their family, 657, 682
"In this future we are also going to keep our country out of the endless wars that have defined Hillary Clintons career." To keep our country out of war we will remember those three very famous words: Peace Through Strength, 682, 722
That means rebuilding our badly depleted military, 722, 729
I laid out a detailed plan this week to re-invest in our military and our troops, 729, 745
We are going to build a 350 ship Navy a 540000 soldier Army an Air Force of 1200 combat-ready fighter jets and a Marine Core built on 36 Battalions, 745, 774
Crucially we are also going to pursue a state-of-the-art missile defense, 774, 785
We will start by modernizing our cruisers to provide the Ballistic Missile Defense capability our nation needs, 785, 802
As we expand our Navy toward the goal of 350 ships we will also procure additional modern destroyers that are designed to handle the missile defense mission in the coming years, 802, 833
Just today we were reminded of the need for missile defense after North Korea performed its fourth nuclear test since Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, 833, 859
One more massive Hillary Clinton failure, 859, 865
Just like she failed in Iran and put them on the path to nuclear weapons, 865, 880
Hillary Clinton has presided over the greatest series of foreign policy failures and blunders anyone has ever seen, 880, 898
Her policies have produced massive global disorder, 898, 905
She handed Iraq over to ISIS unleashing that terror group onto the world, 905, 918
ISIS would not be threatening the West today if not for the decisions Hillary Clinton made, 918, 934
She helped destabilize Egypt by supporting the ouster of President Mubarak in exchange for the Muslim Brotherhood, 934, 951
Fortunately President El-Sisi is now in charge but terrorists have gained a foothold in that country, 951, 967
She helped push Syria into a prolonged civil war by pushing regime change in that country too – without any plan for the day after, 967, 992
She failed with China which has only grown more aggressive, 992, 1002
By the way she also let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property, 1002, 1019
And of course Hillary Clinton failed with her Russian Reset, 1019, 1029
She gave up missile defense in Poland and the Czech Republic in exchange for nothing in return, 1029, 1046
Then she gave up 20% of U.S, 1046, 1053
uranium to Russia –while those who benefited from the deal gave money to the Clintons, 1053, 1068
"Lets not forget Russia went into Crimea on President Obamas watch." Unlike Clinton and Obama we will negotiate with Russia from a position of strength – not weakness, 1068, 1096
And weakness is all we get from President Obama and Hillary Clinton, 1096, 1108
The difference between me and my opponent on Vladimir Putin and in all negotiations is that I negotiate by creating leverage so I can extract a good deal for the United States, 1108, 1140
Hillary Clinton negotiates but never gets anything of value for the United States, 1140, 1153
Putin laughs at our leaders and takes them to the cleaners again and again, 1153, 1167
That is why we will rebuild our military strengthen our economy and regain our position of leadership in the world – so we can negotiate from a position of great strength once again, 1167, 1200
If I cannot get a good deal for the United States I will follow the example of Ronald Reagan and walk away, 1200, 1222
That is completely contrary to the way President Obama and Hillary Clinton negotiate which gets nothing of value for the United States ever, 1222, 1245
They just keep losing, 1245, 1249
I will end this legacy of failure and strongly defend the interests of the United States, 1249, 1265
"But I will also keep focused on the ultimate goal, 1265, 1275
We will not seek endless conflict and hostility; we wont get trapped in the failed approaches of the past, 1275, 1294
A future where America can find common ground with countries like Russia and China is a better future for our children." We will pursue these relationships with our eyes wide open and a clear understanding of our many many differences, 1294, 1334
I will advocate the American position with a strength and clarity President Obama and Hillary Clinton never have, 1334, 1352
No more apology tours, 1352, 1356
No more bowing to foreign powers, 1356, 1362
We proudly defend America at every single turn, 1362, 1370
America will get the respect it deserves, 1370, 1377
"And if we dont I will walk away from the deal like youve never seen anyone walk before, 1377, 1395
And believe me within a short while they will come back -- but only on my terms therefore the terms of the American people." "On these principles we will pursue our long-term goals of peace – for the sake of our kids and for the sake of the worlds future." Hillary Clinton has failed in every single country where she has ever gotten involved and at a very high price for the world, 1395, 1468
"Her policies have produced only death and destruction not diplomacy, 1468, 1478
Shes trigger-happy pushing recklessly for regime change – but never creating or promoting stability or advancing the core interests of the United States." Her only real achievement as Secretary of State has been getting away with her massive email scandal, 1478, 1518
She bleached deleted and destroyed her emails after a subpoena from Congress, 1518, 1530
She lied to Congress while under oath and smashed her phones with a hammer to keep them from getting to authorities, 1530, 1551
By the way who has thirteen phones in the first place? Only somebody with a whole lot to hide, 1551, 1570
And we all know what Hillary Clinton was hiding, 1570, 1579
She was hiding her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State, 1579, 1589
"Hillary Clinton isnt just part of the corrupt establishment she is the corrupt establishment." "I just saw her press conference today where Hillary Clinton complained about all of the problems in the world, 1589, 1622
If only wed had a competent Secretary of State who could have prevented all of these problems from happening." Throughout it all Hillary Clinton and her Foundation raked in millions and millions of dollars from the most oppressive and brutal regimes on earth, 1622, 1665
Hillary Clinton and her Foundation have cozied up to regimes that oppress and brutalize women that murder gays and that violate human rights on an unimaginable scale, 1665, 1692
My Administration will be a voice for all people who are oppressed including the millions of women being oppressed by Radical Islam, 1692, 1714
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and produced only failure, 1714, 1726
Yet people keep giving her money and protecting her, 1726, 1735
"Its the powerful protecting the powerful." The insiders fighting for insiders, 1735, 1746
I am fighting for you, 1746, 1751
All the people advising Hillary Clinton are the people responsible for the endless wars and conflicts and the tragedies in the Middle East, 1751, 1774
I am proud to have the support of the retired generals and admirals who know how to win – and how to avoid endless war, 1774, 1799
Let me also take this moment to express our deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has worn the uniform but most especially to those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for this country, 1799, 1833
There is no greater expression of love than the love shown by the men and women who have laid down their lives for their country and its people, 1833, 1861
"It is our duty to ensure that their sacrifices are not in vain, 1861, 1874
That means we dont issue timetables for political reasons but that we work with our generals and our leaders to produce a real plan for victory." We will pursue a new steady foreign policy that seeks to advance the national security interests of the United States – not a reckless interventionist globalism that has failed this country so badly, 1874, 1933
And we will be clear in naming our enemy: Radical Islamic Terrorism, 1933, 1945
"The fact that Hillary Clinton cant even say these words proves how unfit she is to lead this country, 1945, 1964
This is one single fact she can never escape." Any country that shares our goal of defeating this enemy will be our partner in this mission, 1964, 1990
We will break the cycle of regime change and refugee crisis that has gone on for so many years, 1990, 2009
"We simply cant afford to continue down the road we are on right now." That applies to everything, 2009, 2027
Change is needed at every single level of our society, 2027, 2037
"When I talk about making America Great Again Im talking about creating a future that includes each and every American." I want the most inclusive generous and prosperous society we have ever had, 2037, 2070
The possibilities for our future are unlimited, 2070, 2077
The Hillary Clinton campaign is so small so petty so tired, 2077, 2088
If we just break from this bitter divisive past we can achieve anything, 2088, 2101
"That also means breaking from the lies and the deceit of the Clintons, 2101, 2114
They want to scare you out of voting for change, 2114, 2124
The most recent smear comes from Bill Clinton who said that the theme of Make America Great Again is somehow racist – now theyve unearthed video footage of Bill Clinton repeatedly using this same phrase, 2124, 2159
Its just one more Clinton lie one more desperate slander to keep the people from having the future they deserve." "When I talk about Making America Great Again Im talking about making it Great Again for Everyone – but especially for all of the Americans who have been left behind." We are the campaign of unity and we will deliver amazing things for all of our people, 2159, 2226
New schools new factories new infrastructure, 2226, 2232
Beautiful skyscrapers will rise all across this nation, 2232, 2240
We will develop Detroit Not Beijing, 2240, 2246
Most importantly we will fight to end the systemic poverty in our inner cities and to lift millions of African-Americans and Hispanics out of poverty, 2246, 2271
Here in Florida we have such an amazing and diverse community of Hispanic-Americans – from Cuba from Puerto Rico from Venezuela from Haiti from all over, 2271, 2297
These incredible Americans will have in Donald J, 2297, 2305
Trump a President who is determined to fight for their jobs their wages their schools and their futures, 2305, 2323
To all Hispanic-Americans who want better jobs and higher wages: I will be your champion, 2323, 2338
All working people of all backgrounds and from all places will have a true friend in Donald Trump, 2338, 2356
In particular I have a very special place in my heart for those who make a living as tradesmen craftsmen and construction workers, 2356, 2379
"Ive spent my professional life among construction workers bricklayers electricians and plumbers, 2379, 2391
I feel more comfortable around blue collar workers than Wall Street executives, 2391, 2403
Theres a reason the hedge fund managers are funding Hillary Clintons campaign and not mine." My campaign is powered by my own money but also small dollar donations from people like all of you who just want their country back, 2403, 2443
"This is our chance, 2443, 2447
Its our last chance to give the people control over their own futures once again." Gleaming new plants stretching across our nation, 2447, 2469
Young Latino children getting an amazing education at the school of their choice – and their parents having their jobs protected from unfair competition, 2469, 2493
Our Veterans will get the best healthcare in the world, 2493, 2503
You can read the whole plan on our website DonaldJTrump.com, 2503, 2513
Massive tax reductions and tax simplification – so that you can keep more of your precious time and your hard-earned money, 2513, 2534
Hillary Clinton wants to raise your taxes big time, 2534, 2543
Most importantly 2017 will be about unity, 2543, 2550
Once again we will be One American Nation, 2550, 2558
We Will Be One American People, 2558, 2564
Just imagine what we can accomplish together if we set aside our differences and focus on what we have in common as Americans, 2564, 2587
We will be one people living under One God saluting one beautiful American Flag, 2587, 2601
We Will Make America Proud Again, 2601, 2607
We Will Make America Prosperous Again, 2607, 2613
We Will Make America Safe Again, 2613, 2619
Friends and fellow citizens We Will Make America Great Again! , 2619, 2629
