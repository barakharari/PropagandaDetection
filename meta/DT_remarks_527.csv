Real change also means getting rid of the corruption in Washington, 0, 11
As you have heard it was just announced yesterday that the FBI is reopening their investigation into the criminal and illegal conduct of Hillary Clinton, 11, 36
"This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate and it is everybodys deepest hope that justice at last can be delivered." Hillary has nobody but herself to blame for her mounting legal troubles, 36, 69
Her criminal action was willful deliberate intentional and purposeful, 69, 78
Hillary set-up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure, 78, 95
She set-up this illegal server knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk and put the safety and security of your children at risk, 95, 123
To further cover-up her crimes she bleached and deleted 33000 emails after a Congressional Subpoena made 13 phones disappear – some with a hammer lied to Congress under oath lied to the FBI and then two boxes of email evidence went mysteriously missing, 123, 166
She even pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified, 166, 182
"As the recent release of a memo from one of Bill Clintons closest associates demonstrates the Clintons have turned the government into a scheme for personal profit." The Clintons even saw the deadly disaster in Haiti as an opportunity to cash-in, 182, 223
"The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing weve ever seen before – including a candidate who boasts to donors about having a public position for the voters and a private position for Wall Street." "Hillary put the office of Secretary of State up for sale and if she ever got the chance shed put the Oval Office up for sale too." Hillary should have been convicted long ago, 223, 302
That the legal process has been taking this long is incredible, 302, 313
"And now its reported that the Department of Justice is fighting the FBI – thats because the Department of Justice is trying to protect her." "97% of Department of Justice employees presidential contributions went to Hillary Clinton." There are those and I happen to be one of them who think Hillary offered Lorretta Lynch a reappointment as Attorney General, 313, 372
Perhaps that was what Bill Clinton was doing in the secret meeting on the tarmac in Arizona, 372, 389
He said it was to play golf but he never played and it was over 100 degrees, 389, 406
This is what we mean when we call it a rigged system, 406, 418
Now the Attorney General is fighting the FBI for doing what was right – but what should have been done many months ago, 418, 441
Perhaps through this other investigation they found what may be some of the 33000 missing and deleted emails Hillary tried desperately to destroy even going so far as to use digital bleach, 441, 473
The stakes on November 8th could not be higher, 473, 482
A vote for Hillary is vote a to surrender our government to public corruption graft and cronyism that threatens the very foundations of our Constitutional system, 482, 508
"What makes us exceptional is that we are a nation of laws and that we are all equal under those laws – Hillarys corruption shreds that foundational principle." Public Corruption is a grave and profound threat to a Democracy, 508, 547
Government corruption spreads outward like a cancer and infects the operations of government itself, 547, 561
If the corruption is not removed then the people are not able to have faith in their government, 561, 579
It deadens and saps the spirit of civic participation, 579, 588
Corruption decays our trust in institutions and our legal system, 588, 598
When the outcome is fixed when the system is rigged people lose hope, 598, 611
They detach, 611, 613
Our society becomes unplugged and unhinged, 613, 619
When the powerful can get away with anything because they have the money and the connections to rig the system then the laws lose their moral authority, 619, 646
Hillary believes money and power – not truth and justice – should rule the day, 646, 661
As FDR once said government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob, 661, 678
This is what we often see in Third World countries – where the governments are often run by a small handful of corrupt people for their personal enrichment, 678, 706
Corruption is corrosive to every institution of government and it must be stopped, 706, 719
Restoring honesty to our government and the rule of law to our society will be my highest priority as President, 719, 739
We must save the America, 739, 744
That is why My Contract With The American Voter begins with a plan to end government corruption and take our country back from the special interests, 744, 770
I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words I am about to say, 770, 789
When we win on November 8th We Are Going To Washington D.C, 789, 801
And We Are Going To DRAIN THE SWAMP, 801, 809
