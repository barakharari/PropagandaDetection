"Hello! Hello CHCI! It is so great to be back here with so many friends and to see so many young people here because that fits the theme this year: educate engage vote, 0, 33
And I cant think of better marching orders for the next 54 days, 33, 46
Cheers, 46, 47
And anyone who just heard the congresswoman knows we cannot be on the sidelines, 47, 61
This is the most consequential election in our lifetimes, 61, 70
"I want to recognize the Institute for all you do to inspire the next generation of Latino leaders, 70, 88
Last year I had the chance to spend time with some of the CHCI interns and fellows, 88, 105
It really was like seeing the future of America in one room, 105, 117
I cant wait to see everything that they achieve, 117, 126
And I cant wait if Im fortunate enough to be president to put some of them to work!" "And I want to thank all my friends in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, 126, 157
You fight every single day to lift up the Latino community – when the cameras are rolling and when the cameras are off at home in your districts and here in Washington, 157, 189
And no one understands better than you the pivotal moment were at right now – not just for Latinos but for our country." "My friends in the caucus have traveled to every battleground state registered voters, 189, 225
Youve stayed focused no matter what kind of outlandish and offensive comments we have heard from my opponent and his supporters, 225, 246
By the way I personally think a taco truck on every corner sounds absolutely delicious." "Now heres a confession: Running for president is never easy but it shouldnt be right? But tonight I have the ultimate challenge: speaking after President Obama, 246, 287
Hes always a tough act to follow in more ways than one." "I for one dont think the President gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from another Great Depression, 287, 319
Think of what weve achieved these last eight years, 319, 328
American businesses have created 15 million new jobs since the recession, 328, 339
Twenty million Americans have health coverage – and no one has seen a bigger drop in uninsured rates under the Affordable Care Act than Latino Americans, 339, 365
We got more good news this week, 365, 372
A report came out showing that poverty is going down and incomes for American families are going up and Latino families have seen the biggest increase of all." "Now that doesnt mean we rest on our laurels by any stretch, 372, 412
Our work is far from finished, 412, 418
But I am more confident than ever that our best days are still ahead of us, 418, 434
I believe with all my heart that the American Dream is alive and its big enough for everyone to share its promise, 434, 456
That doesnt mean that lots of people are still not hurting because I know they are, 456, 472
And when you hear a presidential candidate spewing bigotry and hate its easy to get discouraged, 472, 488
But were here because we know this election is a choice between not just two people but two very different visions for our Americas future." "Either were going to make our economy work for everyone or just those at the top." "Either were going to fear our differences or embrace and celebrate our diversity." "Either were going to pit Americans against each other and deepen the divides or were going to be stronger together." "Today as you know were in the midst of Hispanic Heritage Month, 488, 574
In classrooms across America children will study Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez Julián and Joaquín Castro Justice Sotomayor Roberto Clemente and Laurie Hernandez Gloria Estefan and Lin-Manuel Miranda and countless others – names we know and names we might not know but every one of whom has enriched this country for generations." "Whether youre Mexican Puerto Rican Cuban Latin American Afro-Latino whether your family just arrived or has been here since before the United States even existed cheers youre not strangers, 574, 655
Youre not intruders, 655, 658
Youre our neighbors our col-leagues our friends our families, 658, 667
You make our nation stronger smarter more creative, 667, 675
And I want you to know that I see you and I am with you and time and again – time and again we have seen that when we invest in the community when we make it possible for Latinos to get the health care you need get the education you desire compete for jobs start new businesses pursue your dreams all of America benefits." "As I said this afternoon in North Carolina we are in the final stretch of this election, 675, 757
And I intend to close my campaign the way I began my career fighting for kids and families, 757, 775
Thats been the cause of my life, 775, 782
It will be the passion of my presidency, 782, 790
So tonight I want to mention two things Ill do in the first 100 days of my administration to help families in every corner of America." "First we do need to create an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top, 790, 834
Theres something wrong when Latinos are 17 percent of our countrys population but hold only 2 percent of its wealth, 834, 854
Weve got to work together to connect more Latinos with good jobs that pay good wages with more opportunities to get the skills they need to go to college to launch new ventures to build wealth that can be passed on to your kids and your grandkids, 854, 901
So were going to make in my first 100 days the biggest investment in new good-paying jobs since World War II jobs in infrastructure manufacturing technology innovative clean energy." "And were going to cut red tape and taxes and expand access to capital for small busi-nesses including the Latino-owned small businesses that create so many jobs and so much growth in communities everywhere, 901, 964
And I want to give a particular shout-out to Latina small business owners, 964, 977
Not everyone knows this but you are among the fastest-growing group of entrepreneurs in America, 977, 992
And were going to put families first with new solutions that reflect the way people live and work today, 992, 1011
Supporting families with paid family leave earned sick days and affordable childcare isnt a luxury its a necessity, 1011, 1029
When families are strong America is strong." "And that brings me to another important family issue, 1029, 1045
In those first 100 days I will send a proposal for comprehensive immigration reform to the Congress, 1045, 1062
My proposal will keep families together and it will include a path to citizenship, 1062, 1076
Now I know this isnt the first time youve heard it, 1076, 1087
In fact people have been making the same promise for more than a decade, 1087, 1101
But I believe with all my heart that some things are too important to give up on, 1101, 1118
Ive been called a lot of things; Ive never been called a quitter." "And in this election – in this election we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isnt just the smart thing to do its what the American people demand, 1118, 1162
And you know how well show that? Well I hope to have a Democratic Congress next January, 1162, 1179
Cheers, 1179, 1180
But no matter what on my first day in office I will reach out to Republicans and say this is your chance to help millions of families and show that your party the party of Lincoln is better than Donald Trump." "And while were fighting for comprehensive immigration reform were going to keep families together, 1180, 1235
When the deadlocked Supreme Court put DAPA and expanded DACA on hold for 5 million immigrants it was devastating to millions of families, 1235, 1258
But the court didnt actually rule on the substance of the case, 1258, 1270
And as Ive said repeatedly I believe DAPA and expanded DACA are squarely within the Presidents authority and will I protect them and keep fighting for them." "But in addition to defending DAPA and DACA theres more we can do, 1270, 1310
We need a simple straightforward system where other people with sympathetic cases who are contributing to their communities can make their case and be eligible for deferred action too, 1310, 1339
Like people who experience and report extreme labor abuses, 1339, 1348
And we wont stop there, 1348, 1353
Were going to end family detention close private detention facilities and stop the raids and roundups, 1353, 1369
No child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if their mom or dad will be there when they get home." "So heres the bottom line, 1369, 1400
Comprehensive immigration reform will not only be the right thing to do but it will add $700 billion to our economy and enable America to be what its always been – a place where people from around the world can come to reunite with family start new businesses pursue their dreams apply their talents to American growth and innovation." "Now I know this has been a long road and we wouldnt be where we are today without your persistence and the quiet courage of families in every state of our union and we certainly wouldnt be here without the bravery of the young men and women who have risked their very place in the United States by coming forward and fighting for their own future and the future of millions of others, 1400, 1532
They helped change the conversation, 1532, 1537
And when President Obama created DACA it changed their lives." "Right now 750000 undocumented young people in America are going to school working and planning for their future, 1537, 1565
Theyre DREAMers in much more than name, 1565, 1572
Ive met so many, 1572, 1576
Ive listened to their stories, 1576, 1581
Theyve done everything weve asked of them and made our country stronger in return." So when Donald Trump promises to rip that all away on Day One when he promises to round up and deport all of the 16 million people living and working among us including American citizen children who were born here to parents who are undocumented these are the faces I see, 1581, 1646
"I picture Astrid Silva – who I met in Las Vegas, 1646, 1657
Many of you know her story: She came to this country from Mexico at the age of four with nothing but a doll a cross and the dress she was wearing, 1657, 1688
Now shes in her 20s advocating for the rights of everywhere." I picture a young man I never met whose high school teacher wrote me a few months ago to share his story, 1688, 1721
His teacher told me that his former student was funny enthusiastic and patriotic, 1721, 1734
He played the drums in the school marching band and after graduation in 2005 proudly enlisted in the U.S, 1734, 1753
Army, 1753, 1754
Before shipping off to Iraq he stopped by the school so everyone could see him in his new uniform, 1754, 1773
"He was his teacher wrote as respectful and optimistic as any student who ever entered my classroom, 1773, 1790
He was also a DREAMer brought here as an undocumented child, 1790, 1801
He loved America and hoped one day to earn his citizenship, 1801, 1812
But in April 2007 while on a mission in Baghdad he was killed by an improvised explosive device, 1812, 1830
He was just 19, 1830, 1834
The Army called him a hero and he was posthumously granted the American citizenship hed always wanted." All these years later – his teacher still treasures his memory, 1834, 1862
And this teacher wanted me to know – he wanted me to know that despite what Donald Trump may say immigrants are not rapists and criminals, 1862, 1888
The truth is this young man may not have been born here but he represented the best values of our country, 1888, 1909
"We teach our children that America is one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all, 1909, 1927
Not just for people who look a certain way or worship a certain way but for all, 1927, 1944
Everywhere I go people tell me how concerned they are by the extreme policies and divisive rhetoric theyve heard from my opponent – from the racist lie about Mexican immigrants that launched his presidential campaign to his racist attacks on a federal judge." "And every time we think hes hit rock bottom he sinks even lower, 1944, 2000
His latest target? A minister in Flint Michigan who respectfully asked him not to use her pulpit for political attacks, 2000, 2020
He called her a nervous mess." "How insulting how dead wrong, 2020, 2031
Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess – shes a rock for her community in trying times and she deserves better and so does America, 2031, 2058
And again today he did it again, 2058, 2065
He was asked one more time Where was President Obama born? And he still wouldnt still say Hawaii, 2065, 2083
He still wouldnt say America, 2083, 2088
This man wants to be our next president? When will he stop this ugliness this bigotry?" "Now hes tried to reset himself and his campaign many times, 2088, 2115
This is the best he can do, 2115, 2122
This is who he is, 2122, 2127
And so we need to decide who we are, 2127, 2136
If we just sigh and shake our heads and accept this then what does that tell our kids about who we are? We need to stand up and repudiate this divisive rhetoric, 2136, 2168
We need to stop him conclusively in November in an election that sends a message that even he can hear, 2168, 2188
We need to set the kind of example we want for ourselves and our children and our grandchildren" "Parents and teachers are already worried about what theyre calling the Trump Effect, 2188, 2219
Bullying and harassment are on the rise in our schools especially targeting students of color Muslims and immigrants." "At a high school basket game in Indiana white students held up Trump signs and taunted Latino players on the opposing team with chants of Build the wall and Speak English." "Donald Trump is running the most divisive campaigns of our lifetimes, 2219, 2279
His message is you should be afraid – afraid of people whose race or ethnicity is different or whose religious faith is different or who were born in a different country, 2279, 2310
Theres no innuendo or dog whistles anymore, 2310, 2317
Its all right out there in the open now, 2317, 2326
So weve got to come back twice as strong and twice as clear." "Just this week a mother in Florida wrote to me about her 11-year-old son Francisco, 2326, 2354
Hes proud to be American Colombian Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican, 2354, 2364
As he calls it a potluck of Hispanic heritage, 2364, 2373
And Francisco has been following this election very closely his mother told me, 2373, 2386
He wears his Love Trumps Hate pin every day and refuses to take it off, 2386, 2401
When his father warned him that might make him a target for bullies Francisco looked his father in the eye and he said: I was always told to stand up for myself and what I believe in, 2401, 2438
And I believe Trump is wrong, 2438, 2444
And good for you Francisco." "Thats what we have to do in this election and thats what so many of you are doing already: standing up to the bullying and bigotry wherever it comes from." Together we must send this resounding message and we need to inspire a level of turnout that will help us win up and down the ticket, 2444, 2505
"Weve set an ambitious goal of registering and committing 3 million people to vote in this election that would not have otherwise voted and we cant do it without you, 2505, 2535
Nearly half of Latinos in America are under 35 and we need you to show up and make your voices heard in this election." "So were going to keep asking for your help, 2535, 2568
Keep hitting the campaign trail, 2568, 2573
Please talk to your friends your neighbors your community – everyone you see between now and November 8th, 2573, 2591
Tell them to go to hillaryclinton.com or text JOIN J-O-I-N to 47246 to get involved, 2591, 2606
This election is too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines as we heard from Congresswoman Sanchez." "So lets stand up for a future where we put families first, 2606, 2636
Where we build bridges not walls." And yes together we can prove love trumps hate, 2636, 2651
Thank you all very much." , 2651, 2656
