"I will work harder than anyone to actually make the changes that make your lives better." Hillary fought for every vote in the New Hampshire primary, 0, 26
And when she came up short she took the stage to address the thousands of people who worked so hard for her in the Granite State, 26, 52
And Hillary made an important pledge: She talked about the many things that she and Senator Sanders agree on—like the need to overturn Citizens United and guarantee that Wall Street can never be allowed to once again threaten Main Street, 52, 92
But she also talked about the choice voters have in this election, 92, 104
She vowed to "break through the barriers of bigotry" and make sure that nothing is holding Americans back, 104, 122
And she reminded the audience that this is not a new fight for her, 122, 136
She thanked everyone who is helping to make this campaign what it is—and build a better tomorrow for all our children and grandchildren, 136, 159
