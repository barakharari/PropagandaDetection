As I mentioned yesterday on of the—and you probably saw this and maybe some of you have just read it.one of the top Department of Justice officials involved in the e-mail investigation Assistant Attorney General Peter Kassig " n is a close associate of John Podesta, 136, 182
The two met for dinner after Clinton testified about Benghazi and Podesta who by the way said Hillary Clinton has terrible instincts on WikiLeaks described him as the man who kept him Podesta out of jail.n Kadzik is also the one who helped lead the effort to confirm Attorney General Loretta Lynch, 182, 234
Now today in a newly released e- mail—through WikiLeaks again—we learned that Kadzik was feeding information about the investigation into the Clinton campaign and that  n right? And that Kadzik said quote "It will be a while before the State Department posts the e-mails." Remember they were waiting for the e-mails, 234, 285
 n "Podesta forwarded the e-mails to Clintons top staff and said additional chances for mischief, 285, 300
These are the people that want to run our country folks, 300, 311
" n "The spread of political agendas into the Justice Department—theres never been a thing like this that has happened in our countrys history—is one of the saddest things that has happened to our country, 311, 346

So show up early and vote, 361, 367
Show up early, 367, 370
You know the lines are incredible, 370, 376

Real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing Obamacare, 464, 473

I want you to think about the future after we take back the White House so Im not going to tell you what your hike is but let me just say its going to be very substantial, 542, 579
And Obamacare doesnt work on top of everything else, 579, 588
As an example in the great state of Arizona—which I just left—premiums are going up more than 116 percent, 588, 607
Its out of control.n" "Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurance next year, 607, 625
Lots of luck in your negotiation, 625, 631
In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent the Democratic governor said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable, 631, 655
Premiums are surging companies are leaving insurers are fleeing doctors are quitting and deductibles are absolutely through the roof, 655, 674
Wasnt supposed to be like this but I said it was going to be like this before it was passed because I understand how business works.n" "Obamacare never had a chance, 674, 705
Its a catastrophe, 705, 708
Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive, 708, 722
Its going to go up a lot, 722, 729
People arent going to be able to afford it so Im not sure that it matters theyre just not going to be able to pay, 729, 754
Im asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save health care for every family in Florida and the United States, 754, 777

This is the biggest scandal since Watergate, 877, 884

Its about time, 912, 915
Remember its a rigged system remember its about time.n" She wants to blame everyone else for her mounting legal troubles but she really has no one to blame but herself, 915, 945
Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity, 945, 962

Its cheating the worst level, 1100, 1105
Instead of reporting this breach to an ethics committee or whoever would listen to the breach, 1105, 1121
So she got the answers cheating, 1121, 1127
She got the questions cheating, 1127, 1132
And then she—rather than reporting them rather than saying this shouldnt be happening—she used them against Bernie Sanders.n" "Can you imagine, 1132, 1153
she probably got them against me too except we won the debate so easy I dont think it mattered, 1153, 1172
