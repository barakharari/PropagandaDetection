Trump, 13, 14
Although originally a supporter of fellow Texan Senator Ted Cruz Congressman Farenthold says the time for contentious debate has passed and it is now time for the Republican Party to unify around its duly elected nominee, 14, 50
"I think were going to see some conservative motion in the country" said Farenthold on MSNBC in May, 50, 68
"The thing Im really most excited about is Donald Trump is a deal maker, 68, 82
I spent my six years in Congress with a my way or the highway president, 82, 97
I want a dealmaker who will come in and will get some stuff done and I think thats what the American people want, 97, 120
Theyre tired of gridlock in Washington." Farenthold said he believes Donald Trump should not stop talking about the scandals that have plagued the campaign of presumptive Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton, 120, 150
"Given the choice between Mr, 150, 155
Trump and Secretary Clinton this is a no-brainer, 155, 163
I dont want someone in the oval office that is extremely careless" Farenthold said, 163, 177
