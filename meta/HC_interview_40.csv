 But we start with the Democrats and a Hillary Clinton/Bernie Sanders race that has turned out to be much closer than the experts thought especially the Clinton campaign, 0, 28
In fact we have some brand new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll numbers out this morning and it does have some good news for the Clinton campaign, 28, 55
Nationally we still have her with a big lead over Bernie Sanders 59 percent-34 percent, 55, 70
But in Iowa the story has been very different, 70, 79
Three polls out this week alone showing neck and neck race including our own NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls which had Clinton leading by jut 3; Quinnipiac found Sanders actually up by 5 and the "Des Moines Register" had Clinton up by just 2, 79, 123
Bottom line its too close to call, 123, 130
So as they close the race it has become a more aggressive race against Sanders so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins Clinton campaign against Sanders and so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins us from Charleston South Carolina, 130, 171
Good morning—Secretary Clinton, 171, 174
 Good morning Chuck, 174, 177
 Let me start with the Iran deal, 177, 184
Yesterday in response to it you immediately said that Iran is still violating U.N, 184, 198
Security Council resolutions with its ballistic missile program which should be met with new sanctions designations and firm results, 198, 217
"So I guess my question is what do you tell the American public that says you want new sanctions against Iran theyre still violating agreement and yet what did we do? We just handed them $100 billion and we just did a prisoner exchange, 217, 261
Would you have still done that considering your concerns about their missile program?" " Absolutely, 261, 276
Look I have said for a long time that Im very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Irans nuclear weapons program but Ive also said that the way were going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U.N, 276, 354
Security Council has put on including on missiles." "So I see these as mutually reinforcing Chuck, 354, 370
I was delighted that the prisoners are on their way home, 370, 381
Thats a good sign, 381, 385
We still dont see Bob Levinson coming home theres more work to be done there, 385, 400
But if the implementation of the agreement which is being done today is to be successful in the way that I expect were going to watch Iran like the proverbial hawk." "And when it comes to the missile program they are under U.N, 400, 443
Security Council sanctions and if they are violating it which the evidence seems to suggest they should be held accountable, 443, 463
They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that were going to continue to be focused on."  Do you consider Iran a national security threat to the United States? " Well certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East, 463, 534
They continue to support proxies and terrorist groups like Hezbollah, 534, 544
They continue to threaten Israel, 544, 549
There are a lot of concerns, 549, 555
But what Ive said for some time now is Id rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us." " All right, 555, 612
Let me move to the campaign, 612, 618
To try to figure out why this race has gotten closer in Iowa why your lead has shrunk in Iowa we spoke to a number of voters, 618, 645
I want to play three sound bites from Iowa voters about some potential pause they have regarding your candidacy, 645, 664
Im going to play it and get you to respond on the other side."   " You get the impression from her that she believes maybe the rules dont apply to her, 664, 695
Or the same rules dont apply to her that apply to everybody else." " Shes worked really hard and done some amazing things I just feel that Bernie Sanders is kind of—has a little bit more fire lit up in people." " Well I hear people talking about questioning her honesty, 695, 746
And I dont necessarily do that but I think thats one thing people are kind of not sure and theyve felt that way about Bill Clinton too, 746, 773
So I think some of that rubs off."    Madam Secretary how do you answer that pause, 773, 789
This is from Democrats—some pause that they have, 789, 797
" Well first of all Chuck I always thought this was going to be close and I cant speak for anybody else but Ive worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1." "And Ive also been very consistent over the course of my public life, 797, 872
If I tell you Im going to fight for something I will do my very best to get results, 872, 891
I think thats why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but were going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1." " You know another problem you may be having in Iowa is that you dont ideologically fit, 891, 943
This was in the Des Moines Register poll this week, 943, 953
43 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identify as socialist, 953, 963
Only 38 percent of likely Democratic caucus goers identified themselves as a capitalist, 963, 976
You in the last debate said you were a capitalist, 976, 986
Bernie Sanders calls himself a Democratic socialist, 986, 993
If you dont win Iowa do you think thats the reason?" " Oh I dont know how people take all this information, 993, 1015
But I support a free market economy, 1015, 1022
I support the competitiveness that has created the greatest economic engine in the history of the world, 1022, 1039
What I am worried about is that its not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead." "Thats why Ive got a very vigorous jobs agenda, 1039, 1082
Thats why I put raising incomes at the center of my economic policy and I think what I know will work is to get back the good old-fashioned job opportunities that will help people get ahead through manufacturing through infrastructure through clean energy through the kinds of plans that Ive been putting out." "Look when we have a Democrat in the White House—a Democrat—we do that better economically, 1082, 1150
We saw that when my husband was president weve watched President Obama dig us out of the huge ditch that Republican policies put us into so Im very confident that I know what will work if we have a—the right commitment as a nation and thats what I want to do as president."  Let me ask you about whether—going with Chicago—right now Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been under fire for what he may have known about a shooting incident, 1150, 1229
Do you think he still has the credibility to heal the wounds in Chicago between the African-American community and law enforcement?  Look like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald, 1229, 1270
I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and in fact urged that it include the entire Chicago police department, 1270, 1297
"This is not a problem that is unique to Chicago unfortunately and weve got to do more to deal with the systemic racism and the problems that policing has demonstrated, 1297, 1327
Mayor Emanuel has said that he is committed to complete and total reform and I think he should be held to that standard."  But do you think he still has the credibility to do that? " Well thats going to be up to him and up to the people of Chicago to prove."  Very quickly the movie "13 Hours" about the incident in Benghazi, 1327, 1391
I know theres a lot of chatter about the movie itself, 1391, 1402
But let me ask you—the controversy involves whether or not everything was done that night to rescue Ambassador Stevens, 1402, 1421
Looking back do you believe everything was done that night that could have been done to save his life?  Based on everything I know and based on a Republican-led intelligence committee investigation is a Republican-led arms services committee investigation the answer to that is yes, 1421, 1466
That people were scrambling trying to figure out what could be done if anything, 1466, 1480
"And I cant speak to a movie but I know people have raised questions about some of the dramatization, 1480, 1499
I testified for more than 11 hours as you know I answered every question I was asked, 1499, 1516
My real focus Chuck is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harms way—military or civilian diplomats or our soldiers—we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it."  All right, 1516, 1575
Secretary Clinton I have to leave it there, 1575, 1583
We look forward to seeing you tonight on stage in Charleston for the Democratic debate, 1583, 1598
 Great, 1598, 1599
" Thats right here on NBC, 1599, 1605
Thank you."  Thanks a lot, 1605, 1610
 You got it, 1610, 1613
