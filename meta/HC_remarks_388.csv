"Hello Orlando! Wow, 0, 3
Thank you all so much, 3, 8
I am so happy to be back and I want to thank all of you for being here today at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center which does so much good work in the community, 8, 44
I want to acknowledge your terrific mayor Mayor Buddy Dyer who was here earlier, 44, 58
I want to thank Pastor Wynn Tiffany Namey the chair of the Orange County Disability Caucus and everyone – especially Val Demings, 58, 80
Wheres Val? Val – I know – got this crowd really whipped up and I want you to stay whipped up for Val, 80, 103
She is going to be a great member of Congress for everything that we care about and are fighting for, 103, 123
"I want to thank Anastasia for that introduction, 123, 131
Didnt she do an amazing job? I first met Anastasia when she was nine years old, 131, 147
She raised her hand at a town hall and she said My twin sister cant speak, 147, 163
Because of that they put her in a separate class apart from the rest of the kids, 163, 180
But she can communicate with a computer, 180, 187
And shes very smart and would do just as well as anyone else if the principal and teachers would just give her a chance, 187, 211
I was just blown away by this nine-year-old girl – her confidence and how much she loved her sister." "So Anastasia and I have stayed in touch over the years, 211, 241
When she grew up she became an intern in the Senate, 241, 252
I was so proud of her speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia too, 252, 267
And Im very excited that shes here with us today." "I also want to thank Orlando, 267, 283
Its great to be back in this wonderful city with all of you, 283, 296
Youve been through a lot this year, 296, 303
And what has been so notable is youve responded with grace, 303, 314
Youve shown the world what Orlando is made of – strength love and kindness, 314, 328
This is something we could all use more of right now." "Im here today to talk about how to make our economy work for everyone but first I need to say something about two very upsetting incidents that took place over the past few days, 328, 373
First an unarmed man named Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by a police officer in Tulsa, 373, 390
Then a man named Keith Lamont Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in Charlotte, 390, 407
Im sending condolences and prayers to their families; I know a lot of you are as well." "There is still much we dont know about what happened in both incidents, 407, 437
But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters, 437, 462
Its unbearable, 462, 464
And it needs to become intolerable." "We also saw the targeting of police officers in Philadelphia last week, 464, 482
And last night in Charlotte 12 officers were injured in demonstrations following Keith Lamont Scotts death, 482, 498
Every day police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage honor and skill, 498, 513
We saw that again this weekend in New York and New Jersey and Minnesota, 513, 527
Our police handled those terrorist attacks exactly right, 527, 535
And they likely saved a lot of lives, 535, 543
Ive spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am and deeply committed as I am to reform, 543, 570
Why? Because they know it is essential for the safety of our communities and our officers, 570, 586
We are safer when communities respect the police and police respect communities." "Ive also been privileged to spend a lot of time with mothers who have lost children and young people who feel that as far as their countrys concerned their lives seem disposable, 586, 630
Weve got to do better, 630, 635
And I know we can, 635, 640
And if Im elected president we will – and we will do it exactly together which is the only way it can be done." "Look I know I dont have all the answers, 640, 673
I dont know anyone who does, 673, 679
But this is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldnt have." "Sybrina Fulton has become a friend of mine, 679, 701
Her son Trayvon Martin was killed not far from where we are today, 701, 714
Sybrina says This is about saving our children, 714, 722
And shes absolutely right, 722, 726
We need to come together work together – white black Latino Asian all of us – to turn the tide stop the violence build the trust, 726, 752
We need to give all of our kids no matter who they are the chance to grow up safe and healthy in their communities and in our country." "Now there are so many issues we need to take on together and thats why were here today, 752, 798
Because in just 48 days – can you believe it 48 days – Americans will go to the polls and choose our next president, 798, 822
Well I hope so, 822, 826
I hope so, 826, 829
I want to just stress that our campaign is about the fundamental belief that in America every person no matter what you look like who you are who you love you should have the chance to go as far as your hard work and dreams will take you, 829, 877
And that is the basic bargain that made our country great and its our job to make sure its there for you and future generations." "Building an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top is the central challenge of our time, 877, 922
And I take it personally because Im a proud product of the American middle class, 922, 937
My grandfather started working in a lace mill in Scranton Pennsylvania when he was just a boy and worked there for 50 years, 937, 960
Thanks to him my dad was able to go to college and then start his own small business printing fabric for draperies, 960, 982
And because of my dad and my mom I could head out into the world and follow my dreams." Every American family should be able to write a similar story for themselves and their children, 982, 1017
And history has shown us – our history has shown us that the strongest growth in our economy is inclusive broad-based growth – when everyone can contribute to our prosperity and share in its rewards, 1017, 1052
"Now here is just one example, 1052, 1058
The flood of women into the American workforce over the past several decades was responsible for more than $3.5 trillion in economic growth, 1058, 1081
But as womens labor participation has slowed in recent years due in part to our failure to provide family-friendly policies like paid leave and affordable childcare so our economic growth wasnt as strong as it could have been, 1081, 1119
Women who want to work deserve to work, 1119, 1127
And whenever they are denied that opportunity its not fair to them – and we all lose out, 1127, 1145
In a competitive 21st century global economy we cannot afford to leave talent on the sidelines, 1145, 1161
When we leave people out or write them off we not only shortchange them and their dreams we shortchange our country and our own futures." "Thats one reason why I care so much about supporting working parents, 1161, 1198
Its one reason why Im such a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, 1198, 1211
Because bringing millions of undocumented workers into the formal economy will decrease abuse and exploitation and it will increase our economic breath and our tax base, 1211, 1237
It is estimated if we did this despite what you hear from the other side we would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion in 10 years, 1237, 1267
Now we need that." "Its also one reason why weve got to break down barriers of systemic racism including under-investment that has held communities of color back for generations, 1267, 1296
Thats part of building an inclusive economy too, 1296, 1304
And its why I believe we need to do more to help young people who are left behind in the wake of the Great Recession find those strategies and opportunities that will get them moving ahead again, 1304, 1341
And weve got to help older Americans whove displaced by automation and outsourcing in our changing economy." "And too often training and retraining doesnt work as it should, 1341, 1369
If you dont have a four-year degree if you havent really had the chance to upgrade your skills over the years its hard to just make a course correction, 1369, 1398
We need to have apprenticeships and community college and technical programs starting in high school and moving all the way up to older workers, 1398, 1422
Whether youre trying to start your career or youve spent decades contributing to our economy you deserve better." "Now these are some of the elements of my plan for an inclusive economy and Im going to hold up the book Tim Kaine and I have put out because weve actually put in one place all of our plans, 1422, 1480
You see we have this old-fashioned idea if were asking you to support us we should tell you what were going to do, 1480, 1503
Right? And today I want to focus on one area that hasnt gotten enough attention, 1503, 1518
It concerns a group of Americans who are too often invisible overlooked and undervalued who have so much to offer but are given too few chances to prove it, 1518, 1547
Now thats been true for a long time and we have to change it." "Im talking about people with disabilities men and women boys and girls who have talents skills ideas and dreams for themselves and their families just like anybody else, 1547, 1589
Whether they can participate in our economy and lead rich full lives that are as healthy and productive as possible is a reflection on us as a country, 1589, 1617
And right now in too many ways we are falling short, 1617, 1628
Weve got to face that and do better for everyones sake because this really does go to the heart of who we are as Americans, 1628, 1653
I intend this to be a vital aspect of my presidency." "I want to bring us together as a nation to recognize the humanity and support the potential of all of our people, 1653, 1686
And I want you to hear this because this is not well-known, 1686, 1698
Nearly one in five Americans lives with a disability, 1698, 1707
Now some of those disabilities are highly visible some much harder to notice, 1707, 1720
If you dont know you know someone with a disability I promise you you do, 1720, 1735
But their disability is just one part of who they are." "Across the country people with disabilities are running businesses teaching students caring for our loved ones, 1735, 1762
Theyre holding public office making breakthrough scientific discoveries reporting the news and creating art that inspires and challenges us, 1762, 1781
Theyre veterans whose service and sacrifice has protected our freedom and kept our country safe, 1781, 1796
Theyre working in the White House, 1796, 1802
Just last year a young woman named Leah Katz-Hernandez became the first West Wing receptionist who is deaf, 1802, 1820
So when world leaders come to the White House the person who greets them is Leah, 1820, 1836
Think of the message that sends about how our nation sees the talent in everyone." "And Americans with disabilities are working on presidential campaigns, 1836, 1860
I know because several of my staff and advisors have disabilities and theyre doing phenomenal work, 1860, 1876
Im grateful to them every single day, 1876, 1883
And people all over America would say the same about their boss their colleague their employee their family member with a disability." "Now over the past few days our country has taken leaps forward not just in recogniz-ing the humanity and dignity of people with disabilities but in making long-overdue changes in our schools workplaces and communities so everyone can be part of our shared American life, 1883, 1950
Even so not that long ago if you had a disability – if you couldnt see couldnt walk lived with dyslexia or muscular dystrophy or some other health issue – that one fact was allowed to define your entire life, 1950, 1990
Because of that and that alone the world was closed to you, 1990, 2002
Not all of it and not for everyone but for most people basic essential things that others could do you couldnt and never would, 2002, 2026
And that was that." "I saw this for myself as Anastasia said years ago when I was just starting out as a young lawyer working with the Childrens Defense Fund, 2026, 2056
One of my first assignments was to figure out why so many American kids werent in school, 2056, 2073
We looked at census tract numbers and we said okay, 2073, 2083
How many young people between five and 18 live in this census tract? Then we would look at school enrollment numbers and thered be a gap, 2083, 2109
And we would say wait a minute, 2109, 2116
Where are the kids? Why arent they in school?" "I went door to door along with people across our country going into different communities, 2116, 2140
I was in New Bedford Massachusetts, 2140, 2146
We saw a notable disparity there and I soon realized that part of the problem was kids were stuck at home because of disabilities, 2146, 2170
There were kids who were hard of hearing kids with intellectual disabilities, 2170, 2182
I remember one little girl in a wheelchair who was smart curious desperate to go to school, 2182, 2199
But that chair held her back, 2199, 2205
Not all schools had ramps or accessible bathrooms, 2205, 2213
Most teachers and aides werent trained to help her, 2213, 2222
So she didnt get to go, 2222, 2228
It felt like the world had said to her sorry kid, 2228, 2239
Your life just isnt going to be worth very much, 2239, 2249
And she and her family werent rich, 2249, 2256
They werent powerful, 2256, 2259
So what could they do about it?" "That little girl reminded me of another little girl my mother, 2259, 2277
She didnt face the same challenges but she too was clocked from a full and happy childhood – abandoned by her own parents raised by grandparents who didnt want her and ended up on her own when she was just 14 supporting herself as a housemaid, 2277, 2323
But then something finally went her way, 2323, 2330
The woman she worked for encouraged her to finish high school, 2330, 2341
And that family showed my mother what a happy family looked like, 2341, 2353
After many lonely years it was the start of a better life." "The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone, 2353, 2380
We all have to look out for each other and lift each other up, 2380, 2394
And I remembered that sitting with that little girl in a wheelchair, 2394, 2406
My colleagues and I at the Childrens Defense Fund along with others gathered the facts and we built a coalition of activists and families across America and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids." "So we opened the doors to school and then some years later I was so excited when the Americans with Disabilities Act finally passed 26 years ago, 2406, 2490
It was bipartisan, 2490, 2493
The notion that workplaces and public spaces belong to everyone was something Democrats and Republicans both supported, 2493, 2510
And by the way Im proud that some of the Democrats and Republicans who passed that landmark bill are supporting my campaign because they know where my heart is on this." "As Secretary of State I appointed the first-ever special advisor for international disability rights because I wanted America to stand up for the rights and dignity of people with disabilities all over the world, 2510, 2575
And over the years Ive spent a lot of time working for kids with disabilities, 2575, 2590
In addition to Anastasia who spoke at the convention another young man Ryan Moore also spoke there, 2590, 2607
I first met Ryan when he was 7 years old, 2607, 2617
I was fighting for health care reform, 2617, 2624
He was born with a rare form of dwarfism, 2624, 2633
But he never let that stop him, 2633, 2640
Hes had so many surgeries weve lost count of them, 2640, 2650
But his family was always there for them and – for him, 2650, 2662
And he was the advocate for himself as he got older, 2662, 2673
Now hes a college graduate working in the technology department of his local school district, 2673, 2688
And hes just one of the most optimistic people youll ever meet." Listening to Ryan and Anastasia tell their stories at the convention this July made me think about all the people who never got the chance never got the chance to get the education let alone go to college become forces for change, 2688, 2742
And I thought about all of the mothers and fathers across America who love their children more than anything and want so badly for them to have every opportunity that they deserve to have in America, 2742, 2778
"Ill never forget something that the actor Christopher Reeve said, 2778, 2788
Some of you may be too young to know who he was, 2788, 2800
He was a huge star, 2800, 2805
He played Superman, 2805, 2808
He was unbelievably good-looking, 2808, 2812
He and his wonderful wife were friends of mine, 2812, 2821
And then he was paralyzed in a horse-riding accident, 2821, 2830
He once said that he had been thinking about a phrase that comes up a lot in our politics family values, 2830, 2851
Since my accident he said Ive found a definition that seems to make sense, 2851, 2865
I think it means that were all family and we all have value, 2865, 2878
I couldnt agree more." "Weve come a long way since the fall of 1973 when I was going door to door talking to kids and families, 2878, 2904
But make no mistake, 2904, 2908
We still have a lot more work to do, 2908, 2917
We cant be satisfied not when over 60 percent of adults with disabilities arent in the workforce not when businesses are allowed to pay employees with disabilities a subminimum wage cheers and applause not when people with physical and intellectual disabilities are still subjected to stigma and discrimination every single day, 2917, 2968
Weve got to build an inclusive economy that welcomes people with disabilities values their work treats them with respect." "Now one advocate after another has told me the same thing We dont want pity, 2968, 3002
We want paychecks, 3002, 3005
We want the chance to contribute, 3005, 3011
As president Im going to give – give them that chance, 3011, 3022
First were going to focus on jobs and incomes, 3022, 3031
Im going to fight to give more Americans with disabilities the chance to work alongside those without disabilities and do the same jobs for the same pay and benefits, 3031, 3060
People with disabilities shouldnt be isolated, 3060, 3066
They should be given the chance to work with everyone else, 3066, 3077
And were going to eliminate the subminimum wage which is a vestige from an ugly ignorant past, 3077, 3094
Good work deserves fair pay no matter who you are." "Second were going to work with our colleges and universities to make them more accessible to students with disabilities, 3094, 3123
To have a truly inclusive economy we need a truly inclusive education system, 3123, 3136
So lets raise our standards, 3136, 3141
For too long accessibility has been an afterthought, 3141, 3149
Lets make it a priority in our curriculums our classrooms and the technology our students use, 3149, 3165
Its like what Anastasia said about her sister, 3165, 3173
She can communicate through a computer, 3173, 3179
Then lets make sure kids who can communicate that way have the opportunity to do so." "Third were going to partner with businesses and other stakeholders to ensure those living with a disability can get hired and stay hired, 3179, 3218
As part of that well launch a new effort were calling Autism Works to help people with autism succeed in the workplace." "Fourth lets build on the success of the Americans with Disabilities Act by finally ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 3218, 3266
It has the strong backing of leaders across the political spectrum and its a chance to show American values and American leadership, 3266, 3288
And I have to tell you ever since I was first lady I have had the great privilege of traveling the world on behalf of our country, 3288, 3315
When I was secretary of state I went to 112 countries, 3315, 3326
And one of the things that I have noticed is how far behind many countries are in how they treat people with disabilities, 3326, 3349
Very often people with disabilities from the time they are babies and toddlers are locked away basically forgotten, 3349, 3367
I want us since we have been the leader in this area to get that ratified and then to demonstrate to other countries what we have done and are doing to give dignity and opportunity to people with disabilities." "Now these ideas are just a start, 3367, 3413
Were working with advocates to come up with even more, 3413, 3423
If youve got an idea we want to hear it, 3423, 3433
Go to hillaryclinton.com and leave your ideas because we are really welcoming this debate, 3433, 3447
This issue is very close to my heart." "Ive always believed that the ultimate test of our society is more than the size of our economy or the strength of our military, 3447, 3479
Its how we treat our fellow human beings especially the most vulnerable among us, 3479, 3493
And on this front especially I intend for my presidency to move our country forward, 3493, 3508
Together we will make our economy and our country more welcoming to people with disabilities because we all win when everyone gets to share in the American dream." "Now if you want some proof let me tell you this story, 3508, 3548
Its a story of a woman named Freia David, 3548, 3557
Now some of you may have read about Freia in the Boston Globe, 3557, 3570
Ive carried a copy of that article around with me because I loved it so much, 3570, 3586
Freia has Down syndrome, 3586, 3590
When she was 21 she got her first job at the local McDonalds, 3590, 3603
Her mother was a little worried as any mother would be, 3603, 3614
She wondered would Freia be able to handle being independent? Could she handle the job? Would she even pass the six-month training program? Well not everyone in her class passed but Freia did, 3614, 3647
And then – then she excelled at that job for 32 years, 3647, 3659
Her colleagues loved her and she loved them, 3659, 3667
The restaurant became such a home to her that shed bring her family there on off days just to hang out." "Earlier this year Freia began to show signs of early-onset dementia, 3667, 3699
She knew that meant she had to stop working but 32 years is a pretty good run isnt it? It broke her heart, 3699, 3722
One thing that made it a little better is the whole staff threw a party in her honor, 3722, 3740
Her family hoped a few people might show up, 3740, 3749
And in the end nearly 100 people did: customers colleagues and friends from over the years, 3749, 3765
The party lasted three hours, 3765, 3770
And at one point one of Freias former managers asked for everyones attention, 3770, 3783
She turned to Freia and she said We love you, 3783, 3793
We appreciate you, 3793, 3796
We respect you, 3796, 3799
And we are all better people for having you in our lives." "My friends after years of hard work and treating people right isnt that what we all want to hear? Isnt that America at our best? We dont thrive on tearing each other apart or separating ourselves, 3799, 3847
We know we are stronger together, 3847, 3853
We believe in equality and dignity for all, 3853, 3861
And when we fall short we strive to do better not to blame and scapegoat but to improve ourselves to move toward becoming that more perfect union that our founders hoped for, 3861, 3893
This election is a chance for us to move still closer to that goal to make sure everyone can contribute to a growing and prospering America to say loudly and clearly in this country no ones worthless no ones less than, 3893, 3934
Were all of value, 3934, 3938
In the United States of America the greatest country in the world we believe everyone is created equal, 3938, 3956
And you know what else we believe? We all believe love trumps hate." Thank you all." , 3956, 3972
