"To strengthen our democracy we need to get secret unaccountable money out of our politics and get the voices of Americans back in, 12, 35
Every Voice is leading that fight, 35, 41
They uncover how special interests interfere with our democracy and block progress on critical issues like addressing climate change preventing gun violence and raising the minimum wage, 41, 68
And they have smart concrete ideas on how to change our broken campaign finance system, 68, 83
"Ive made campaign finance reform a cornerstone of my campaign from the beginning, 83, 96
If elected this will be a top priority for my presidency, 96, 107
And I will be a strong partner to everyone working toward that goal, 107, 120
"In my first 30 days in office I will propose a constitutional amendment to overturn the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision, 120, 142
Ill appoint Supreme Court justices who understand how deeply that decision damaged our democracy, 142, 156
Well work to amplify the voices of Americans and make it easier for citizens to run for office by supporting small-donor matching, 156, 178
And well fight for more robust disclosure requirements, 178, 186
"The United States is the worlds oldest democracy and the greatest country in the world, 186, 201
I believe deeply that our democracy should work for everyone not just the wealthy and well-connected, 201, 217
Weve got to do better, 217, 222
Organizations like Every Voice are working to do that every day, 222, 233
As President I will be their partner." , 233, 240
