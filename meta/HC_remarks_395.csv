"Thank you! Boy! Wow! Thank you! Wow! Did anybody see that debate last night? Oh yes, 0, 16
One down two to go, 16, 21
I am so excited to be back here at Wake Tech, 21, 32
I was here 8 years ago and I was so impressed then with the kinds of programs and opportunities that are offered here to people like Christine that I wanted to come back of course to Raleigh but I wanted to come back here to Wake Tech, 32, 79
When Christine was talking I was backstage watching her on a screen we had there, 79, 94
And she kept saying about how she was about to cry, 94, 105
I was about to cry, 105, 110
Her story says so much not just about her but about our country, 110, 123
We are a country of second chances and third and fourth chances for people willing to work for them get up every day do their best, 123, 149
Thats the basic bargain of America, 149, 155
And I was really proud of Christine, 155, 162
" Were proud of you!" " Thank you, 162, 170
Thank you, 170, 172
And I think her – I think her patients at Duke Regional are in for a treat because not only the skills that she learned here at Wake Tech but that personality that get-up-and-go personality is going to mean a lot to the people shes taking care of, 172, 220
So Christine thank you and Godspeed." "Now I have to thank – I have to thank Dr, 220, 237
Stephen Scott the president of Wake Tech Community College all the administrators the faculty and the students of Wake Tech, 237, 257
Now Dr, 257, 259
Scott told me that the enrollments about 73000, 259, 267
And what a tribute to what this institution represents, 267, 276
And I am a huge huge supporter, 276, 283
I just see America differently, 283, 288
I think theres nothing we cant do if we make our minds up roll up our sleeves get working together support institutions like Wake Tech support people like Christine, 288, 317
And thats what I intend to do." "Now I want to thank your mayor Mayor McFarlane, 317, 333
Thank you so much for being here, 333, 340
State Senator Dan Blue Jr, 340, 345
I also want to recognize Linda Coleman candidate for lieutenant governor of North Carolina, 345, 359
Linda came so close last time, 359, 365
And this time are you going to bring her over the finish line? And Ill tell you somebody else Im really excited about, 365, 388
That is the Democratic candidate for the Senate former State Representative Deborah Ross, 388, 401
I have watched – I have watched the campaign shes run and the intensity and the incredible passion that she brings to it, 401, 424
Ill tell you what we sure could use her in Washington representative North Carolina, 424, 438
I want to thank all the elected officials who are here and I want to do a special shout-out to a long-time friend of my husbands and mine somebody who we admire so much who did really transform this state during his governorship, 438, 481
Thats former Governor Jim Hunt." "Now theres a lot that I want to talk about today, 481, 497
But let me start with this because you may or may not know, 497, 510
Today is National Voter Registration Day, 510, 516
And you see some signs people are holding, 516, 524
I Will Vote, 524, 527
Now thats not only a great sign that shows youre committed to vote but its a website, 527, 544
And you can go to iwillvote.com to make sure you are registered, 544, 556
And I hope you all will and I hope youll tell everybody that you know to do the same because we want to make sure people are registered." "And there is still time to get registered here in North Carolina and I hope that you will because think about everything thats at stake in this election right here in North Carolina, 556, 617
The very mean-spirited wrong-headed decision by your legislature and governor to pass and sign House Bill 2 has hurt this state, 617, 638
But more than that its hurt people, 638, 645
It has sent a message to so many people that well youre not really wanted, 645, 660
Youre not really part of us, 660, 666
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody." "The other thing your governor and legislature did was everything they could to make voting harder for people, 666, 694
Now they were pretty blatant about it, 694, 701
Make it harder for people of color, 701, 708
Make it harder for the elderly, 708, 714
And make it harder for the young, 714, 721
Now some of thats been rolled back thankfully because it was so wrong and I would argue unconstitutional, 721, 739
But the best way to show hey in a democracy like ours we can have the most vigorous vibrant debate thats what its about, 739, 763
But we want everybody to exercise his or her right to vote, 763, 775
Thats the way were supposed to be making decisions, 775, 784
It distorts our democracy if some groups of people try to prevent other people from being able to do that." "Now I have won elections and I have lost elections so I know what the difference is, 784, 821
But Ill tell you this: I believe in what our founders established for us to govern ourselves to continue to widen the circle of opportunity and that includes the opportunity to be heard to express yourself your voice and your vote, 821, 862
And the best way to reaffirm our commitment to that fundamental American value is to show up and vote and demonstrate the importance of your vote." "I believe that we may have a record-setting turnout in this election, 862, 900
Some folks who follow this are saying we could have the biggest turnout weve ever had, 900, 916
Now that kind of makes sense because you could not have two more different visions about where we want our country to go in the future and who we are fighting for, 916, 948
But early information is actually quite encouraging, 948, 955
Were seeing spikes in early voting, 955, 961
And were seeing voting rates among African Americans Latinos and young people going up, 961, 975
And for the first time the estimate is that young people could represent 25 percent of the vote." "Now I would love to see that, 975, 1000
Obviously I hope people vote for me, 1000, 1007
But I would love to see that because every election is about the future, 1007, 1021
And honestly its more about the future of young people and children than its ever been because of the difference in the approaches and the experiences of me and my opponent." "Now last night I got a chance – I got a chance to say a few things about what I want to do if Im so fortunate enough to be elected as your president, 1021, 1086
And I do have this old-fashioned idea that if Im asking for your vote I should tell you what I want to do, 1086, 1109
And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together, 1109, 1123
You see I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren." "And I also got to convey my excitement about what we can do together, 1123, 1172
You see I really think the central question in this election is what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we want to build for our children and our grandchildren, 1172, 1207
I think about that a lot in part because I started out working for the Childrens Defense Fund, 1207, 1225
Its always been my passion about what we can do applause to help more kids live up to their God-given potential." "And during this campaign people have asked me Well how did you get interested in that?And the simple answer is my mother had such a neglected childhood, 1225, 1273
She was basically abandoned by her parents sent to live with grandparents who didnt want her, 1273, 1289
By the age of 14 she was out on her own working in a home babysitting keeping house, 1289, 1307
She was basically a maid, 1307, 1312
And when I think about my mothers own life and how she told me when I was old enough to understand how different her life was than the one that she created for me and my brothers she would say she was so often saved by the kindness of other people." "We overlook the importance of just how we treat each other the respect we show the kindness the love that we show, 1312, 1385
And Im well aware thats not something you put necessarily on a campaign website but Ive been talking about it because I think weve got to re-assert our fundamental connection to each other." "When my mother was in first grade she never had any food and her first grade teacher noticed that, 1385, 1437
In those days they just brought food a little bag of food then theyd sit in the classroom and eat it and my mother never had any food, 1437, 1465
And that first grade teacher noticed that and began to bring extra food but without embarrassing her, 1465, 1482
She would say You know Dorothy I brought too much food, 1482, 1493
Would you like this sandwich? Would you like this milk? And it wasnt until she herself was much older that my mother realized that that teacher fed her for that school year something she didnt have to do but her love for her students her recognition of a child who wasnt well taken care of meant that she stepped in." "And then when my mother worked as a maid she really wanted to go to high school, 1493, 1570
She started working right before she would have been in high school because she had to get out of her grandparents home, 1570, 1592
And the woman she worked for realized how much my mother wanted to go to high school and so she said to her If you get up early – it sounds like Christine getting up so early, 1592, 1629
If you get up early and you get your chores done you can go to high school, 1629, 1646
And thats what my mother did for four years she got up early and then she literally had to run run to get to high school, 1646, 1672
It sounds harsh but not for my mom, 1672, 1680
She thought it was such a great gift of kindness that this woman gave her a place to live gave her food to eat gave her the chance to go to high school." "So when I talk about us being stronger together Im not just talking about what our government needs to do Im talking about what each of us can do to contribute, 1680, 1744
We do need to make sure – we need to make sure that our economy does work for everyone not just those at the top and that means weve got to make investments in more good new jobs infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs technology and innovation clean renewable energy jobs, 1744, 1794
And weve got to do more to help small businesses because thats where most of the new jobs will come from." "As I said last night my dad was a small businessman, 1794, 1826
When he got out of the Navy after World War II he started this small business printing drapery fabrics and he had a print plant in Chicago, 1826, 1853
It was just – it was dark room, 1853, 1861
There was no natural light, 1861, 1866
He had two long tables and hed spread that fabric on the table and then he would take silkscreens – if youve ever seen one – and hed start at one end and hed put it down hed pour the paint in and hed take the squeegee and hed lift it up and hed go all the way down to the end of one table and then hed start on the other table and he would do that until he got the job done, 1866, 1950
And I would help him out from time to time so I knew how hard he worked, 1950, 1967
But he was so proud that he could give us a good middle class life because his dad was a factory worker, 1967, 1989
And so he was able to do what we want to see in America keep going keep reaching move as high as your hard work and ambition will take you." "So I want us to have an economy that works for everyone to grow the economy to create more jobs but I also want a fairer economy because – when you work hard you should not be still in poverty at the end of the year, 1989, 2065
But if you are a minimum wage worker if you work full time minimum wage you will make $15000 a year, 2065, 2086
Two-thirds of minimum wage workers are women most of them with families to support, 2086, 2100
And Ive talked to a lot of these women, 2100, 2109
Sometimes Ill be at a café or sometimes Ill be in a store and Ill just start talking to them and they will tell me – its one of the most humbling experiences about being out there talking to people is that if youre open to it folks will tell you whats on their minds and their hearts." "So Ive met women who are working two full-time minimum wage jobs to make enough to be able to support their kids, 2109, 2189
So we need to raise the national minimum wage and – and we need to guarantee finally equal pay for womens work because – number one its fair, 2189, 2217
Its fair, 2217, 2219
And if your mother your wife your sister or your daughter is working dont you want to see her paid what she should be paid for the work she does?" And the other thing I want to do I want to make sure that more companies offer profit-sharing to their employees who help make the profits in the first place, 2219, 2279
It makes no sense to me that sharing in profits would only go to the top executives, 2279, 2296
I want more people in more jobs to realize the benefit of their hard work, 2296, 2311
And last night at the debate one of my guests was Mark Cuban, 2311, 2324
Now Mark Cuban who is a real billionaire by the way he has used profit-sharing from his very first successful business and he not only used it while the business was going but when the business was sold, 2324, 2362
He shared the profits from the sale and made 300 of his employees millionaires overnight, 2362, 2377
"Now thats the kind of business leadership I want to hold up because what weve seen from my opponent is someone who his own campaign manager has said builds a lot of businesses on the back of the little guy stiffing people – dishwashers painters plumbers architects glass installers marble installers drapery installers – across America, 2377, 2433
Some of them have come forward, 2433, 2439
You can go to our website; you can see their stories, 2439, 2450
Its heartbreaking, 2450, 2452
And as I said last night Im really glad my dad never had a contract with Donald Trump when he was running his small business." "And in addition to making the economy fair weve got to make it work better for working families who are trying to balance family and work, 2452, 2503
Its really hard out there isnt it? And just listening to Christines story – getting up at 4:00 and studying getting kids up at 7:00 going to school going to work going to another job – thats not an uncommon story, 2503, 2544
Weve made it really hard for a lot of people." "So heres what I think we need to do and its not a luxury its a necessity – because I want more families to be able to go as far as their hard work will take them, 2544, 2591
And Ive heard so many stories, 2591, 2597
Theyve told me – people have told me about the difficult choices they face and the stresses theyre under, 2597, 2616
So lets finally since every other advanced economy has already done this lets have paid family leave so that when youre sick or your spouse or your child is sick or you have a newborn you can take care of your loved ones, 2616, 2659
And lets have earned sick days so that you dont lose your job because youre sick or you go to work because youre sick, 2659, 2683
And lets finally have affordable childcare which in lots of states costs as much or more than in-state college tuition, 2683, 2703
I dont think any family should ever have to pay more than 10 percent of your income for childcare and were going to fix that so that becomes the norm, 2703, 2733
And then lets make sure that every educational opportunity is available without sending you into debt and breaking your budget." "Now tomorrow in New Hampshire Bernie Sanders and I are going to talk about the college plan for debt-free college at public universities that he and I have worked on since the end of our primary, 2733, 2789
And I want – I want every family in North Carolina to know help is on the way, 2789, 2807
And were also going to work so that you can refinance the debt you already have at much lower rates and get it paid off a lot sooner." "Now how are we going to do that? Well were going to go where the money is and the money is at the top, 2807, 2859
Were going to go after millionaires billionaires and corporations, 2859, 2868
Were going to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires and were going to close corporate loopholes, 2868, 2884
And I believe that we can get that done in part because youre going to send Deborah Ross to the Senate so were going to have another Democratic senator, 2884, 2913
But also because our government needs to start working for everybody again – not just those who have lobbyists and lawyers and influence, 2913, 2936
That hasnt worked out so well, 2936, 2942
Weve got to get back to first principles, 2942, 2950
Our job is to give the maximum opportunities to the maximum number of Americans and to especially focus on people who are working their way out of poverty and people in the middle class who want to go as far as they can go, 2950, 2994
Lets be a government for the struggling the striving and the successful." "So Im excited about what we can do, 2994, 3014
I really am, 3014, 3017
And Im going to leave it to the fact-checkers to go through all of – all of Donald Trumps claims, 3017, 3037
There were – there was a lot of work for fact-checkers last night, 3037, 3050
But heres a couple of things that caught my attention, 3050, 3060
He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share of taxes, 3060, 3077
In fact I think theres a strong probability he hasnt paid federal taxes a lot of years, 3077, 3094
And this is a man who goes around calling our military a disaster; who goes around criticizing every institution from health care to education our vets, 3094, 3120
But he probably hasnt paid a penny to support our troops or our vets or our schools or our health care systems." "And when I confronted him with the reasons why he wont release his tax returns – and I got to that point where I said well maybe hes paid zero – he said that makes him smart, 3120, 3179
Now if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make all the rest of us? I got to tell you Bill and I have been blessed, 3179, 3207
We didnt come from millionaire families, 3207, 3213
My husbands father – his biological father died before he was born, 3213, 3225
His mother went to nursing school in order to support him, 3225, 3236
They struggled, 3236, 3238
They worked hard, 3238, 3241
And America gave him the chance to get a good education pursue his dreams end up being President, 3241, 3259
My dad as I told you worked hard." "So Bill and I have released all of our tax returns going back 40 years, 3259, 3282
And if you look youll see that we paid the highest marginal rate, 3282, 3295
We tried to give 10 percent to charity, 3295, 3303
Because we believe in this country and we believe with the blessings that weve been given we should do our part." "The other thing he admitted last night was that he actually rooted for the housing crisis to happen, 3303, 3342
I dont think Id make a big bragging point out of that, 3342, 3354
But he seemed to feel like hey it shows you how smart I am, 3354, 3368
He basically said Yeah if the housing market crashes I can go in and buy stuff and make some more money, 3368, 3389
I got to tell you what kind of person believes that? What kind of person would want to root for nine million families losing their homes? One who should never be president is the answer to that question." "And he made it very clear that he didnt prepare for that debate, 3389, 3440
At one point he was kind of digging me for spending time off the campaign trail to get prepared, 3440, 3459
But just trying to keep track of everything he says took a lot of time and effort, 3459, 3476
And I said Yeah, 3476, 3480
You know what? I did prepare, 3480, 3486
And Ill tell you something else I prepared for, 3486, 3495
I prepared to be president of the United States and I think thats good." "So as I said in the beginning we have two different visions here, 3495, 3522
I believe we are stronger together, 3522, 3528
That is at the core of what Ive done over my years in advocacy and public service, 3528, 3545
I believe that America is already great and it is our responsibility to make it even greater, 3545, 3562
I believe that as we make our economy work for everyone we also need to keep our country safe and we need to provide strong steady leadership in the world with our allies and our partners, 3562, 3598
Ive laid out my views on a range of national security and foreign policy issues, 3598, 3613
Ive laid out my plan for defeating and destroying ISIS, 3613, 3623
And what we hear from my opponent is dangerously incoherent, 3623, 3633
Its unclear exactly what he is saying." But words matter, 3633, 3643
And last night it sounded like he was basically telling our treaty allies in Asia "Hey were not sure were going to be there for you even though we have a mutual defense treaty." Words matter, 3643, 3679
People here that and they start to doubt Americas word Americas intention, 3679, 3691
I felt like I had to jump in and say I just want to be clear, 3691, 3707
We will honor our treaties, 3707, 3712
We will support our allies and our partners, 3712, 3720
"This is not reality TV, 3720, 3725
This is real, 3725, 3728
Its as real as it gets, 3728, 3734
so were going to get the economy working for everybody not just those at the top, 3734, 3750
Were going to keep America safe provide strong steady leadership and we are going to bring our country together across the divides that have pitted Americans against each other, 3750, 3779
Economic worries are not the only ones keeping families up at night are they? Theres still a lot we dont know about the recent incidents in Tulsa and Charlotte but this we do know: Weve got to bring communities together, 3779, 3819
We have to listen to each other, 3819, 3826
We have to make it clear that everyone is safer when there is respect from the law for the communities they protect and respect for the law from the communities that are protected." "And weve got to do something about the epidemic of gun violence that has taken too many too many lives in our country, 3826, 3882
Again I think we can come together, 3882, 3889
A very long majority of Americans and a majority of gun owners believe in comprehensive background checks, 3889, 3906
They believe in the Second Amendment as I do, 3906, 3915
They believe in the right of individuals to have guns as I do, 3915, 3928
But they believe along with me that we should not let guns fall into the wrong hands of people who will use them to kill other people and make it so easy to get them." "So theres work to do, 3928, 3968
But its great work, 3968, 3972
Its important work starting right here in North Carolina, 3972, 3981
We have 42 days left, 3981, 3986
This elections going to be close, 3986, 3992
They all are these days, 3992, 3997
Thats why every call you make every door you knock on every friend you register to vote to make the difference, 3997, 4018
I want you if you can to text join j-o-i-n to 47246 or go to hillaryclinton.com and sign up to volunteer here in North Carolina, 4018, 4043
And I know theres a big overflow room and Im told they can hear me so to my friends in the overflow we want you to be just as involved as anyone else, 4043, 4076
Thank you for coming." "So remember here in North Carolina starting on October 20th you can register and vote early at the same time at any one-stop early voting site in your county, 4076, 4109
And remember its not just the presidential race, 4109, 4117
Its the governors race the lieutenant governors race the U.S, 4117, 4127
Senate race and other races up and down the ticket, 4127, 4137
Because we want to prove who we are as Americans in this election, 4137, 4150
Were not fearful, 4150, 4153
We dont want to build walls, 4153, 4159
We want to build bridges, 4159, 4164
We dont want to turn against each other, 4164, 4172
We want to work with one another, 4172, 4179
We want to set big goals again here in our country." "Ive got some big goals that I know we can achieve, 4179, 4201
Take climate change which my opponent says is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, 4201, 4215
I think it could be one of the biggest economic opportunities our country has ever seen and I want us to take advantage of that, 4215, 4240
Do the right thing and benefit from it, 4240, 4248
Thats what Im offering, 4248, 4252
Were going to deploy a half a billion more solar panels in the first four years of my administration, 4252, 4271
And we will produce enough clean power to power every home in America within 10 years, 4271, 4287
And were going to lead the world because some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, 4287, 4309
Now the way things are stacking up I think its either going to be Germany China or us, 4309, 4327
I want it to be us and it will be us." That is exactly right, 4327, 4342
I love this country, 4342, 4346
Im proud of this country, 4346, 4351
I want to be a leader who brings people together in our country sets those goals gets about the business of achieving them and proves once and for all that love trumps hate, 4351, 4384
Thank you!" , 4384, 4386
