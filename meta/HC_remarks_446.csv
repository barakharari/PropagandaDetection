Go Daytona Beach! Wow, 0, 4
Thank you, 4, 6
Thank you so much, 6, 10
Chants of "Hillary." Thank you all, 10, 16
Wow, 16, 17
Thank you, 17, 19
Thank you, 19, 21
I am just thrilled to be here, 21, 28
Are you Im ready to canvass? Well we need your help in these last 10 days until the election.n "I want to thank Leslie Pearce for that introduction and her lifelong work on behalf of children, 28, 64
I want to thank State Representative Dwayne Taylor and Mayor Derrick Henry for being here with us, 64, 81
And to all of the elected officials all of the organizers and the volunteers I am thrilled to have this chance to come by and talk with you for a few minutes about whats at stake in this election because this may be one of the most important elections in our lifetimes, 81, 133
And we cannot take anything or anyone for granted.n" "I was just over at BCU for their homecoming celebration, 133, 152
And a lot of people told me they had already voted but I said Get your friends, 152, 169
Get your family, 169, 172
Get everybody you know to vote because youve got early voting here in this county in Volusia County until November 5th, 172, 193
No excuses, 193, 195
Everybodys got to get out and vote, 195, 202
And thats what this canvass is meant to make sure we do, 202, 214
Right?n" "Now Im sure that some of you may have heard about a letter that the FBI director sent out yesterday, 214, 235
Well if youre like me you probably have a few questions about it, 235, 248
It is pretty strange, 248, 252
Its pretty strange to put something like that out with such little information right before an election, 252, 269
In fact in fact its not just strange, 269, 277
Its unprecedented, 277, 279
And it is deeply troubling because voters deserve get to full and complete facts, 279, 293
And so weve called on Director Comey to explain everything right away put it all out on the table, 293, 312
Right?n" "Now of course Donald Trump is already making up lies about this, 312, 325
He is doing his best to confuse mislead and discourage the American people, 325, 338
I think its time for Donald Trump to stop fear mongering to stop disgracing himself to stop attacking our democracy, 338, 358
We cant let him get away with this can we?n" "Now like any campaign there have been ups and downs and ups and downs but Ive got to tell you I feel so motivated so excited so ready because Ive always stayed focused on one thing: you and your families, 358, 408
What I worry about are the problems that keep you up at night and Im going to stay focused on that because you know on November 9th thats whats going to matter, 408, 440
We cant let this election in the last 10 days be about the noise and the distractions, 440, 457
Its got to be about what kind of country we want for ourselves our children and our grandchildren – and who can help take us there as your president.n"  n "Now I think you and I agree the choice is pretty clear between a president whos ready to bring us together keep us safe and make the economy work for everyone not just those at the top and someone who is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job.n" "Now I promise you this: I will never stop working for you every single day as a candidate and most importantly as your president, 457, 560
Thats how I was raised, 560, 565
When I was over at B-CU I met one of the Methodist ministers because B-CU is affiliated with the Methodist Church and I felt right at home, 565, 592
And my mother – my mother taught me to never ever quit, 592, 604
Now what does that mean? Well that means everybody gets knocked down, 604, 616
What matters is whether you get back up, 616, 624
And Ive been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life and Im not stopping now, 624, 640
Were just getting started.n" "And lets always remember what our wonderful First Lady told us: When they go low we go high, 640, 662
So no matter what they throw at us in these last days were not going to back down, 662, 680
Were not going to get distracted, 680, 686
Were not going to get knocked off course, 686, 694
Because we know how much the election matters, 694, 702
We know how many people are counting on us, 702, 711
And thats why were going to reject Donald Trumps dark and divisive vision about America.n" "We are going to stick together and we are going to win on November the 8th, 711, 742
Right? Because Donald Trumps strategy is pretty simple, 742, 750
Theyve even said it in his campaign, 750, 757
Its to get women to stay home get young people to stay home get people of color to stay home and get a lot – get a lot of smart intelligent men to stay home too, 757, 793
Now this is all part of his scorched earth campaign, 793, 803
It goes against everything we stand for, 803, 810
And you know how we stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout of voters in American history.n" "We need more of everybody to vote – more women more young people more people of color more African Americans more Latinos everybody, 810, 852
Lets break every record that weve ever had for voting, 852, 862
Lets make that the story of this election, 862, 870
And here in Florida you can as you often have make the difference, 870, 883
Right Florida? If you all vote and you get everybody you know to vote if you go out and talk to people today and every day about whats at stake in this election then we will make history, 883, 921
We will win up and down the ballot, 921, 929
And I feel strongly about this because we need people in Washington who are problem-solvers not problem-makers, 929, 946
Thats why I hope youll vote to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate, 946, 959
He will be an independent voice for Florida families, 959, 968
And this is important: Unlike his opponent Patrick has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.n" "Now heres some really good news, 968, 992
We just reached a milestone, 992, 997
More than 200 million Americans are registered to vote, 997, 1006
That is the highest number ever, 1006, 1012
And that includes 50 million young people, 1012, 1019
Thats the most in history, 1019, 1024
And you know what else? More than 16.5 million people have already voted in this election, 1024, 1040
And more than 3 million of those votes have been right here in Florida, 1040, 1054
Now you only see numbers like were seeing here in Florida when people are standing up for what they really believe in, 1054, 1076
Americans are coming together and I know because I hear from people who are Republicans and Independents who are joining us to reject hate and division rejecting Donald Trumps demeaning treatment of women his plans to break up immigrant families and deport millions of people his lie that President Obama wasnt born in America.n" "Ill tell you we have learned who Donald Trump is, 1076, 1140
Now its up to us to show who we are, 1140, 1150
And the energy that we are seeing is not just about what were against its about what were for, 1150, 1169
Its about a common vision that we share for a hopeful dynamic unified America where everyone counts everyone has a place everyone willing to work can get ahead and stay ahead where women are respected – where veterans are honored where workers are paid fairly where marriage is a right and discrimination is wrong.n" So my friends it is not just the fact that my name will be on the ballot, 1169, 1240
Everything we care about is at stake – your future – making college affordable helping you pay back your debt – the cost of prescription drugs down – protecting and defending Social Security and Medicare from privatization and Wall Street schemes, 1240, 1281
Fighting climate change is at stake, 1281, 1287
LGBT equality is at stake, 1287, 1292
Equal pay for women is at stake, 1292, 1299
In the end we know that American dream itself is at stake.n Now did any of you see the debates?"n  "Yes."n  "Well Ill tell you I stood next to Donald Trump for three debates four and a half hours proving conclusively I have the stamina to be president and commander-in-chief, 1299, 1349
But I have to tell you he said a lot of things that were troubling, 1349, 1364
But in that last debate he said something that was truly horrifying, 1364, 1376
He is the first person of a major party Republican or Democrat ever to refuse to say he would respect the outcome of the election, 1376, 1401
Now we can think about every issue we care about but you know after attacking women and African Americans and Latinos and people with disabilities and Muslims and POWs and everybody now hes attacking the institutions of democracy, 1401, 1439
And so it comes down to this, 1439, 1446
When your kids and grandkids ask What did you do in the 2016 election when everything was on the line I want you to be able to say you voted for a better fairer stronger America.n "And the way were going to do that: Were going to turn everybody out, 1446, 1496
Early voting has begun right here in Volusia County, 1496, 1505
Every day from 7 a.m, 1505, 1510
to 7 p.m, 1510, 1513
until November 5th you can vote, 1513, 1519
The nearest early voting site is just one mile away from here at the Volusia County Library Center in City Island, 1519, 1540
So dont wait one more day, 1540, 1546
Go vote and then help us get everybody else out to vote too.n" "Now I know – I know that weve got our canvass organizers up here, 1546, 1573
I dont want to take too much of their time because they are workers they are organized they are focused, 1573, 1593
Im so grateful to them and to you and we need you, 1593, 1605
We need you, 1605, 1608
Stakes couldnt be higher, 1608, 1612
We got to do everything we can, 1612, 1619
I dont want anybody waking up on November 9th and saying Oh I wish I had just done a little more, 1619, 1640
So help us knock on doors make phone calls talk to voters and ask them When are you going to vote? Do you know where youre going to cast your ballot? Who will you take with you? And make sure they know about early voting already begun here in Florida, 1640, 1690
And then if you need to sign up yourselves, 1690, 1699
We have signups for three more shifts between now and Election Day, 1699, 1711
And this is going to be a close election; they always are these days, 1711, 1725
And were going to win because of you because of hardworking volunteers like you, 1725, 1739
And if you know anybody thinking about voting for Donald Trump stage an intervention, 1739, 1753
Remember friends dont let friends vote for Trump.n" "And think about it this way, 1753, 1767
On January 20th were going to have a new president, 1767, 1777
And Ill tell you what I will be proud to build on the progress weve made under President Obama and go even further, 1777, 1800
But I cant do any of the things that Im talking about any of the plans that I have unless you help me, 1800, 1823
So thats what Im asking you, 1823, 1829
Thats why I came to Daytona Beach today, 1829, 1837
I came to ask you to help me in these last ten days, 1837, 1850
Lets give every American a chance to chart their own future make their own contributions, 1850, 1865
Lets build a future we can all be proud of and lets make sure we prove once and for all that love trumps hate.n" Thank you, 1865, 1891
