"Thank you, 0, 2
Thank you very much, 2, 6
Oh Jon, 6, 8
Jon is such a great actor and such a great person, 8, 19
He is such a great person, 19, 25
And hes really been with me a long time in a lot of different ways, 25, 40
Hes been incredible, 40, 43
So I just want to thank Jon, 43, 50
And I hope he makes another movie very quickly because I love his movies, 50, 64
"  In particular I wanted to thank our host Tony Perkins for his years of leadership, 64, 80
  And we know all about that, 80, 86
And we all express our support for Tony as he deals with the aftermath of the terrible floods in Louisiana where two weeks ago I spent some time and I saw some incredible incredible people, 86, 121
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you! MR, 121, 126
TRUMP: Thank you, 126, 129
  Amazing amazing group, 129, 132
"One of the greatest privileges of my journey has been the time Ive spent with the evangelical community, 132, 150
And the support they gave me in those primaries was absolutely incredible I have to tell you, 150, 167
"  All across the nation, 167, 172
A lot of people said: I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals, 172, 185
I got the evangelicals, 185, 189
 " Im going to make it up to you too you watch, 189, 201
There are no more decent devoted or selfless people than our Christians brothers and sisters here in the United States, 201, 221
"  "True, 221, 223
So true, 223, 225
Ive witnessed that incredible generosity all across this land gotten to know so many people, 225, 240
I saw it during my trip to Louisiana where Christian volunteers raced to help their fellow citizens in need, 240, 259
Franklin Graham is an example, 259, 264
He brought the most incredible people and equipment to Louisiana, 264, 274
" " And he didnt want anything for it, 274, 283
Hes a great man, 283, 287
Its that spirit of giving that we will need to rebuild Louisiana and to rebuild this country which is in serious serious trouble, 287, 310
"  "Yet our media culture often mocks and demeans people of faith, 310, 322
And you understand that, 322, 326
All the time I hear from concerned parents how much harder it is for a Christian family to raise their children in todays media environment." AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right! "MR, 326, 355
TRUMP: It is right isnt it? "  Yeah it is right, 355, 366
  Not even close, 366, 369
Your values of love charity and faith built this nation, 369, 379
  So how can it be that our media treats people of faith so poorly? One of the reasons is that our politicians have really abandoned you to a large extent, 379, 409
And Hillary Clinton you can forget about her, 409, 417
  "So let me say this right up front: A Trump administration our Christian heritage will be cherished protected defended like youve never seen before, 417, 441
"  Believe me, 441, 444
I believe it, 444, 447
And you believe it, 447, 451
And you know it, 451, 455
You know it, 455, 458
And that includes religious liberty – remember remember, 458, 466
 " I recently had a chance to visit a church in Detroit Great Faith Ministries International, 466, 482
Stand up if youre member, 482, 487
Thats good, 487, 489
That was a great – that was an amazing experience, 489, 499
"  And the bishop what a great guy, 499, 507
In my remarks I spoke about how African American church – and this is all across the country – for centuries have been the conscience of our nation, 507, 535
Their unbreakable faith and sprit overcame some of the most difficult periods in our history leading us all to a better future, 535, 557
Very true, 557, 559
Amazing, 559, 560
This was such an amazing experience, 560, 566
 " This is the power of faith, 566, 573
Its the power to heal, 573, 578
Its the power to unite, 578, 583
Its the power to make all of us live better lives – all of us, 583, 598
"  "Our nation today is divided, 598, 604
Nobody likes to say it but were living in a very very divided nation, 604, 618
It will be our faith in God and his teachings in each other that will lead us back to unity, 618, 638
"  "Each of us here today has a role to play in bringing our country together united in common purpose and in common values, 638, 662
So lets talk today about some of the things – and these are great things – that we can do together to create the American future for everybody not just a certain group of people but for everybody." "The first thing we have to do is give our churches their voice back, 662, 714
Its been taken away, 714, 718
" " The Johnson amendment has blocked our pastors and ministers and others from speaking their minds from their own pulpits, 718, 739
If they want to talk about Christianity if they want to preach if they want to talk about politics theyre unable to do so, 739, 763
If they want to do it they take a tremendous risk that they lose their tax-exempt status." All religious leaders should be able to freely express their thoughts and feelings –   – on religious matters, 763, 798
And I will repeal the Johnson amendment –   – if I am elected your president I promise, 798, 815
  So important, 815, 817
"Thank you, 817, 819
Thats so important." And I must tell you from the heart this started a building of mine in Manhattan, 819, 838
I had 50 pastors in a big conference room, 838, 847
And we actually had 50 pastors two rabbis a couple of priests, 847, 859
We were all talking, 859, 863
And we were there for two hours, 863, 870
And at the end it was a love-fest, 870, 878
We all agreed, 878, 881
It was like a love-fest, 881, 886
"And I said to them – we were high up in a building on 5th Avenue – and I said to them Id love your support, 886, 912
And I know when I can get support, 912, 920
Im quite sophisticated, 920, 923
" " And I know they wanted to give me their total support 100 percent just like I had in the primaries, 923, 945
And I said I really would like your support, 945, 954
And they didnt really know what I was talking about, 954, 964
And I said whats going on here? They said well sir we cant do that because we would be violating the laws, 964, 986
And I said whats the punishment? Well we could lose our tax-exempt status which of course is a you know massive penalty." I said tell me about this, 986, 1014
And we sat down, 1014, 1018
They talked about it, 1018, 1022
When did it happen? 1954 or so, 1022, 1029
Lyndon Johnson was having problems – powerful guy, 1029, 1037
I actually as just own way – you have to gain respect for what he was able to do, 1037, 1056
Can you imagine that this man single-handedly – he was having problems with churches, 1056, 1070
And there was a church in Houston that was giving him a hard time maybe for very good reason, 1070, 1089
And he put in an amendment that basically stopped our great pastors and ministers and others from talking under the penalty of losing their tax-exempt status, 1089, 1115
"So we were looking down onto the sidewalk and there were people walking on the sidewalk, 1115, 1131
And I said so folks what youre telling me is those people walking way way down there on the sidewalk have really more power than you do because theyre allowed to express their feelings and thoughts openly and without penalty, 1131, 1171
And one of the pastors who I knew very well – and these are powerful people; these are strong people with magnificent voices and just – and magnificent hearts much more importantly – they looked at me and they said thats actually right, 1171, 1214
They have more power than we do, 1214, 1221
Were not allowed to express." "And thats what I said, 1221, 1231
We have to start thinking about this, 1231, 1238
And I thought about it, 1238, 1243
And then we had a large group of pastors again, 1243, 1253
I said I have thought about it, 1253, 1260
If I become president we are going to knock out the Johnson amendment, 1260, 1273
We are going to do that, 1273, 1279
And its not going to be hard, 1279, 1286
Its not going to be hard, 1286, 1292
"  "When you – when you think from the standpoint of political you have more than men – lets say men are 50 percent women are 50 percent, 1292, 1320
Youre much more than 50 percent added together, 1320, 1328
And I actually believe thats one of the reasons why you havent seen Christianity and other religions within the United States going like a rocket ship – like our polls have been going in the last four weeks a rocket ship right? " " I really believe that because youre great people, 1328, 1380
The people that you rely on on Sunday and all during the week theyve been stopped from talking and speaking by a law, 1380, 1403
And were going to get rid of that law and its going to get rid of – were going to get rid of it so fast." "And Im so proud to say – honestly I dont want to take credit but you had 50 people in that first meeting and many more in the second, 1403, 1458
I am so proud – I was just telling this to Tony – to say that was my idea, 1458, 1477
I figure its the only way Im getting to heaven so this is going to be very – "  – the only way, 1477, 1500
 " So were going to get rid of it and were going to let your great people speak and youre going to see something happen thats going to be very very good OK? So important." "I hope – which means you have to get out and vote on November 8th, 1500, 1550
You cannot – you didnt vote four years ago, 1550, 1559
You didnt vote." AUDIENCE MEMBER: I did, 1559, 1566
MR, 1566, 1567
TRUMP: You did? Well you did, 1567, 1573
A few of you did, 1573, 1578
 " Believe me I know, 1578, 1583
I look at the stats, 1583, 1588
You didnt vote, 1588, 1591
But this time you really have – and this is your last chance, 1591, 1604
This is it, 1604, 1607
I mean well never have this opportunity again, 1607, 1615
So I hope you can get every one of your friends and just get up – your family and your friends and get out and vote OK? November 8th, 1615, 1644
"  Thank you, 1644, 1647
 " And if you do were going to win by a lot, 1647, 1659
Thats not going to even be a close election, 1659, 1668
And if you dont could be a very unhappy November 8th." "Were also going to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – " " – which gives the government control over the lives of everyday citizens, 1668, 1703
And the numbers are horrendous, 1703, 1708
Your premiums are going up by 50 60 70 percent, 1708, 1718
The deductible is so high you never get to use it unless you are going to lead a very long and very complex bad period – very very long, 1718, 1747
It is a disaster, 1747, 1751
Its a disaster and everybody knows it, 1751, 1758
And its going to die of its own weight anyway but were going to get rid of it and were going to replace it with some great great alternatives – much better health care at a much lower price, 1758, 1797
"  "Hillary Clinton wants to have completely government-run health care which would be a disaster for the liberties and freedoms of all America, 1797, 1820
Thats what she wants, 1820, 1824
Thats what shes aiming at, 1824, 1829
Thats what Obama wanted, 1829, 1833
He didnt quite get there but he got this and you see how bad this has been." One of the biggest issues in this race is going to be the issue of school choice, 1833, 1867
 " And I cant possibly emphasize this enough, 1867, 1875
Millions of poor and disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools, 1875, 1886
This education crisis afflicts all communities but none more so than the African-American community – none, 1886, 1902
The Democratic Party has run the inner cities of America for 50 60 70 years some cases over a hundred years – over a hundred years, 1902, 1928
Their policies and their politics and in particular the politics of people like Hillary Clinton have produced only poverty joblessness and rising crime." "When she was running for the Senate in New York State she said she was going to produce jobs jobs jobs in Upstate New York, 1928, 1976
Its a disaster, 1976, 1979
Shes going to produce jobs big thing – jobs were going to bring back jobs, 1979, 1994
Been a catastrophe, 1994, 1997
Weve lost tens of thousands of jobs, 1997, 2004
She never did a thing, 2004, 2009
It was all talk no action just like what shes doing right now is all talk no action, 2009, 2027
Shell talk and talk and nothing will happen, 2027, 2035
Only bad will happen, 2035, 2039
But you just have to ask the people in Upstate New York, 2039, 2051
She won because of them and she produced absolutely nothing, 2051, 2061
Jobs left, 2061, 2063
Its today one of the worst one of the most depressing places in this country, 2063, 2078
So just remember that when you hear her talking about jobs, 2078, 2089
I know jobs, 2089, 2092
She doesnt know jobs, 2092, 2096
That I can tell you, 2096, 2101
"  I have outlined a new civil rights agenda for our time – the right to a safe community a great education and a secure job, 2101, 2127
  "And I say to African-American parents I say to Hispanic American parents – and I say it with great respect – our inner cities are a disaster – crime no jobs education is the worst in many cases almost worldwide bad and in many cases actually worldwide bad, 2127, 2175
I say with great respect what do you have to lose? It cant get any worse, 2175, 2191
It cant get any worse, 2191, 2196
You choose Donald Trump Im going to fix the problem, 2196, 2206
Youre going to have safety, 2206, 2211
" " Youre going to have good education, 2211, 2219
Were going to get jobs because were going to bring our jobs back, 2219, 2232
Mexicos taking our jobs, 2232, 2236
So many other places theyre taking our jobs, 2236, 2244
What Chinas doing to us is horrible, 2244, 2251
Were going to have jobs, 2251, 2256
What do you have to lose? Im going to fix this, 2256, 2267
Im going to fix it, 2267, 2272
"  School choice is at the center of this civil rights agenda and my goal is to provide every single inner-city child in America that is trapped in a failing government school the freedom to attend the school of their choice, 2272, 2313
Competition – the schools the schools will get better and better and better, 2313, 2326
  And that means a private school a religious school a charter school or a magnet school, 2326, 2342
School choice also means that parents can home-school their children, 2342, 2352
  Hundred percent, 2352, 2354
Hillary Clinton opposes school choice because she is controlled totally totally like a puppet by special interests, 2354, 2371
Her policies will force millions of African-American and Hispanic children to remain stuck in failed government schools leading to higher unemployment and more poverty, 2371, 2395
The poverty levels in this country nobody will believe nobody will believe, 2395, 2407
My plan will break the government monopoly and make schools compete to provide the best services for our children –   – including every African-American and Hispanic child in this country every single one of them, 2407, 2442
  This proposal begins with a $20 billion block grant from the federal government for states to pursue school choice programs, 2442, 2462
 " However – thats good right? "  However because 90 percent of education spending is at the state level I will campaign to get the states to reallocate another $110 billion of their education budgets to school choice programs, 2462, 2501
  "If we do this that would mean $12000 in school choice funds for every disadvantaged student in America, 2501, 2519
What a difference this is going to make, 2519, 2527
The money will follow the student to the public private or religious school that is best for them and their family, 2527, 2548
In so many ways youre going to have choice." My administration will partner with the leadership of any inner-city – anybody – anybody in the inner cities of America willing to run a pilot program – and there will be a lot of them – to provide school choice to every child in that community, 2548, 2603
In Baltimore for instance that would mean more than $15000 in funds available per student, 2603, 2618
"As your president I will be the biggest cheerleader for school choice youve ever seen, 2618, 2633
" " This means a lot to me because I know it can turn things around, 2633, 2649
Again the education cant get worse, 2649, 2655
Commo Core – were going to end it, 2655, 2663
" " Were bringing education local." "I will fight for every child in this country who deserve better futures, 2663, 2682
The African-American community has heard my message that I am going to make the inner city safe again and Im going to bring back jobs and Im going to bring back the great education, 2682, 2716
Dont be surprised – remember this November 8th – dont be surprised because we have been given a lot of support over the last three or four weeks if on November 8th I get more African-American and Hispanic votes than anyone thought possible about a month ago, 2716, 2763
You see whats going on? "  "Theyre starting – people are starting to hear about this, 2763, 2779
And theyre saying wow, 2779, 2783
Wow, 2783, 2784
Theyre liking it, 2784, 2787
And again cant get any worse, 2787, 2793
Its going to get a lot better, 2793, 2800
But only if I do it, 2800, 2806
They cant do it, 2806, 2810
The Democrats they have – what theyve done is incredible, 2810, 2820
And Hillary Clinton will be absolutely more of the same – rigid, 2820, 2832
Itll never change, 2832, 2835
Remember a hundred years 70 years 50 – its not going to change, 2835, 2848
Not going to happen." "Now lets talk about another issue that will define the future of this country for generations to come the United States Supreme Court, 2848, 2875
"  Earlier this year we lost the great justice Antonin Scalia, 2875, 2886
The next president will not only have to fill this seat but as many as four others, 2886, 2903
It could even be – I mean we could end up with a total of five judges by one president, 2903, 2923
It would be record-setting, 2923, 2927
Probably be three, 2927, 2930
Could be four, 2930, 2933
Could even be five, 2933, 2937
And you pick the wrong people you have a country that is no longer your country, 2937, 2953
It will be a disaster, 2953, 2958
"One of the most important issues frankly – other than maybe defense because were going to build up our military its so depleted, 2958, 2981
" " Were going to take care of our vets, 2981, 2991
Were going to protect your Second Amendment so many things, 2991, 3001
But one of the most important – some people think its actually the most important – is the filling of the seats United States Supreme Court, 3001, 3027
You see whats happening right now? Essentially its four and four, 3027, 3038
And you see what – how bad it is, 3038, 3047
Were going to pick great judges, 3047, 3053
Ive already put a list of 11 Federalist Society highly recommended got uniform great reviews on these 11 people, 3053, 3072
And we are going to put truly great people, 3072, 3081
Maybe we use Judge Scalia of the ultimate example of what were looking for OK? "  "This will determine whether or not we remain a constitutional republic frankly, 3081, 3109
Thats whats going to happen, 3109, 3114
I have pledged to appoint judges who uphold the Constitution to protect your religious liberty and apply the law as written, 3114, 3135
" " We reject judges who rewrite the Constitution to impose their own person views on 300 million-plus Americans, 3135, 3154
Were not going to have that, 3154, 3160
Ive made public a list of judges as I said that will guide my selection process, 3160, 3176
Hillary Clinton has refused to provide such a list, 3176, 3185
And we brought it up." "Lets see a list, 3185, 3194
You ever saw the list you would walk out of here not feeling very well, 3194, 3209
" " Because she knows the extremist judges she would pick would be rejected by the overwhelming majority of the American public, 3209, 3231
Theyd be rejected, 3231, 3234
Clintons judicial picks would allow her to completely take over American health care the American economy and Americans religious liberty – not to mention your Second Amendment which is on very thin ice right now as you know because of the fact that were at four-and-four, 3234, 3280
If they even pick one judge whos wrong you can probably – as you know it – you can kiss the Second Amendment goodbye, 3280, 3304
And we dont want to see that." "Another issue in this race of great importance to everyone in this room is the issue of course of national security, 3304, 3332
Just today it was announced that North Korea performed its fifth nuclear test – its fourth since Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, 3332, 3355
Its just one more massive failure from a failed secretary of state, 3355, 3367
" " Failed at everything, 3367, 3372
Her policies have also put Iran onto a path of nuclear weapons and I have to say made them overnight an absolute power, 3372, 3395
They were dying three years ago, 3395, 3401
The sanctions were choking them, 3401, 3406
They would have fallen, 3406, 3410
But Obama didnt support people that would have taken over and I think in this case probably would have taken over the right way; had no support." "But you look at whats happened to Iran in such a short period of time, 3410, 3452
But remember the ransom payments, 3452, 3457
Remember it was $400 million two weeks ago, 3457, 3465
But then they made a mistake, 3465, 3471
This is cash, 3471, 3474
Remember they said they paid cash because they couldnt open a bank account, 3474, 3487
There was no way of sending it into a checking account, 3487, 3498
" " All lies just like Obamacare was a big lie remember? You can use your plan, 3498, 3515
You can use your doctors – 27 times right? Twenty-seven times, 3515, 3526
You can use your doctors use your plan; turned out to be a lie, 3526, 3540
Its all a lie, 3540, 3544
Its all a big lie, 3544, 3549
Its a rigged system and its a lie." "And Ill tell you what, 3549, 3562
Ill tell you what, 3562, 3566
The 400 million (dollars) for those that havent been reading the papers over the last two days turned out to be 1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – cash, 3566, 3594
And I actually said – they said oh that moneys going to be used for terror, 3594, 3610
I said no they dont need it for terror, 3610, 3619
Theyve got 150 billion (dollars), 3619, 3624
Thats in addition to the $150 billion that were giving back, 3624, 3635
I said they dont need it, 3635, 3641
This is going into their Swiss accounts and going into their accounts, 3641, 3653
Theyre not going to use it for terror, 3653, 3661
They have plenty of money for terror." "Think of it – $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash – massive big vats of cash, 3661, 3683
You saw them – cartons, 3683, 3688
I never saw anything like it, 3688, 3694
Ive seen a lot of cash, 3694, 3700
" " Hey never saw anything like this – $1.7 billion (dollars), 3700, 3712
Can you imagine these guys? Planes get – they stop, 3712, 3722
Remember they wouldnt give back the hostages, 3722, 3729
They waited there for hours and hours, 3729, 3736
And Obama kept saying no no this has nothing to do – even the hostages said they kept us waiting for a certain plane to come in not to take them back because they were waiting for something, 3736, 3774
It was this – just another lie." "But can you imagine these people sitting there and they see $1.7 billion (dollars) in cash? Ai yai yai, 3774, 3800
They think were stupid, 3800, 3804
" " They think were stupid, 3804, 3810
They wont be thinking it for long, 3810, 3817
"  Very sad, 3817, 3820
  "At the same time ISIS is hunting down and exterminating what it calls the nation of the cross, 3820, 3838
ISIS is carrying out a genocide against Christians in the Middle East, 3838, 3850
We cannot let this evil continue – can t let it, 3850, 3861
"  ISIS must be destroyed – have to; have no choice, 3861, 3872
"To defeat ISIS we must use military warfare but also cyber warfare financial warfare and ideological warfare, 3872, 3889
Its a whole different ballgame today than it was 50 years ago and 200 years ago – different world." We must also establish a bipartisan goal in the United States and an international goal with our allies of defeating radical Islamic terrorism –  " – words that our president wont use and words that Hillary Clinton wont use, 3889, 3947
Just like we won the Cold War by identifying our enemy and building a consensus to guide a long-term strategy so too must we do the same with Islamic terrorism." "By the way President Obama has allowed Syrian refugees to pour into our country at unbelievable rates, 3947, 3994
And Hillary Clinton wants to allow 550 percent more, 3994, 4003
But its almost impossible to get a Christian in from Syria, 4003, 4014
They take others but they dont take Christians – very very very rare." "So I said that we need to make safe zones in the region, 4014, 4040
We want to take care of people, 4040, 4047
But we absolutely cannot allow this potential tremendous threat to continue and we have to stop this, 4047, 4064
This is going to be potentially a catastrophe for our country, 4064, 4075
Its from within, 4075, 4078
This could be the all-time great Trojan horse, 4078, 4086
This could be it." You ever notice on the – you look at the migration trail and you see people with cellphones, 4086, 4108
Cellphones, 4108, 4109
And some of the cellphones have the ISIS flag printed on them, 4109, 4121
And some of them have things far worse than that – scenes far worse than that, 4121, 4137
"So it was the failed policies you have to remember of Hillary Clinton and Obama that unleashed ISIS in the first place, 4137, 4159
If they did the right thing you wouldnt be talking about ISIS right now, 4159, 4173
" " Now she wants to get rid of – oh were going to get rid of them, 4173, 4191
You know she tells them already there will be no boots on the ground, 4191, 4205
Now even if you dont want boots on the ground you dont want to say it, 4205, 4221
Dont say it! Now theyre saying oh I hope she wins, 4221, 4232
Oh boy would they dream of having her as president, 4232, 4242
Can you – " " – they dream about it every night having Hillary Clinton, 4242, 4257
But even if you believe – and I can understand that, 4257, 4268
No boots on the ground I can understand, 4268, 4276
You dont say it! Let them think theyre going to go through hell, 4276, 4289
Dont say it! "  "Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur can you imagine the great General George Patton or one of our great generals that we have today – General Flynn whos here someplace – " " – I love General Flynn – but can you imagine these people saying – I mean theyre basically giving out the strategy: there will be no boots on the ground, 4289, 4358
If you dont want that I fully understand, 4358, 4366
Dont say it! Dont say it! Could you imagine MacArthur saying were going to fight the enemy and were going to move our troops in in about a month were going to hit from behind? " " Were going to hit them from the front then – and everything they say turns out to be true? You know I hate to say this because we have a lot of Evangelicals in this room but maybe we shouldnt be so honest when it comes to military strategy, 4366, 4452
Does that make sense? " " Hope I didnt lose your vote for saying that, 4452, 4467
"  "Just look at what her policies have left us with in Iraq Syria and Libya, 4467, 4483
The problem is Hillary Clinton is trigger-happy, 4483, 4490
She really is, 4490, 4493
Shes trigger-happy and yet she says no boots which is sort of – probably will be boots you know, 4493, 4512
Probably will turn out to be another disaster, 4512, 4520
He tenure has brought us only war and destruction and death, 4520, 4531
Shes just too quick to intervene invade or to push for regime change with people we dont even know who they are, 4531, 4553
And they take over and theyre far worse, 4553, 4561
This creates the power vacuums that are filled by terrorist and groups like ISIS." "My administration on the other hand will work with any country that is willing to partner with us to defeat ISIS and halt radical Islamic terrorism, 4561, 4601
And by the way that includes Russia, 4601, 4608
If they want to join us on knocking out ISIS that is just fine as far as Im concerned, 4608, 4627
" " Its a very imperfect world and you cant always choose your friends, 4627, 4641
Thats life." "But you can never fail to recognize your enemies, 4641, 4652
We have some real enemies, 4652, 4657
Unfortunately for our country our enemies probably hacked into Hillary Clintons emails, 4657, 4669
These are the same emails she destroyed after receiving a federal subpoena, 4669, 4681
Whats that? Using software in order to bleach the emails so you can never ever see them, 4681, 4698
She even mysteriously lost 13 different phones before the FBI got them and many were destroyed with a hammer, 4698, 4717
"  Did anybody ever hit a hammer – you know maybe two or three people but they were just released from prison those two people, 4717, 4742
  Can you believe this? Destroyed them with a hammer – the old-fashioned way I guess, 4742, 4757
  The other night in the Commander in Chief Forum – did anybody see that?   How did I do?  " Good, 4757, 4777
Well we have a big debate coming up, 4777, 4785
Who knows whats going to happen there? But I will say every poll has me winning big league at the Commander in Chief, 4785, 4808
" " We had – the polls came out after that event and we won big league, 4808, 4825
Now we have a debate coming up, 4825, 4832
I dont imagine any of you going to be watching the debate right? "  "AUDIENCE MEMBER: Dont take her bait, 4832, 4852
Dont take her bait." "MR, 4852, 4857
TRUMP: I wont; I promise, 4857, 4862
Hillary Clinton answered questions on her emails horribly, 4862, 4870
Thats why she lost, 4870, 4874
Thats why she did so poorly, 4874, 4880
She was terrible, 4880, 4883
She was – honestly I shouldnt be saying this – she was terrible, 4883, 4896
"  She keeps talking about the emails, 4896, 4903
Every time she talks about them she talks about them differently, 4903, 4914
 " It seems each week true she has like a different answer, 4914, 4926
But there can be no answer when she deletes 33000 emails bleaches them so they can never be recovered – an unheard-of practice – hammers them into total silence, 4926, 4955
You know what happening, 4955, 4959
You know whats happening." I always say getting away with that will be the single greatest accomplishment of her career, 4959, 4979
 " Its true, 4979, 4982
Its true, 4982, 4984
"  So her answers were bad, 4984, 4990
They were bad, 4990, 4993
And a lot of people said they were so totally dishonest, 4993, 5004
And you know she was blaming Matt Lauer, 5004, 5012
I thought Matt Lauer did a very good job, 5012, 5021
I mean his questions to me were very tough, 5021, 5030
  But the gentleman who stood up and said: Honestly you should be in prison for what you did –   – to me that was the tough one, 5030, 5057
  That was the tough – hey that was a tough question, 5057, 5068
  It was sort of a question in the form of a statement right?   Hillary Clinton is unfit to be our president for many reasons, 5068, 5092
  True, 5092, 5093
True, 5093, 5094
 " Shes unfit for many reasons the biggest of which is her judgement, 5094, 5107
Its just so bad, 5107, 5111
" " Its time to restore honestly and integrity to our government, 5111, 5123
"  Have to do it, 5123, 5128
And one more issue finally issue I want to discuss today is the economy and helping those in need, 5128, 5147
There is no more charitable group in this country than Christians, 5147, 5158
  And all of us through – and all of us here today are determined to lift suffering Americans out of poverty, 5158, 5179
Going to do it with a lot of other people going to help, 5179, 5192
As you president I will pursue a complete reform of our economy to bring back millions of new jobs into our country – millions of new jobs, 5192, 5219
 " Weve lost our jobs like were a bunch of babies, 5219, 5230
Theyve gone to other countries, 5230, 5235
Theyve gone to Mexico, 5235, 5239
Theyve gone to many other countries, 5239, 5245
Chinas taking massive advantage of us, 5245, 5251
Its all so easy believe me, 5251, 5257
Its all so easy." That includes we will be doing massive tax cuts for working families and for businesses, 5257, 5276
  It includes very importantly the elimination of all needless job-killing regulations, 5276, 5287
  It includes lifting the restrictions on American energy which is under siege, 5287, 5299
 " I will also renegotiate NAFTA, 5299, 5305
And if they dont want to renegotiate it so it becomes a two-way highway not just a one-way highway out of the United States for our companies and our jobs we will terminate NAFTA believe me, 5305, 5341
" " Well stand up to China and were going to fight for every last job, 5341, 5357
Its going to be America first and its going to be the American worker first, 5357, 5372
"  Crucially I will also fight for the American family and American family values, 5372, 5386
The family must be at the center of any anti-poverty agenda, 5386, 5397
Has to be, 5397, 5400
  Thank you, 5400, 5402
Our country just lost one of the great champions for the American family Phyllis Schlafly, 5402, 5417
Great woman really great woman, 5417, 5422
  We send our thoughts and prayers to her loved ones, 5422, 5432
I will be going to her funeral tomorrow in St, 5432, 5442
Louis, 5442, 5443
  "Phyllis fought very hard to the very end for a free and prosperous America, 5443, 5457
She understood that to be truly united as a country we cant simply turn to government or to politicians, 5457, 5476
The bedrock of our unity is the realization that we are all brothers and sisters created by the same God, 5476, 5496
Phyllis understood that, 5496, 5499
"  Phyllis understood that, 5499, 5503
"And by the way Phyllis endorsed me a long time ago when it wasnt necessarily – " " – something that was so easy to do, 5503, 5529
And she was incredible, 5529, 5533
She was so brave, 5533, 5537
She endorsed me and that was not the thing to do at the time, 5537, 5551
People said Trump? She said hes going to win you dont understand, 5551, 5563
He knows how to win, 5563, 5568
Hes going to win, 5568, 5572
" " They said Phyllis not going to be Trump, 5572, 5582
And we went boom boom boom, 5582, 5588
But I will tell you Phyllis endorsed me at a time when it wasnt necessarily the thing to do even the popular thing to do and I will never forget that, 5588, 5619
That had a huge impact, 5619, 5624
She was a great great powerful woman with a tremendous heart, 5624, 5635
And I look forward to being with her family tomorrow because you really – thats a celebration, 5635, 5652
She was 92 years old, 5652, 5657
"  "We are all equal and we all come from the same Creator, 5657, 5670
If we remember that simple fact then our future is truly limitless, 5670, 5682
There is nothing we as Americans cant do." Theres a biblical verse that I have often read and I want to repeat it again because I think it is so important to what were trying to achieve right now for our country, 5682, 5724
Its from 1 John Chapter 4: "No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another God lives in us and His love is made complete in us." AUDIENCE MEMBER: Amen, 5724, 5757
MR, 5757, 5758
TRUMP: So true, 5758, 5761
  So true, 5761, 5763
  Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as one people under one God saluting one flag, 5763, 5783
 " Its time to stop quibbling over the smallest words and time to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead for our country." "This is my promise to all of you: starting in 2017 we will be one American nation, 5783, 5825
Its time to break our ties with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new American future, 5825, 5845
Have to do it, 5845, 5849
Together we will make America believe again we will make America united again and we will make America great again, 5849, 5869
Thank you very much and God bless you, 5869, 5877
Thank you, 5877, 5879

Thank you very much, 5882, 5886
