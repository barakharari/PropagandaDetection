This is such an amazing city, 0, 6
Its called "Home of the Heroes" because of your proud tradition of military service, 6, 20
Pueblo is home to Four Medal of Honor Recipients, 20, 29
As President Eisenhower said there must be "something in the water out there in Pueblo" because "all you guys turn out to be heroes." Colorado is home to six military bases, 29, 60
We are going to eliminate the defense sequester and rebuild our military, 60, 72
Another great Colorado legacy is hunting and fishing, 72, 80
We are going to conserve your land for future generations and we are going to save the 2nd amendment, 80, 99
One other issue of such great importance in Colorado is energy, 99, 110
Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the mines and shut down shale oil and natural gas, 110, 126
We are going to end the war on American energy and we are going to put the miners back to work, 126, 147
I have also made a center piece of my economic revitalization plan the largest middle class tax cut since Ronald Reagan –and the largest regulatory reform in American history, 147, 176
That is because I know how overtaxed and overregulated the working people of this country are, 176, 192
A central issue I would like to address today is our broken tax code an issue of concern to all Americans, 192, 213
"Along with securing our borders rebuilding our military keeping us safe from terrorism redoing our trade deals and bringing back jobs fixing the tax code is one of the main reasons Im running for President." "Ive been saying from the beginning of this campaign how ridiculous complex and yes unfair our tax system is, 213, 267
This is not the fault of the IRS but the political class that is owned outright by the special interests and lobbyists." It is these politicians who wrote the tax code and who are constantly adding revising and changing an already over-complicated set of laws – all at the behest of their favored donors and special interests, 267, 324
"Its thousands of pages long and almost no one understands it, 324, 335
The average American would need an army of accountants and lawyers to wade their way through it." "Many so-called experts due to the sheer size and complexity of the code dont have a clue what these pages represent." "The unfairness of the tax laws is unbelievable its something Ive been talking about for a long time – despite being a beneficiary." I understand the tax laws better than almost anyone which is why I am the one who can fix them – and that is what I commit to doing, 335, 425
As a businessman and real estate developer I have legally used the tax laws to my benefit and to the benefit of my company and my employees, 425, 452
I have often said on the campaign trail that I have a fiduciary responsibility to pay no more tax than legally required – or put another way to pay as little tax as legally possible, 452, 487
"As a major real estate developer in this country and throughout the world I face enormous taxes: city taxes state taxes sales and excise taxes employee taxes and federal taxes, 487, 517
Its my job to minimize the overall tax burden to the greatest extent possible – which allows me to reinvest in neighborhoods workers and build amazing properties which fuel tremendous growth in their communities – and always help our great providers of jobs the small business." "The news media is now obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990s at the end of one of the most brutal economic downturns in our countrys history." The conditions facing real estate developers in the early nineties were almost as bad as the Great Depression of 1929 and far worse than the Great Recession of 2008, 517, 621
What had been a booming economy in the era of Ronald Reagan changed dramatically – and the business landscape changed with it: Bank failures the collapse of the Savings & Loan industry and the implosion of the retail market and real estate in general, 621, 665
Many business people including many of my competitors were not able to survive, 665, 678
Companies jobs and opportunities were lost – and lives were destroyed as tens of thousands of people were put out of work, 678, 700
Some of the biggest and strongest people and companies went bankrupt, 700, 711
Yet today my company is bigger stronger with far greater assets and more premium properties than ever before, 711, 729
That did not happen by chance or luck – it happened by action and talent, 729, 744
I was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of this real estate depression when few others did, 744, 771
In those most difficult times when so many had their backs to the wall I reached within myself and delivered for my company my employees my family and the communities where my properties existed, 771, 805
Those who spend their entire lives within the confines of government work and who know virtually nothing of business fail to understand the skill dedication and sheer grit it takes for a company to climb out of an economic depression of the scale we had in the early nineties, 805, 854
People like my opponent Hillary Clinton whose only method of making money is by selling "government favors and granting access to special interests know nothing about how businesses succeed and grow, 854, 885
Hillary Clinton has never created a single job in her entire life – or added a single dollar of value to the American economy, 885, 909
Hillary Clinton hasnt made an honest dollar in her entire life – all she does is take from you from our country and peddles influence to donors special interests and foreign actors – for astronomical dollars and like never before, 909, 949
Its corruption of the highest order." While I made my money as a highly-successful private businessman following the law Hillary Clinton made her money as a corrupt public official breaking the law and putting her government office up for sale, 949, 989
By her own account Hillary Clinton left the White House dead broke and now she and her husband have made more than $200 million dollars – without building a company or creating a single thing of value, 989, 1026
During the early nineties as companies were collapsing left and right the media and powers that be said Donald Trump could never make it back, 1026, 1051
They said I had billions of dollars in borrowing and hundreds of millions in personal guarantees and no pathway out, 1051, 1071
But I never had any doubts and never gave up, 1071, 1081
"Thats because I knew in my heart that when the chips are down is when I perform at my very best, 1081, 1102
And when people make the mistake of underestimating me thats when they are in for their biggest surprise." Just look at what happened in the primary, 1102, 1128
Just look at what our incredible movement is doing right now, 1128, 1139
"The reason I never felt endangered during the real estate downturn was that I knew myself I knew my business I knew the financial system I knew the tax code and most importantly I knew how to fight, 1139, 1177
Thats what I am – a fighter and I am now going to fight for you." With my knowledge I knew that I would make a comeback in business, 1177, 1206
That is why I am here today, 1206, 1213
That is why I have left private business for public life – because I understand our country is in very bad shape, 1213, 1235
And now our country is in need of a major comeback – it needs one now more than ever, 1235, 1254
"We owe $20 trillion dollars in debt but thats only part of the story – we have over $100 trillion dollars in unfunded liabilities and we have a budget thats out of control with annual deficits, 1254, 1290
In addition because of the incompetence of our leaders we run massive trade deficits on an annual basis now almost $800 billion a year." Our country is broke, 1290, 1318
"We have decaying infrastructure failing schools rising crime a depleted military an open border and an economy that cant create full-time high-paying jobs, 1318, 1341
We are a divided nation and each week it seems we are getting more and more divided with race riots in our streets on a" monthly basis, 1341, 1368
"This is not the America that was handed down to us and its not the America we want for our children, 1368, 1389
And its certainly not the America we want to pass down to our grandchildren, 1389, 1403
But this is the America we will have if we dont turn things around – starting today." What I say is not lost on the American people because 70% of you believe our country is headed in the wrong direction, 1403, 1443
We cannot have another 4 years of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will be worse, 1443, 1458
"We can turn this all around – but not if we dont make a change in leadership RIGHT NOW, 1458, 1477
The failed political establishment must go – it must go for the sake of your country your future and those you love the most." "In the early 90s they splashed the front pages with stories about how I was finished, 1477, 1517
Everybody said that I was done – there were front page articles in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, 1517, 1538
They were thrilled and delighted to write these negative stories." "So they said I was finished, 1538, 1554
The only person who didnt think that I was in trouble was Donald Trump." I started my company with a small loan and as I grew I borrowed money to grow the company, 1554, 1587
When the bottom fell out of the Real Estate market I had all the debt it stayed the same – but the value of the assets plummeted, 1587, 1614
But I knew how to use the tax code to rebuild my company when others did not, 1614, 1631
"My understanding of the tax code gave me a big advantage over those who didnt have a clue including many of my competitors who lost everything they had never to be heard from again." "Now theyre gone and Im here and Im ready to turn things around for this country." "The early 90s was a very tough time for the world but in tough times you need tough people." These are tough times for America today and we need tough leaders, 1631, 1712
Not people who tell you what you want to hear but people who tell you what you need to hear: we must never allow corrupt career politicians like the Clintons ever back into the White House again, 1712, 1749
"These tough times were when I performed my very best, 1749, 1759
The economy and banks collapsing the government was a mess – but I enjoyed waking up every day to go to battle, 1759, 1781
I enjoyed getting up every morning to take on the financial establishment on behalf of my company and win, 1781, 1800
Thats the thinking we need for our country – thats the thinking we need when we are negotiating trade deals and military deals and economic deals on behalf of the American people." Put me into the boardroom as YOUR representative and I will deliver for you, 1800, 1846
Hillary Clinton is in it only for herself and her donors, 1846, 1857
I am here fighting for America, 1857, 1863
"Many people have said that I perform better under pressure than anyone theyve ever seen – Ive proven that over and over again." "Thats what I do, 1863, 1890
When the pressure is on when the odds are stacked against me when people say it cant be done – thats when I am just getting started." The thing that motivates me the most is when people tell me something is impossible, 1890, 1932
For me impossible is just a starting point, 1932, 1940
From the depths of that terrible real estate depression I created a company worth billions and billions of dollars and created tens of thousands of jobs, 1940, 1966
Our company and our employees remade skylines revitalized neighborhoods rejuvenated communities and hired thousands of workers, 1966, 1982
"On November 8th Americas comeback begins – and we are going to rise up from our present challenges bigger and better and stronger than ever before." The people here in Pueblo know what it takes to rebuild this country, 1982, 2021
This is a city with a rich immigrant history and a rich Latino history that has contributed so much to this country and this state, 2021, 2046
Though the people of Pueblo and their families have hailed from all regions of the world you are united by this one thing: You are all Americans, 2046, 2073
And as Americans you are entitled to the same protections as every other American, 2073, 2087
Everyone lawfully living inside of our borders are entitled to the same things: safe communities a great education and access to high-paying jobs, 2087, 2110
"This is the change I will deliver, 2110, 2117
Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and delivered nothing but failure, 2117, 2130
Her policies have brought death and destruction overseas and poverty at home, 2130, 2142
Shes brought massive poverty for everyone but especially African-American and Hispanic Citizens." She opposes school choice and wants to trap poor African-American and Hispanic children in failing government schools, 2142, 2171
We are going to get poor minority children out of failing schools and into the public private charter or magnet school of their choice, 2171, 2195
Hillary Clinton supports Obamacare and wants to expand it – Obamacare is an absolute disaster, 2195, 2210
Premiums in Colorado are set to go up another 20 percent – the only way to stop this disaster is to vote Trump, 2210, 2233
Hillary Clinton also supports the terrible trade deals like Bill Clintons NAFTA and Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization – and next she wants the Trans-Pacific Partnership the deal she calls the "Gold Standard." Colorado has lost more than 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since the NAFTA and China deals, 2233, 2284
"But while youve lost out Hillary Clinton has raked in cash from her contributors, 2284, 2298
She and Bill have made $150 million in speeches to special interests, 2298, 2310
They gave 39 speeches to Big Banks including $2 million in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs, 2310, 2326
The Clintons received another $2 million from a Swiss Bank after Hillary negotiated a favorable settlement for them as Secretary of State." "To hide her corruption Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking, 2326, 2366
Then she deleted and bleached 33000 emails – after a congressional subpoena -- to hide them from the public, 2366, 2385
She lies to Congress under oath and her ringleaders took the fifth amendment and got immunity deals, 2385, 2402
Its worse than Watergate." "The investigation of Hillary Clinton was rigged and its a shame and its one of the saddest things that have ever taken place in our nation." We have become a Banana Republic, 2402, 2438
"Now today we learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clintons top aides to DESTROY" their laptops, 2438, 2457
Let me repeat that: the FBI reportedly made a deal to DESTROY the laptops of government officials implicated in a massive criminal cover-up, 2457, 2480
Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise that has corrupted our government at the highest levels and the American people have one chance to stop it – by showing up and voting on November 8th, 2480, 2517
People have had it with the years the decades of Clinton Corruption, 2517, 2529
This is the year the American people say: Enough is Enough, 2529, 2540
The Clintons are the sordid past, 2540, 2546
We are the bright future, 2546, 2551
Now another issue I want to address today is immigration, 2551, 2561
As I mentioned Pueblo is filled with wonderful hardworking immigrants, 2561, 2571
It is these hardworking immigrants who stand to lose the most from our open borders immigration policy, 2571, 2588
Illegal immigration and broken visa programs take jobs directly from Hispanic workers living here lawfully today, 2588, 2604
Illegal immigration also brings with it massive crime and massive drugs – including a terrible heroin problem right here in Colorado, 2604, 2625
We are going to build a border wall and we are going to stop the drugs gangs and the violence from pouring into Colorado, 2625, 2649
We are going to shut down the Sanctuary Cities that have led to the preventable deaths of so many, 2649, 2668
Cases like Kate Steinle murdered in San Francisco by a 5-time deported illegal immigrant, 2668, 2682
Or cases like Sarah Root killed by an illegal immigrant released at the border by President Obama – and then released again after the killing, 2682, 2707
There are over 2 million criminal aliens in this county and we are going to get them out – and we are going to get them out quickly, 2707, 2735
To the cartels the gangs the drug dealers I have a simple message for you: your days are numbered and your reign of crime will soon come crashing to an end, 2735, 2766
We also have to keep our country safe from terrorism, 2766, 2776
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and Jersey and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington, 2776, 2811
Or look at cases like the Boston Bombers here on asylum or the San Bernardino Shooter here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia, 2811, 2835
Or the Orlando shooter the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, 2835, 2847
Terrorists are infiltrating our country, 2847, 2852
Now Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and countless more refugees from across the Middle East, 2852, 2871
I want to keep you and your family safe, 2871, 2880
My job is not to represent foreign countries, 2880, 2888
My job is to represent the citizens of the United States of America – putting your jobs your wages and your security first, 2888, 2911
If you are living in the United States today as a lawful resident or U.S, 2911, 2926
citizen I will ensure you have a safe community rising wages and secure immigration system, 2926, 2941
Immigration Security is National Security, 2941, 2946
Here are some more things we will do starting in 2017 – We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 2946, 3008
We are going to rebuild America, 3008, 3014
We are going to revitalize America, 3014, 3020
And we are going to unite America, 3020, 3027
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 3027, 3048
Together we will make America wealthy again, 3048, 3055
We will make America strong again, 3055, 3061
We will make America safe again, 3061, 3067
And we will make America great again, 3067, 3074
Thank you and God Bless! , 3074, 3079
