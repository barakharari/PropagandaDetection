My story paved the way for the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 0, 12
Together we can fulfill its promise, 12, 18
When I became an overnight shift manager at the Goodyear plant in 1979 there werent many women on the job (and the few there were didnt stay long), 18, 46
But I worked my way up and in 1996 I even received the plants "top performance award." "It wasnt until 19 years after Id started that I learned I was being paid less than my male colleagues." One evening I came into work early checked my mail and there it was: an anonymous note that listed my salary and the salaries of three men with the same title, 46, 114
I was being paid significantly less for the same job—less than I deserved and less than my family needed, 114, 133
"The easiest thing to do would have been to let it go, 133, 145
But thats not who I am." I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court, 145, 162
But they ruled that though I had clearly been discriminated against I had filed my case too late to be compensated, 162, 183
Seven years ago today President Obama signed his first bill into law: the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which makes it easier to challenge wage discrimination in court, 183, 211
It was an important step toward equal pay for women and an important victory for the increasing number of American households where women are the primary breadwinner, 211, 238
Under this law no one else will ever have to accept the gender discrimination I faced without the chance to challenge it in court, 238, 262
"But this isnt just my story, 262, 268
Its the story of women working full time across this country who despite new protections are on average still earning just 78 cents for every dollar a man earns—with women of color often being shortchanged even more, 268, 305
Thats money their families are losing out on." "Our next president can either build on the progress weve made and go even further—or dismiss this important issue, 305, 332
Women across this country need more than rhetoric; they need action—they need a fighter in the White House." I firmly believe Hillary Clinton will be that fighter, 332, 359
"Hillary has spent decades fighting to advance womens rights and economic opportunities, 359, 371
We fought side by side to pass the Lilly Ledbetter Act which she co-sponsored in the United States Senate and she has been a tireless champion for the Paycheck Fairness Act—legislation that would go even further to address the pay gap, 371, 412
And shes put issues like equal pay affordable child care paid leave and reproductive rights front and center in her campaign." Hillary understands that these issues cant be dismissed or pushed to the sidelines, 412, 446
Theyre not just "social issues"—theyre fundamental to our countrys economic future and they are at the heart of everything shes fighting for on this campaign, 446, 471
For Hillary this is about more than politics—its personal, 471, 480
She just gets it plain and simple, 480, 487
"Of all the candidates in this race she is the one we can count on to be a fierce and uncompromising champion for women for basic fairness and for opportunity for everyone, 487, 519
Shes not just a steadfast supporter of issues that affect womens lives; shes someone who has been there, 519, 537
She doesnt just say the right things; she does the right things, 537, 549
And when it comes to finally closing the gender pay gap once and for all that will make a world of difference." , 549, 571
