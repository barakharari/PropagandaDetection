Thank you, 0, 2
In 19 days we are going to win the state of Ohio and we are going to win the White House, 2, 23
Early voting is underway so make sure to mail in your ballot or vote in-person, 23, 38
Ladies and Gentlemen I want to make a major announcement today, 38, 49
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic Presidential election – if I win! ALTERNATE: Ladies and Gentlemen I want to make a major announcement today, 49, 103
I would like to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters and to all of the people of the United States that when the results come in on election night I will accept – without delay or hesitation – the concession speech of Hillary Rodham Clinton, 103, 152
Now seriously the debate last night was amazing and everybody said I won including every single online poll some by 90-10, 152, 173
The question of voter fraud came up during the debate, 173, 183
We want fairness in the election having nothing to do with me and having to do with the future of the country, 183, 205
"John Podesta Hillarys Campaign Chairman was quoted in WikiLeaks as saying illegal immigrants could vote as long as they have Drivers Licenses." One of the big issues that came up last night was the fact that the Clinton Campaign has paid people to disrupt our rallies and incite violence, 205, 254
This is criminal behavior that violates centuries of tradition on peaceful Democratic elections, 254, 267
"A campaign like Clintons that will incite violence is truly a campaign that will do anything." And a candidate like Hillary Clinton who will lie to the Congress and the FBI destroy 33000 emails put her office up for sale and put our confidential information in reach of our enemies – is a candidate who is truly capable of anything, 267, 327
"In addition it was just learned Hillary was given the exact debate questions word for word by Donna Brazile – who is now under tremendous pressure to resign, 327, 355
But I ask you why shouldnt Hillary Clinton resign from the race – she was given the questions used the questions and never said that she did something that was totally inappropriate?" Years ago there was a show called the $64000 question – he got the questions in advance his life was ruined, 355, 408
This is even bigger because we are playing for the presidency of the United States, 408, 423
Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency, 423, 438
"So its in that context I was asked a question about whether I would agree in advance to concede the results on election night, 438, 462
This is an unprecedented question, 462, 467
If Al Gore or George Bush had agreed 3 weeks before the election to concede the results and waive their right to a legal challenge or a recount then there would be no Supreme Court case and no Bush V, 467, 507
Gore." "In effect Im being asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the franchise of voters." According to Pew there are 24 million voter registrations in the United States that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate, 507, 546
1.8 million dead people are registered to vote (some of whom vote even though they are dead – which is a hard thing to do but easy if fraud is involved), 546, 577
2.8 million people are registered in more than one state, 577, 587
And 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote, 587, 595
"So what Im saying is we have to be vigilant and we have to be careful." America is a Constitutional Republic with a system of laws, 595, 621
These laws are triggered in the case of fraud or in the event a recount is needed, 621, 638
Of course I would accept a clear election result but I would also reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result, 638, 668
I will follow and abide by all of the rules and traditions of all the candidates who came before me, 668, 688
But none of this will matter since we are going to win big on November 8th, 688, 704
Together we are going to deliver real change that puts America First, 704, 716
We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees reduce surging crime cut taxes and regulations unleash job-producing American energy rebuild our military and take care of our Vets and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare, 716, 763
"Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration, 763, 772
Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration, 772, 781
Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration, 781, 791
Your companies wont be leaving Ohio under a Trump Administration." "Right now our economy isnt growing at all, 791, 809
Im going to get us to 4% growth and create 25 million jobs over 10 years." Many workers are earning less today than they were 18 years ago they are working harder and longer but making less, 809, 846
Some of them are working two three jobs but still taking home less money, 846, 860
"Companies like Carrier are firing their workers and moving to Mexico, 860, 871
Ford is moving all of its small car production to Mexico, 871, 882
When Im President if companies want to fire their workers and leave for Mexico then we will charge them a 35% tax when they want to ship their products back in, 882, 913
That means the companies wont leave in the first place and if they do well at least make money when they ship their products across the border." "Right now our politicians dont do anything to keep our companies from leaving because they are controlled by lobbyists and special interests – Hillary Clinton has raised countless millions of dollars from big donors who want to ship our jobs to other countries." That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again, 913, 1001
"Its time to drain the swamp of corruption in Washington D.C." Those reforms include the following: A 5 year-ban on executive branch and congressional officials lobbying the government after they leave government service, 1001, 1034
A lifetime ban on former executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government, 1034, 1049
A ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections, 1049, 1059
Additionally I am going to push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress, 1059, 1078
"Its about time." Not only will we end our government corruption but we will end the economic stagnation, 1078, 1096
My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs jobs jobs, 1096, 1112
At the center of my historic jobs plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals, 1112, 1127
47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps, 1127, 1141
We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 1141, 1164
"Ohio has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization – two Bill and Hillary-backed disasters." We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world, 1164, 1202
A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA stand up to foreign cheating and stop the jobs from leaving our country, 1202, 1223
I also have another major announcement I am going to make today that concerns manufacturing in the United States and how we are going to bring jobs back to Ohio Michigan Pennsylvania North Carolina and all across this great nation, 1223, 1263
American trade policy is currently mismanaged by dozens of competing bureaucracies spread across the Departments of Agriculture Commerce Labor State and Treasury Department and the U.S, 1263, 1289
Trade Representative, 1289, 1291
In my administration all trade policymaking will be consolidated in one Office, 1291, 1303
It will report to an American Desk and it will be located inside the Department of Commerce, 1303, 1320
The mission of the American Desk will be to protect the economic interests of the American worker and the national interests of the United States, 1320, 1345
"Its going to be America First." As part of our plan to bring back our jobs we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent, 1345, 1375
We are also going to rebuild our inner cities, 1375, 1384
African-Americans and Hispanics living in the inner cities are suffering, 1384, 1394
The violence is unbearable, 1394, 1398
You walk to the store with your child and you get shot, 1398, 1410
There is no education there are no jobs there is no safety, 1410, 1422
Nearly 3500 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, 1422, 1436
Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C, 1436, 1444
and more than 60% in Baltimore, 1444, 1450
"And its getting worse." To the African-American and Hispanic voters suffering I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, 1450, 1473
I will fix it, 1473, 1477
We will be a rich nation once again, 1477, 1485
But to be a rich country we must also be a safe country, 1485, 1498
National Security begins at the border, 1498, 1504
Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders." "Hillarys plan includes an open border with the Middle East – meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores." "Just last week an Iraqi refugee approved for entry by Hillary Clintons State Department pled guilty to joining ISIS." "So let me state this as clearly as I can, 1504, 1576
If Im elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country." We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration, 1576, 1601
A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders, 1601, 1610
And yes we will build a wall, 1610, 1617
We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers, 1617, 1629
There is another major policy announcement I would like to make today, 1629, 1641
Every year countless American lives are lost to Sanctuary Cities, 1641, 1651
My opponent strongly supports Sanctuary Cities like the ones that got Kate Steinle killed by a five-time deported criminal illegal immigrant, 1651, 1672
If I am elected President I am going to cut off federal funding to Sanctuary Cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, 1672, 1696
We are going to save American lives, 1696, 1703
Either we win this election or we lose the country, 1703, 1713
Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America and we are going to end common core; support the men and women of law enforcement; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1713, 1798
You have 19 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true, 1798, 1815
"Our campaign is powered by our love for this country and our love for our fellow citizens, 1815, 1832
Its a campaign about rejecting the cynicism and elitism of our failed political establishment." I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation, 1832, 1863
"Im going to fight for every child living in poverty, 1863, 1873
Im going to fight for every mom whose lost her child to illegal immigration and drugs and gang violence." "Im going to fight for every community whose jobs and factories have been ripped out of states like Ohio and shipped to other countries." "Im going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people – not the donors and special interests." And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1873, 1953
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1953, 1974
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 1974, 1988
Youre going to remember this day, 1988, 1994
This is a movement like youve never seen before, 1994, 2003
Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote youve ever cast for anyone at any time." Because if we win – We Will Make America Wealthy Again, 2003, 2040
We Will Make America Strong Again, 2040, 2046
We Will Make America Safe Again, 2046, 2052
And We Will Make America Great Again, 2052, 2059
