Thank you, 0, 2
Thank you very much, 2, 6
  Thank you very much, 6, 10
So amazing, 10, 12
Rudy just left, 12, 15
He just said "I dont believe this, 15, 22
This is unbelievable." Nobody believes it.n "The crowds were getting -- Im the messenger but Ill tell you what the message is the right message, 22, 47
Were tired of incompetence, 47, 51
Were tired of not taking care of our military, 51, 60
Were tired of not taking care of our vets who are being taken care of very poorly.n" Were tired of so many different things, 60, 84
And this is what happens, 84, 89
So our mayor my friend Rudy Giuliani just walks Im telling you he said "I dont believe this, 89, 107
This is incredible."n "And what he hasnt seen and your governor by the way whos a great guy.n" And hes now seeing it theyre walking outside because there are thousands of people outside that cant get in, 107, 144
I said "Rudy you think this is bad go take a look outside."n So I just want to thank Pat and Rudy and I want to thank everybody for being here, 144, 175
And we are going to have a good time, 175, 184
We love North Carolina, 184, 188
We love North Carolina  n We did really well in the primaries if you remember and I hear we are doing really well now, 188, 212
We have to win, 212, 216
That November 8 day is so important.n "You know I bring things up like the judges right? Supreme Court Justices we have to get - you know you could have as many as four? I guess its a scenario where this president could pick five Supreme Court Justices.n" "And if you pick two that are left left left its going to be a disaster for our country, 216, 283
Your Second Amendment the National Rifle Association endorsed and they endorsed me early a long time ago, 283, 300
And theyre great people Wayne and Chris they are great people, 300, 311
" n "But if you - if you do something with these - Ill tell you what Justices right now you lost a great one with Scalia, 311, 338
We want to replace with Justices very much like Justice Scalia and thats going to happen, 338, 354
It is so important.n" "So if for no other reason I mean its such an important - its one of the most important elections for a lot of reasons not just that but for a lot of reasons, 354, 392
But thats so obviously because for whatever reason they say this could be the presidency, 392, 407
This next four years is where you will pick more Supreme Court Justices than anybody has every had the opportunity to do, 407, 429
Believe me Ill make you very proud of those Justices everyday, 429, 440
" n "So we had an incident a few days ago with the $400 million - all cash right -- $400 million in all cash anybody know what that looks like? Thats a lot of cash, 440, 476
Thats a lot of case.n" "And honestly its so sad, 476, 486
Think of it going to Iran a terrorist state, 486, 495
Now I happen to think they have plenty of money weve given then $150 billion so the $400 million is just you know - I happen to think it goes into their accounts in Switzerland personally.n" Now a lot of people say "no no its used for terror" and they use it for terror because its the number one terror funder - not even close, 495, 560
But I also think that when you have $400 million in cash different denominations do you see the size of this? I guess they did release the pictures after all, 560, 590
They released pictures.n "And interesting Ill tell you I sort of think it goes into bank accounts right? You know I sort of think they take it they probably use some for this some for that, 590, 626
You can do a lot of things.n" "And Obama said that he did it because we dont have a working account with Iran, 626, 649
Do you believe that? How long does it take to set up an account? Right? You dont have a working account you set up an account right?n" "You set up an account and it takes about - look whats going on in this country - folks folks whats going on in this country is insane, 649, 704
And we have people running our country that dont know what theyre doing theyre grossly incompetent and its time, 704, 723
We have to make change real change, 723, 730
Not Obama change we have to make change.n" "Whether its Bergdahl we get Bergdahl who was a traitor and they get five of the greatest killers that theyve wanted for eight years, 730, 762
We get Bergdahl -- I call it the five for one trade, 762, 774
For the Iran deal where we get nothing we get nothing.n" "They get ultimately they have the path beautiful path theyll get way way earlier than that, 774, 801
Theyll get nuclear weapons so if you get Trump youre going to see a lot of changes to that deal, 801, 821
Thatll happen fast, 821, 824
" n Youre going to see some big changes and what I really -- I mean I saw where President Obama said that the $400 million in cash was not had nothing to do with the release of the hostages right? It really doesnt work does it? Does it? I mean remember Obamacare "youre going to keep your doctor youre going to keep your plan over and over again youre going to keep your doctor." It was a lie.n "And in fact if he didnt make the lie he would have never gotten it approved because most Democrats many of the Democrats didnt want to do it, 824, 931
It was only that that got them to sign it and to approve it, 931, 945
And it was a lie.n" "And the $400 million and from what the rumor is and from what the reports are the hostages couldnt leave the airport until this other plane arrived, 945, 977
They dont know why but I think we all have a pretty good reason why, 977, 992
It was all a big lie it was all a big lie.n" "And its so sad to see and let me tell you Hillary Clinton is going to be four more years of Obama but maybe worse, 992, 1029
Maybe worse, 1029, 1031
Therell be four more years, 1031, 1036
Four more years of ISIS four more years of high taxes, 1036, 1047
You know yesterday I had a -- at a big event really, 1047, 1059
It turned out to be a very big event in Detroit " n "Good event very good, 1059, 1076
And we got wonderful reviews and a lot of good comments, 1076, 1087
But the thing Im doing Im cutting taxes big league, 1087, 1097
Especially for the middle class and especially for businesses, 1097, 1106
Because businesses are dying and that means small businesses businesses period, 1106, 1117
" n "Businesses are leaving our country like theyve never left before, 1117, 1129
Theyre going all over, 1129, 1133
Theyre going to Mexico that I can tell you, 1133, 1142
Mexico is like the eighth wonder of the world, 1142, 1151
You know Ive been telling a story a friend of mine good friend of mine good guy, 1151, 1168
He builds plants he builds plants for cars for computers you know where they make them, 1168, 1184
Massive plants, 1184, 1186
And I said to him how are you doing?n" And hes worked in North Carolina by the way, 1186, 1204
I said to him how are you doing? He said phenomenal, 1204, 1215
Hes like "I think the biggest in the world at this -" thats what he does, 1215, 1231
Great guy, 1231, 1233
I said hows it all going? He said youve got to see Mexico Donald, 1233, 1247
Its the eighth wonder of the world, 1247, 1254
What were building there is like never has been built, 1254, 1264
Weve never seen anything like it".n "And I said how are we doing in the United States? Im more interested in that OK? Its OK I guess, 1264, 1291
Right? You know America first folks, 1291, 1297
America first, 1297, 1299
America, 1299, 1300
" n Right America first, 1300, 1305
 n "America first, 1305, 1308
We get a little tired of these deals where they actually put and you know why because of lobbyists and special interests and people representing and people wanting it to happen, 1308, 1339
Its just not that they want other countries to benefit over us, 1339, 1351
There are reasons for it and you know when I raise money and Im putting up a lot of money for my own campaign Im funding me.n" "And Im raising for the Republican party, 1351, 1385
And were getting a lot of money from the small donors.n" "Remember two months ago? Well I hadnt started; I wanted to make sure I get the nomination before I start right?n" "Let me get the nomination please, 1385, 1423
And then I took a lot of heat from the press the worlds most dishonest people by the way, 1423, 1442
"  Terrible, 1442, 1444
  Terrible, 1444, 1445
 n Those cameras will not move and show how many people are in this auditorium, 1445, 1460
Those cameras -- those cameras are not going on the move unless we have a protester is there a protester up there in the quota? Any protesters?  n "If we had a protester thats the only time they move because theyre showing something that in their mind is a bad thing so then they move, 1460, 1515
But I like that Ive always liked my protesters because the cameras show these massive crowds and people say wow was that a big crowd.n" "You know I go home to my wife I say hows it going? She says darling your speech was very good were there many people there? I say yeah about 7000, 1515, 1571
Thats a small group.n" Its only confined -- I mean you had to see outside, 1571, 1586
I felt so badly -- I came up -- I came up -- thank you and I love you too, 1586, 1606
Who said that? Who said that huh?  n "Thank you thank you, 1606, 1618
But I came up with Rudy from New York and were driving up and were going block after block after block the line, 1618, 1641
And I said are those people going to be able to get in?n" "They said the place is already full, 1641, 1661
And Rudy just said man; Ive never seen anything like that, 1661, 1672
Maybe a couple of days before an election but this is whats happening, 1672, 1685
Because of the fact we have a movement going folks.n" Because people are so tired of them, 1685, 1702
 n "Theyre so tired of them, 1702, 1708
" n "So -- and by the way -- and by the way voter ID watch with that, 1708, 1726
Watch with voter ID why arent we having voter ID? In other words I wanna vote heres my identification I wanna vote as opposed to somebody coming up and voting 15 times for Hillary, 1726, 1760
" n Well -- and I will not tell you to vote 15 times, 1760, 1774
I will not tell you to do that OK?  n "You wont vote 15 times, 1774, 1789
But people will theyll vote many times and how that couldve happened  its unbelievable, 1789, 1803
And the governor just told me that theyre going before the United States Supreme Court Justice Roberts and maybe they can get a stay, 1803, 1827
Lets see what happens OK? " n "Lets see what happens, 1827, 1838
Thats a very important thing, 1838, 1843
But I wrote a few things down and to me so important -- yes darling thank you, 1843, 1860
" n Unstable Hillary lacks the judgment now; Bernie Sanders said she lacks judgment right? And nobody said anything about it no problem, 1860, 1883
He said you lack judgment, 1883, 1888
And -- during one of the debates nobody said it was fine.n "When I say it they say thats terrible the way you talk, 1888, 1912
" n "She does she lacks judgment she lacks temperament and Im the one that used unfit many many months ago, 1912, 1933
And now theyve turned it around use it on me unfit? Im unfit? Thats -- thats a first, 1933, 1951
But she lacks the temperament and the moral character to lead this country its very simple.n" "She really does, 1951, 1970
Shes a dangerous person who doesnt tell the truth which has been proven very loudly.n" "Ive never seen a -- I dont think weve ever had greater proof of that of anybody, 1970, 2002
" n "And she has disregarded the lives of Americans -- you see whats happening -- with what she has done with her server? And you know why she did that.n" So I just look at this and I said that if she gets elected she will cause the destruction of this country from within, 2002, 2057
Remember that, 2057, 2059
Remember that, 2059, 2061
 n "She will -- she will allow people into our country that will do damage they will do damage folks, 2061, 2081
You look at whats going on in the world -- look at France; take a good look at France, 2081, 2100
I have friends that go to France, 2100, 2107
They used to love France.n" "They say no thank you, 2107, 2117
They dont expect to be going back anytime for a long time.n" "I have one friend I said how was your trip this year to France? He said France isnt France anymore, 2117, 2149
Were not going, 2149, 2152
And so many people are saying that.n" "Look at whats going on with Germany, 2152, 2166
Look at whats happening with Germany, 2166, 2172
Look at the crime; look at the problems, 2172, 2180
We have enough problems in our country right now, 2180, 2189
We dont need additional problems folks, 2189, 2195
We dont need additional problems, 2195, 2200
" n "And for all we know this could be the great Trojan Horse, 2200, 2214
This could be, 2214, 2217
We dont know who these people are.n" Now theyre coming in through Obama, 2217, 2230
And I looked at a chart yesterday and its like for years its sort of like this a little uptick, 2230, 2250
And the last number or period of time its like "Wah wah wah wah." There -- I have never seen anything like it.n "Theyre letting them in and again you cant vet them, 2250, 2283
You dont know where they come from, 2283, 2290
We dont know -- look at the damage that two people in San Bernardino probably radicalized the guy -- the woman coming in, 2290, 2313
Look at the damage in Orlando, 2313, 2319
Look at the damage that was done in Orlando by one wack job one sick wack job, 2319, 2336
And you know what he was screaming? Hes screaming what they all scream.n" "And we have to get smart folks, 2336, 2356
We dont need the problems -- and weve already got those problems just so you understand, 2356, 2372
Because theyre coming into the country theyre being put where nobody even knows where they are.n" "Its like if I were the enemy I would say I cant believe theyre that stupid, 2372, 2404
Theyre taking my people and theyre putting them all over the place because you have great military right here.n" And our military.., 2404, 2426
n "Our military cannot be beaten, 2426, 2432
But you know what could happen? When we dont know where they are where theyre coming youve them all over the place.n" "And folks its some, 2432, 2458
You dont need many; you dont need many, 2458, 2466
One person in Orlando, 2466, 2470
Two people -- look at in France 130, 2470, 2478
Now they have the strictest gun laws anywhere in the world France Paris, 2478, 2491
One hundred and thirty people killed 130.n" "And Ive said 100 times if this man or if this woman or if that woman or man had a gun in Paris or in San Bernardino and the bullets were flying in the other direction would have been a whole different story folks.n" Would have been a whole different, 2491, 2548
 n "For those -- for those foolish people that say Second Amendment would have been a whole different -- and Id go a step further, 2548, 2573
If these people bad people bad sick sick sick people.n" "If these people knew there were guns in the good guys hands right they probably wouldnt have gone in in the first place all right? All right? Gun free -- what do you think of these gun- free zones?n" "Do you know what a gun-free zone is? Thats like -- they study where the gun-free zones -- if they would have known you had guns if they would have known that they were going to be shot at from the other side it would have been a whole different story, 2573, 2673
Maybe it wouldnt have even happened in the first place.n" So they better not come here, 2673, 2689
They better not, 2689, 2692
They better not, 2692, 2695
 n So recently a book came out a couple of weeks ago, 2695, 2707
A Secret Service agent made a statement because she said the other day she short-circuited, 2707, 2722
Hey could you imagine if I said that "I short circuited"?  n They would be calling for my execution -- electric chair, 2722, 2744
Theyd bring back the electric chair, 2744, 2750
It would be a whole different ball game if I said it believe me, 2750, 2764
But the Secret Service agent said "She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office" right?n "From the bottom of my soul" he said "I know this to be true, 2764, 2797
Her leadership style which is volcanic and impulsive and she makes bad decisions, 2797, 2810
OK? Hey you know its one thing to make bad decisions, 2810, 2821
Its another thing to be wacky and make bad decisions, 2821, 2831
 n "She is disdainful of the rules set for everyone else and she hasnt changed a bit, 2831, 2848
This is -- that was the good thing, 2848, 2856
I couldnt say the bad things, 2856, 2862
It was too much, 2862, 2866
Nobody would even -- nobody would even believe it, 2866, 2875
Youve got to see this book, 2875, 2881
Nobody would believe because its so terrible so terrible.n" "And she comes across like this woman -- nice easy -- but shes not, 2881, 2904
And -- and shes -- listen -- shes not a leader not a leader, 2904, 2918
And she is a liar, 2918, 2923
" n "Hey hey -- 33000 e-mails are gone, 2923, 2932
OK? 33000 e-mails are gone, 2932, 2937
Theyre gone, 2937, 2939
How do you get rid of 33000 e-mails? Who sends 33000 e-mails? I mean 33 -- do you know how many that is? I think thats like 24 hours a day reading them or sending them but it wouldnt matter, 2939, 2979
For years 33000 e-mails are missing.n" "And shes so guilty, 2979, 2989
Shes so guilty, 2989, 2992
" n "I think its a tremendous blot in our country, 2992, 3003
I really mean that, 3003, 3007
I think what happened over the last two weeks with respect to her especially in light of the fact that General Petraeus and many others have suffered unbelievable consequences, 3007, 3036
I think its a tremendous blot on our country a tremendous blot, 3036, 3048
Just remember that.n" But I just looked at this -- the economic failures of Obama and Clinton et cetera, 3048, 3067
Obama-Clinton economic policies have produced 1.2 percent economic growth the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 3067, 3084
Now this is like unbelievable -- 1.2.n "Do you know China goes to 7 percent or 8 percent its like a national catastrophe, 3084, 3107
Now what they do is they cut their currency.n" They devalue their currency and big league and then all of our businesses continue to be drained out of the United States, 3107, 3138
Our money our jobs, 3138, 3142
They make our product they sell our product to us, 3142, 3152
No tax no nothing you devalue -- see devaluing is sort of cheating.n "You know its sort of like cheating, 3152, 3172
Now I have great relationships with China, 3172, 3179
Ive done great business with China Ive done really well with China, 3179, 3191
I have these tenants I sell condos I own the Bank of America building in San Francisco with a group a great group thank you maam, 3191, 3217
" n Got to win -- got to win North Carolina, 3217, 3228
Thank you, 3228, 3230
 n "Thank you, 3230, 3233
But they -- its cheating its really cheating, 3233, 3241
And when I look at these trade deals -- its so sad -- where we lose $800 billion -- billion with B -- dollars a year on trade with China alone its $400 billion and $500 billion and $505 billion, 3241, 3281
This is year in and year out its actually amazing that our country keeps going, 3281, 3296
But what has happened is we have people in the audience in 18 years theyre making less money now than they made 18 years ago in real wages 18.n" "And in many cases theyre working two and three jobs OK? But theyre making less money now than they made 18 years ago, 3296, 3348
And those stats come right out real wages, 3348, 3356
Theyre working harder theyre getting older.n" "So in theory its supposed to be the other way you know you work and youre young you dont care, 3356, 3382
Get a little older its like oh by the way how about me? I think Im working harder too if you want to know, 3382, 3406
" n "I never worked this hard in my life, 3406, 3416
But I like it I like it I love it actually because Ive met so many incredible people, 3416, 3434
You know I really got -- thank you -- I really got a tremendous understanding of this country, 3434, 3452
Because Im going to places that Ive heard about Ive known about Im stopping everywhere, 3452, 3467
And I see the carnage that NAFTA has caused I see the carnage, 3467, 3480
Its been horrible, 3480, 3483
I see upstate New York I see North Carolina but I see every state, 3483, 3497
You look at New England, 3497, 3502
New England got really whacked, 3502, 3507
New England got hit.n" "You look at Ohio what happened there and still happening, 3507, 3521
By the way this isnt like its going to happen or its all over its getting worse, 3521, 3538
You look at Ohio you look at Michigan whats going on with the car plants being built in Mexico is unbelievable.n" "And more and more you know theyre moving, 3538, 3567
We were just talking about the autoworkers yesterday, 3567, 3575
Where theyve lost over 100000 autoworkers in Michigan the state of Michigan which is our car capital and its really not the car capital anymore, 3575, 3600
Mexico will become the new car capital of the world in a very short period of time, 3600, 3617
No think of it.n" "And thats only because we allow it to happen, 3617, 3630
And I like Mexico, 3630, 3634
And I respect the leaders of Mexico because theyre much smarter theyre much street smarter but theyre much smarter and more cunning than our leaders, 3634, 3659
But you have to see whats going on, 3659, 3667
And one of the reasons I won Indiana was Bobby Knight because hes the best hes the greatest, 3667, 3685
" n "But one of the reasons is that Carrier Air Conditioning let 1400 people go and theyre building a plant in Mexico, 3685, 3708
And were not going to let it happen , 3708, 3716
.n" "Its a suicidal pact for our country, 3716, 3724
And you know Ive watched for years.n" "I was never a politician until 14 months ago, 3724, 3740
So I cant believe Im saying Im a politician, 3740, 3749
" n "Cant believe it, 3749, 3754
" n "But -- but Ive been watching for years and Ive watched as -- as the government tries to keep businesses from leaving our country and going to other countries, 3754, 3785
And Ive seen low interest loans Ive seen zero interest loans Ive seen all sorts of subsidies.n" "I get it, 3785, 3805
That stuffs not gonna work thats not gonna work, 3805, 3814
Whats gonna work is -- as an example Carrier moves to Mexico and you wish him a lot of luck good luck have a nice plant, 3814, 3840
I hope my friend bills it right?n" "And then you know what happens? When they make their air conditioners -- and then think theyre gonna sell that air conditioner people living in Indianapolis -- where they come from -- for a similar price.n" "And they think theyre gonna sell it there and have no repercussions? With me they have repercussions OK? " n With me they have repercussions, 3840, 3908
 n "With me we inform them that if you move youre gonna pay a 35 percent tax on every single air conditioner that pour across our now very secure borders, 3908, 3938
" n "And two things are gonna happen one of two things -- one of two things are gonna happen, 3938, 3958
Number one if you get them in time theyre not moving, 3958, 3969
Throws it all off-balance since theyre all off-kilter, 3969, 3977
Number one theyre not -- now nobody -- people would say well why doesnt anybody use this? Why doesnt anybody mention it?n" "Ill tell you why, 3977, 4003
Because theyre controlled by their lobbyists theyre politicians, 4003, 4011
And Carrier goes out or whoever it might be this -- Im just using Carrier as an example, 4011, 4029
Its hundreds and thousands, 4029, 4033
Its thousands of company.n" "And millions of jobs were talking about, 4033, 4044
I was looking at numbers -- Im not gonna repeat the numbers because theyll say I was wrong it cant be that high I couldnt believe it was that high, 4044, 4074
But its thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.n" "And youd say why arent -- like why doesnt somebody else say what Trump is saying? So Im controlled by myself because Im putting up my money OK? Im putting up my money, 4074, 4118
" n But.., 4118, 4121
n Although we raised did you see $82 million last month $82 million last month?  n "And a lot of it -- a lot of the money was the small donations which Republicans never get, 4121, 4156
A lot of them -- I think it averaged $61 a hit $61 can you imagine that? The total that we raised and in fact in May I told you I was taking heat because they said Donald Trump didnt raise any money.n" "And they told you why right? I didnt raise it because I didnt know -- I gotta make sure I got the nomination, 4156, 4222
