Thank you, 0, 2
It is so great to be in my second home Florida and in the city of Miami where I have so many wonderful friends and employees, 2, 28
"New polls have just come in and were leading in battleground states all over this country – including four points here in Florida, 28, 51
LA Times has us up 6 points nationwide." Come November 8th we are going to win Florida and we are going to win the White House, 51, 77
"Its going to be a victory for the people – its going to be a victory for the workers the families the Veterans the everyday citizens." "And its going to be a victory for those who havent had reason for hope in a long time." "Im campaigning in every community and every part of this country for every last vote, 77, 137
I am running to be a President for all Americans." "I just had the most amazing afternoon in Little Haiti and Im going to be campaigning hard for their votes, 137, 167
What incredible people." Our support comes from all regions all backgrounds and all walks of life, 167, 183
You are cops and soldiers carpenters and welders accountants and lawyers young and old rich and poor black white and Hispanic – but above all else you are American, 183, 212
Just today I was honored to get the endorsement of recipients of the Medal of Honor and many of our amazing military leaders, 212, 235
We now have the endorsements of more than 160 top generals and Admirals, 235, 248
We also have the support of 16500 Border Patrol Officers – as well as law enforcement officers across the country, 248, 268
And we have the support of millions of patriotic Moms and Dads who go to work every day and make this country run, 268, 291
While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable I call you hardworking American patriots who love your family and love your country, 291, 314
"Clintons campaign relies on the tired tactic of smearing opponents who question her policies as racists, 314, 330
Its the oldest play in the Democratic play book – and Americans have had enough." They want solutions and they want better lives – not more petty attacks from failed and discredited politicians, 330, 363
People who want their immigration laws enforced and their borders secured are not racists, 363, 377
They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected, 377, 391
People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes, 391, 401
They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe, 401, 418
People who support the police and who want crime reduced are not prejudiced, 418, 431
They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence, 431, 450
Yet while she lives behind gates and walls and guards and raises millions from hedge fund managers and Wall Street donors she slanders and smears working people who just want a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians, 450, 489
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State hide and delete her emails destroy her phones with a hammer put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to Congress and sell government favors and access through the Clinton Foundation, 489, 543
"Its the same attitude of arrogance and entitlement that explains why she has never taken accountability for the disasters she created in Libya Syria Iraq Iran and all over the world, 543, 574
Its the same reason why she wont take responsibility for her central role in unleashing ISIS." Her policies have created disaster overseas and poverty at home, 574, 600
I am running to reverse these failures and create a New American future, 600, 613
That future begins with prosperity at home, 613, 620
My economic agenda can be summed up in three words: jobs jobs jobs, 620, 633
One of my highest priorities is to bring jobs into our inner cities, 633, 646
African-Americans communities have suffered horribly as a result of failed Democratic leadership, 646, 658
"Democrats have run these inner cities for half a century, 658, 668
They control the mayors offices the school boards the city councils and the seats in Congress – and all they have delivered is more poverty more crime and more failing schools." 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 now live in poverty, 668, 712
More than 3000 have been shot in Chicago this year alone, 712, 723
58% of African-American youth are not working, 723, 730
"These are the results of the policies embraced by Hillary Clinton and everyone knows that if shes elected the inner cities will get nothing but more pain and more suffering." Hillary Clinton has been there in Washington for 30 years – her disastrous record speaks for itself, 730, 777
The only people she delivers for is her donors, 777, 786
I am going to deliver for you the American people, 786, 796
If we lower our taxes remove destructive regulations unleash the vast treasure of American energy and negotiate trade deals that put America First then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash, 796, 840
My first day in office I am going to order a review of every single regulation issued over the last eight years, 840, 862
All needless job-killing regulations will be cancelled, 862, 869
Millions of new jobs will come pouring in, 869, 877
We are going to lift the restrictions on American energy – which means at least another half a million new jobs a year, 877, 900
"Thats just the beginning." Also on my first day I am going to ask Congress to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare – this will instantly save another 2 million jobs, 900, 936
"I am also going to completely reform our trade deals, 936, 946
We are going to renegotiate NAFTA stand up to China and keep America out of the TPP, 946, 963
We dont need another massive multinational deal that ties us up and binds us down." "Another major reform is going to be school choice, 963, 987
Ive outlined a plan to provide every disadvantaged child in America the freedom to choose the private public magnet or religious school of his or her choice." This will help lift millions of poor African-American and Hispanic children out of poverty, 987, 1028
Since President Obama came into office another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have fallen into poverty, 1028, 1042
This is unacceptable, 1042, 1045
To the Hispanic community I say: we are going to protect your jobs we are going to build up your schools and we are going to deliver safety and opportunity for your children, 1045, 1078
Earlier this week I also rolled out a plan to help our mothers and our families get affordable quality childcare for their children, 1078, 1101
On policy after policy we are going to provide opportunity prosperity and security for all Americans, 1101, 1117
We are also going to stand with the Cuban people in their fight against communist oppression, 1117, 1133
"The Presidents one-sided deal for Cuba benefits only the Castro Regime, 1133, 1144
But all of the concessions that Barack Obama has granted the Castro Regime were done through executive order which means the next President can reverse them – and that is what I will do unless the Castro Regime meets our demands, 1144, 1185
Those demands will include religious and political freedom for the Cuban people." "Lets also talk about Venezuela." Venezuela is a beautiful vibrant and resource-rich country filled with amazing and hardworking people, 1185, 1216
But Venezuela has been run into the ground by socialists, 1216, 1226
The next President of the United States must stand in solidarity with all people oppressed in our hemisphere and I will stand with the oppressed people of Venezuela yearning to be free, 1226, 1258
Here in America I will push to expand freedom for all of our people, 1258, 1272
"I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations on business and in your life; Im going to repeal and replace Obamacare; Im going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; Im going to rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; Im going to save your 2nd amendment; Im going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country and yes we will build the wall and Im going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals especially NAFTA – and we will make great trade deals that put the American worker first." We will rebuild our roads bridges tunnels highways airports schools and hospitals, 1272, 1394
American cars will travel the roads American planes will soar in the skies and American ships will patrol the seas, 1394, 1414
American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds, 1414, 1423
American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy mined from American sources will power this nation, 1423, 1441
American workers will be hired to do the job, 1441, 1450
We will put new American steel into the spine of this country, 1450, 1462
I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as One American People, 1462, 1486
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1486, 1507
It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past and to embrace a new inclusive and prosperous American future, 1507, 1529
Jobs will return incomes will rise and new factories will come rushing back to our shores, 1529, 1545
Once more we will have a government of by and for the people, 1545, 1558
We Will Make America Prosperous Again, 1558, 1564
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1564, 1570
And Will Make America Great Again, 1570, 1576
Thank you and God Bless! , 1576, 1581
