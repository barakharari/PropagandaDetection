"The House Natural Resources Committee reached an agreement on a bipartisan bill to address thexa0Puertoxa0Ricanxa0debt crisis, 0, 16
While I havexa0seriousxa0concerns about several provisions in this bill including the creation of an oversight board that would exert substantial control overxa0Puertoxa0Rico I believe that we must move forward with this legislation, 16, 48
Otherwise without any means of addressing this crisis too manyxa0Puertoxa0Ricansxa0will continue to suffer, 48, 61
However as this bill moves forward I will work to ensure that concerns about the oversight board are addressed and any such entity includes members that will act in the best interest ofxa0Puertoxa0Ricansxa0-- protecting their health their pensions and their well-being, 61, 102
We can no longer sit idly by while hedge funds seek to maximize their profits at the islands expense, 102, 121
Thats whyxa0I will continue to stand with thexa0Puertoxa0Ricansxa0to ensure that they can put their economy back on a path of stability and prosperity including the steps I am committed to take as President to provide equality in critical federal programs." , 121, 161
