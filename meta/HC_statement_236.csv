"nAs a young lawyer working for the Childrens Defense Fund I started my career fighting for the inclusion of children with disabilities in our schools, 0, 25
And Ive never stopped fighting to break down the barriers that hold people with disabilities back, 25, 41
In this campaign I have committed to improving opportunities for people with disabilities to live in integrated community settings consistent with the full promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Supreme Courts historicxa0" xa0decision, 41, 77
As President I am committed to ensuring that these promises are fulfilled, 77, 89
That is why I support the Disability Integration Act sponsored by Senator Schumer and co-sponsored by Senators Gillibrand Casey Bennet and Leahy, 89, 111
The bill ensures that states and insurance providers offer home- and community-based services to anybody who needs long-term services and support and is eligible for institutional care thereby ensuring that people who need support have a choice in how those services are delivered, 111, 154
I am proud to affirm my support for this bill and hope all members of Congress will do so, 154, 173
