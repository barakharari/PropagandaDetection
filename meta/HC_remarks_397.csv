"Thank you, 0, 2
Thank you all so much, 2, 7
It is great being here on the stage at UNH with my friend Bernie Sanders one of the most passionate champions for equality and justice that I have ever seen and someone who I am looking forward to working with to get cheers the kind of agenda through our Congress that will begin to make our country stronger by providing the kind of support that working families and middle class families so richly deserve, 7, 81
"Bernies campaign energized so many young people some of you in this crowd, 81, 94
And there is no group of Americans who have more at stake in this election than young Americans because so much of what will happen will affect your lives your jobs the kind of country we are the kind of future we want to build together." "Im proud of the primary campaign that Bernie and I ran, 94, 151
We ran a campaign about issues not insults, 151, 159
And when it was over we began to work together to try to figure out how we could take the issues we agreed on and come together knowing we are stronger together to come up with specific policies in education in health and so much else, 159, 205
Thank you Bernie, 205, 208
Thank you for your leadership and thank you for your support in this campaign." "Now were going to need some help in Washington, 208, 231
And I hope New Hampshire will send your now Governor Maggie Hassan to Washington as your senator, 231, 248
And I sure hope you will send Carol Shea Porter back to Washington." "Isnt this one of the strangest elections youve ever seen? I – I really sometimes dont know what to make of it, 248, 283
Standing on that debate stage the other night I was especially thinking about that, 283, 297
And look I have been very clear about what I want to do if Im fortunate enough to be elected president, 297, 318
And Americans increasingly are zeroing in on the fact that were not only electing a president were electing a commander-in-chief, 318, 338
Were looking to see who can protect our country and provide steady and strong leadership around the world." "I was very honored today to earn the endorsement of John Warner a retired Republican senator World War II veteran former – former secretary of the Navy who served under two Republican presidents, 338, 389
I served with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee, 389, 399
And I have the deepest respect for his patriotism, 399, 408
And its a great honor, 408, 413
Hes never endorsed a Democrat for president before, 413, 421
And Im also very grateful that a number of Republicans and Independents here in New Hampshire have announced their support for this campaign, 421, 444
In fact it is really an extraordinary honor that 150 Republicans here in New Hampshire are supporting this campaign because they understand how high the stakes are." "The next – the next 40 days will determine the next 40 years, 444, 484
So Im going to close my campaign the way I started my public service and my career: fighting for kids and families, 484, 506
Thats been the cause of my life, 506, 513
And it will be the mission of my presidency, 513, 522
And when you go to vote in November or if you vote early its not just my name on the ballot, 522, 543
Every issue you care about think about it because in effect its on the ballot too, 543, 559
Its whether or not we continue to fight climate change or we give in to denial, 559, 575
This is a big deal, 575, 580
I never thought when I gave my acceptance speech to the Democratic National Convention that I would have to put in the following sentence I believe in science, 580, 608
Climate change is real, 608, 612
Its serious, 612, 614
And we have to be united and committed in addressing it, 614, 625
I never thought Id hear someone running for president my opponent who says he wants to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn marriage equality and turn the clock back on LGBT Americans overturn a womans right to make her own healthcare decisions and reverse that fundamental right and so much more." "So theres a lot at stake, 625, 683
And thats why some of the analysts are saying more Americans will vote in this election than ever before, 683, 702
We had more people watching that debate than any presidential debate before, 702, 714
And thats why we have to focus on what we want to do because I want to make a difference in your lives." "And one of the biggest issues that I heard about throughout the campaign that I hear about from every corner of our country is how much an education costs, 714, 766
Bernie is absolutely right, 766, 770
I remember when I went to college my dad who was a small business man – he had saved up money but I had to work, 770, 796
I had to work through college work during the school year work during summers but that was okay, 796, 814
We were able to put it together, 814, 821
It wasnt so much that it endangered me or my familys financial future." "And then I decided to go to law school and my dad said Well I cant help you, 821, 852
That – were done, 852, 856
We cant help you, 856, 860
So I kept working, 860, 864
I got a small scholarship but then I took out loans, 864, 875
And I paid those loans back, 875, 881
But I was lucky because I signed up for a program that gave me the opportunity to pay my loans back as a percentage of my in-come not a fixed interest rate, 881, 913
Thats why I could go to work for the Childrens Defense Fund, 913, 925
I think I made $14000 a year as I recall, 925, 935
I could never have done that if I had had the kind of interest rates that so many young people now are facing." "Its absolutely wrong and it has undermined the fundamental right to pursue your dreams to have that education to get those opportunities that you so rightly deserve." "Now New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt in the country and the second-highest average debt per student, 935, 1006
As a student I met here in New Hampshire said going to college should be hard but paying for college shouldnt be so hard that it prevents you from getting your education." "Indeed here in New Hampshire weve got so many young people graduating with debt who arent able to get started in their careers arent able to do the jobs like I could do because they have to get a job that pays as much as possible to begin paying their debt down, 1006, 1090
So we should and we will make public colleges tuition-free for families earning less than $125000 a year." "And if you already have student debt like so many students have here in New Hamp-shire we will help you refinance it, 1090, 1130
It is absolutely outrageous that you cannot refinance student debt and it is even worse that youre being charged interest rates that are so much higher than anything that anybody else is paying to buy a house to buy a car to borrow money for a business, 1130, 1177
I dont know how we got to where we are but we are going to fix it, 1177, 1194
This is wrong, 1194, 1197
Its wrong for students its wrong for families and its wrong for our country." "I also have met a lot of young people who want to start a business, 1197, 1226
They want to be entrepreneurs, 1226, 1231
Its the classic American story; start that business in the garage or the basement; get going, 1231, 1247
But they cant get credit because they have student debt, 1247, 1257
Nobody will help them out no matter how good the idea is, 1257, 1269
So were going to put a moratorium so you dont have to pay your student debt back for a couple of years while you try to get your business started and you get the chance to get the credit you need." "We are also – we are also going to provide loan forgiveness for people willing to go into public service or national service, 1269, 1333
And in Florida on Friday Ill give a speech about why that is so important." "Now when you add it up our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars, 1333, 1365
Our campaign has built a tool to help you see how our college plan will actually help you not in general but really specifically you the situation youre in, 1365, 1394
To check it out go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator." "Now we have an example right here and this presentation is what you can see when you go to our website, 1394, 1422
You can say I have student debt you can say I am planning for college you can put in what your annual household income is how much you will save and we are trying to make it as specific as possible because I dont want anybody to miss out on what this plan can do for you, 1422, 1479
You can choose whether you have student debt." "I met a young woman just yesterday in North Carolina who said Nobody really ex-plained to me and my family what I was getting into, 1479, 1512
I hear that so much, 1512, 1517
You know these financial aid forms one is called FAFSA it takes forever to fill out and at the end of it you really dont know what it means? Well were going to be really explicit, 1517, 1553
You know we do have technology in America, 1553, 1561
And we ought to use it more to help people understand what theyre getting into and to provide alternatives so that they dont make the wrong decisions for themselves." "So please use this you know? You will save $60640 if youre in one of these categories, 1561, 1607
But there is a way to understand the choices you have to make for everybody, 1607, 1622
So I hope you will go to hillaryclinton.com/calculator." "But I have to say this: none of this will happen if you all dont turn out and vote, 1622, 1649
None of it, 1649, 1652
You know I see all the signs saying I will vote, 1652, 1663
There is also a website, 1663, 1668
Please go to iwillvote.com to make sure youre registered, 1668, 1677
All the information is there, 1677, 1682
You put in your name you put in your address and through the miracle of technology you can find out if youre registered or maybe because you moved you were purged from the records and you have to register again, 1682, 1722
New Hampshire makes it easy, 1722, 1727
You can have same-day registration." "So both Bernie and I are excited about what we can do together, 1727, 1745
I am really looking forward to working with him and other strong Democrats and Republicans who want to help solve problems again in America, 1745, 1769
Bringing people together is what Im going to spend a lot of my time doing as your president, 1769, 1787
And if youve had a chance to see or meet my running mate Tim Kaine you know how hard hell work to get things done and make it a high priority to produce results." "So were going to move now to the panel and Im very pleased to have Mary Jo Brown moderating along with Doug Martin who you heard from earlier, 1787, 1849
I know they have collected up questions from the crowd, 1849, 1859
But I will end by saying that Im excited about what we can do to make college affordable and especially as Bernie rightly said open the doors to families and young people who have been left out, 1859, 1896
We also want to make Pell grants once again available year-round and we want to make sure that we have – specific help for certain groups of students." "Ill end with this story, 1896, 1929
I taught at the University of Arkansas Law School some years ago and I met a lot of students not only in the law school but students on campus, 1929, 1958
Id go and eat with them and go to events with them and I met a lot of students who scraped together the tuition money but then something happened, 1958, 1987
You know maybe they were already parents and their childcare fell apart, 1987, 1999
Maybe they had to drive to and from school; they lived out in the country and their old car finally broke down and there was no public transportation, 1999, 2027
Or maybe they had a health emergency, 2027, 2034
And they would come and they would say to me What can I do? Where can I get the $300 to fix the car? Where can I find childcare? How can I pay the doctors bills?" "And I realized that weve got to take care of tuition making sure that you can go and be able to start and finish school, 2034, 2095
Weve got to make sure costs and expenses Pell grants and other ways of helping, 2095, 2110
But we also have to fill the gaps that exist for a lot of students, 2110, 2125
So I helped to start something called the Arkansas Single-Parent Scholarship Fund because the people who had the most unexpected expenses were young parents mostly but not always single moms young divorced pretty much on their own trying to improve their lives and prospects." "And we started a fund to help fill those gaps and you know we did it over so many years now about 35 years and weve helped thousands of people so they didnt have to drop out, 2125, 2206
They didnt have to cut back, 2206, 2212
Thats what I want for our country again where were helping each other where were reaching out and giving everybody a chance and yes sometimes a second or third chance to make the most of their lives to pursue their dreams, 2212, 2253
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody and education is absolutely essential to it." So please make sure you come out and vote in this election, 2253, 2282
Thank you all." , 2282, 2285
