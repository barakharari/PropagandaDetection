"It is a glorious night here at the university in Columbus in the great state of Ohio, 0, 17
And I am thrilled to be here with all of you, 17, 28
And I want to thank Tony for his introduction, 28, 37
He made the greatest case against my opponent didnt he? Thank you Tony, 37, 50
And thanks to Mayor Ginther and Congresswoman Beatty and to my great friend your former governor and with your help the next senator Ted Strickland, 50, 75
"Any of you see that debate last night? Ill tell you what Im not sure youll ever see anything like that again, 75, 97
At least I hope you wont, 97, 103
It was such a clear display of whats at stake in this election, 103, 116
And I am thrilled to have the chance to talk with all of you about what we can do together because I truly believe we are stronger together, 116, 144
To move our country forward." "Now the one thing I thought about last night and said was as I was standing there on the stage with my opponent was to remember what Michelle Obama had said, 144, 180
To paraphrase her one of us went low and one of us went high, 180, 194
I want you to understand I want to be a president for all Americans, 194, 208
I think the American dream is big enough for everybody, 208, 218
And I am honored to have support not just from Democrats but from independents and Republicans because weve got to pull this country together if were going to move into the future together creating what we need for ourselves and our children." "Now I got to tell you tomorrow is a big day in Ohio for this election because tomorrow October 11th is the last day to register in Ohio, 218, 288
And I hope every one of you will take your phones out go to iwillvote.com to confirm that you are registered, 288, 309
Because we want everybody to vote and we particularly want young people to vote because this is your election more than anybody elses." "When I think about the challenges that were facing I dont think any one person has all the answers, 309, 351
I think we have to listen to each other and respect each other and celebrate our diversity because that makes us smarter as well as stronger." "Donald Trump spent his time last night attacking me when he should have been apologizing, 351, 392
We all heard on that tape what he thinks of women and how he treats women, 392, 408
And last night he doubled down on his excuse saying that well its just locker room banter, 408, 425
You know whats happened today which is so interesting is that a lot of athletes and coaches from the NBA from Major League Baseball from the NFL and more have been coming forward tweeting theyve been saying no thats not what happens in our locker rooms, 425, 471
And I just happen to think that our athletes and our coaches know a lot more about what happens in locker rooms than Donald Trump does." "But it wasnt just this one video that was so disturbing even shocking, 471, 510
We have seen this kind of behavior throughout this entire campaign and its not just about women, 510, 527
Yes hes insulted and demeaned women; weve seen it over and over again, 527, 540
But he has targeted others as well, 540, 547
Hes disrespected and denigrated African Americans and Latinos Muslims and POWs people with disabilities and immigrants, 547, 563
He is an equal-opportunity insulter if there ever was one." "That is not what we are in America, 563, 581
And it may be who he is but this election is our chance to show who we are, 581, 599
We are better than that, 599, 604
We are bigger than that, 604, 609
And I want to send a message to every boy and girl every man and woman in our country indeed to the entire world that that is not who America is, 609, 640
And we can do that by making sure that we turn out in the biggest numbers ever, 640, 657
Some analysts are saying we may have the biggest presidential election than weve had in a really long time, 657, 676
And the main reason is because your generation the young people of America are the most tolerant open and generous generation in American history." "You know whats at stake but you also know what you believe, 676, 712
And you dont want someone who says that hes going to appoint Supreme Court justices who will reverse marriage equality; who will – who will keep Citizens United one of the worst decisions ever made that allowed dark unaccountable money in our electoral system; that will reverse a womans right to make her own health care decisions; who will defund Planned Parenthood, 712, 774
You know better than that, 774, 779
You are helping us move toward a more perfect union, 779, 789
That has been the story of America at our best, 789, 799
We keep widening the circle of opportunity and inviting more people in, 799, 811
If youre willing to do your part youre willing to make your contribution there is a place for you in this nation of ours." "We dont have to make America great, 811, 842
Weve got to do what we can to make sure it remains great and it becomes greater because we keep broadening that circle of opportunity." "And please never forget America is great because America is good and if we deviate if we deviate from our fundamental values – and thats indeed the kind of campaign my opponent has run, 842, 901
He has said he would order our men and women in uniform to commit war crimes, 901, 917
He has said he would impose a religious test on who could come into our country – a nation founded on religious freedom and liberty, 917, 942
This is turning the clock back not just a few years but centuries, 942, 955
The only way to rebuke this is to vote, 955, 964
Use the single most important fundamental right you have as citizens of America." "And when you do I want you to know what youre voting for because I dont want you just to vote against something, 964, 1000
I want you to vote for something, 1000, 1007
And heres what were going to do." "I believe our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top, 1007, 1028
So I am ending this campaign the way I started my career all those years ago when I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund, 1028, 1054
As soon as I got out of law school I said I dont want to do anything else other than work hard and advocate for kids and families, 1054, 1082
So I was fortunate to have the chance to be really on the front lines of a lot of change helping to get the law that enabled people kids with disabilities to go to school, 1082, 1117
Now most of you may not have any reason to remember this because you werent born but – there was a time in our country not so long ago when if you had a disability if you lived in a school district there was no requirement that they make accommodations for you, 1117, 1169
And literally millions of kids were denied an education, 1169, 1178
I went door to door getting information about what was going on with these children so that I could contribute a report to a big national effort to go to the Congress and say this is wrong – in America were better than this, 1178, 1222
Open the doors of our schools to kids with disabilities." And then I was privileged to work to make sure that we got young people out of adult jails and prisons where they had no reason to be in the first place, 1222, 1264
"So when Donald Trump talks about what Ive been doing for the last 30 years I welcome that, 1264, 1282
I welcome it because in the 1970s I was working to end discrimination and he was being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination against people in his apartments, 1282, 1312
And in the 1980s I was working to improve the schools in Arkansas to make sure that teachers were well paid and that the coursework was going to prepare kids for the future while he was getting a loan for $14 million from his father to start a business, 1312, 1361
And in the 1990s I went to the UN Conference on Women and said womens rights are human rights – while he was insulting Miss Universe Alicia Machado, 1361, 1389
And on the day – on the day that I was in the Situation Room watching the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice he was hosting Celebrity Apprentice, 1389, 1419
So if he wants to talk about what we have been doing the last 30 years bring it on." "So weve got to make up our minds about what kind of economy we want, 1419, 1453
And Im pretty clear about that, 1453, 1459
I think we want new jobs with rising incomes, 1459, 1468
And I want us to have the biggest new jobs effort since the end of World War II, 1468, 1486
And I have some specific ideas in mind, 1486, 1494
We are going to have a big investment in infrastructure: our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our water systems, 1494, 1517
They need to be upgraded and maintained and built, 1517, 1526
That is a question of competitiveness, 1526, 1532
We have to have a competitive economy, 1532, 1539
Our airports are so rundown we dont even have one airport in our entire country in the top 25 in the world because were not using the newest technology, 1539, 1568
Were not really prepared to do what we need to to invest in you and invest in those new jobs." "I do want to bring advanced manufacturing, 1568, 1595
I heard Ted Strickland talking about that, 1595, 1602
I think we can have a manufacturing renaissance, 1602, 1610
There is no reason that we cannot own new manufacturing, 1610, 1620
Im not interested in a race to the bottom in competing for low-wage jobs, 1620, 1634
I am interested in competing for the high-wage jobs, 1634, 1643
So lets lead in precision machining 3D printing." "And lets be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, 1643, 1662
Some nations going to have that title, 1662, 1669
I think its either going to be Germany or China or us, 1669, 1681
It should be us, 1681, 1685
No question it should be, 1685, 1690
Were going to fight climate change, 1690, 1696
And were going to lead the world in fulfilling the requirements of the Paris agreement." "Im running against somebody who doesnt believe in climate change or at least he says he doesnt  who has even said he thinks its a hoax created by the Chinese, 1696, 1741
Well right now the Chinese have twice as much renewable energy as we do, 1741, 1755
So maybe they think its a hoax but theyre investing, 1755, 1765
And theyre creating, 1765, 1768
And theyre going to want to export, 1768, 1775
And what a shame it would be, 1775, 1782
We have innovated, 1782, 1785
We have made the technology that could bring us into the forefront of this, 1785, 1799
And were going to do it." "When I am president I want all of you who care about science technology engineering mathematics I want you to be part of it, 1799, 1829
And while we are growing the economy we are going to make it fairer, 1829, 1843
We are going to raise the national minimum wage because no one who works full-time should be left in poverty, 1843, 1863
And dont you think it is finally time to guarantee equal pay for womens work?" "You know back in the spring I was at a town hall in Las Vegas, 1863, 1893
And the little girl raised her hand, 1893, 1900
And I called on her, 1900, 1905
And she said to me If youre elected president does a girl president make the same as a boy president?" I said "Well thats one of those jobs where they have to publish what you make." So were going to have more transparency so people have more incentive to make sure that everybody is treated fairly, 1905, 1961
"And Ill tell you something else, 1961, 1967
I want to do more to promote profit-sharing, 1967, 1975
If you help to make the profits it shouldnt all just go to the executives and the shareholders, 1975, 1993
You should be able to share in that." "Now theres a lot we can do, 1993, 2008
And people say Well how are you going to pay for it? Well Im going to go where the money is, 2008, 2029
And all the money is going to the wealthiest in our country, 2029, 2041
I have made a pledge and you can hold me to it, 2041, 2053
I will not raise taxes on the middle class, 2053, 2062
Nobody who is working hard to get ahead should be asked to pay more in taxes when we have so many people who have done so well and are not paying their fair share." "Now Donald Trump is the poster child for this, 2062, 2105
Last night he finally admitted he hasnt paid a dime in federal income tax for years, 2105, 2121
Now he claims thats because back in the early 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars running casinos, 2121, 2139
Who loses money running casinos? Really, 2139, 2145
Now one of his supporters said Well the fact that he lost a billion dollars and that meant he didnt have to pay taxes made him a genius, 2145, 2173
Well I guess you do have to be a genius to lose a billion dollars in a year, 2173, 2191
But Ill tell you what, 2191, 2196
What that meant was he paid zero zero for the military zero for our vets zero for Pell Grants to help a lot of you afford college and get through college." "And then he did something that in retrospect seemed both odd and not very smart, 2196, 2242
He brought in Warren Buffett, 2242, 2247
He said Well everybody does this, 2247, 2253
Warren Buffett does this." "So Warren Buffett who by the way is a real billionaire Warren Buffett heard that pretty hard to miss, 2253, 2276
And so he put out a statement today, 2276, 2284
And heres what he said, 2284, 2289
He said I have paid federal income tax every year since 1944 when I was 13, 2289, 2305
He said I have copies of all 72 of my returns, 2305, 2316
And none uses a carryforward, 2316, 2321
That was the gimmick Trump used to avoid paying his fair share, 2321, 2333
And then Warren Buffett ends by saying Finally I have been audited by the IRS multiple times and am currently being audited, 2333, 2355
I have no problem releasing my tax information while under audit, 2355, 2366
Neither would Mr, 2366, 2369
Trump, 2369, 2370
At least he would have no legal problem in doing so, 2370, 2381
Well if you take a shot at Warren Buffett youd better be prepared." "And in fact Warren Buffett actually agrees with me that wealthy people ought to pay more, 2381, 2410
He says no person in his fortunate position in life should be paying a lower tax rate than people who work for him, 2410, 2433
And he has proposed whats called the Buffett rule and I am absolutely behind that and Ive said thats one of the changes I want – so that the wealthy have to pay their fair share." "Now there was a lot about last night that was hard to believe, 2433, 2482
And so dont, 2482, 2485
But one of the things that really struck me was he had not answer, 2485, 2499
You know hes not usually tongue-tied but he had no answer when confronted about the report that hes been buying cheap Chinese steel for his construction projects instead of American-made steel that supports good American jobs, 2499, 2535
Now I know youve seen reports and youve probably seen a lot of the visuals coming out of his rallies, 2535, 2555
Hes had a lot of them across Ohio, 2555, 2563
He claims to be on the side of workers, 2563, 2572
He especially likes to talk about how he supports American steelworkers, 2572, 2583
He even had the nerve – this is what kills me about him – he even had the nerve to brag about how American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring, 2583, 2613
And the whole time he was hiding the truth, 2613, 2622
Hiding the fact that he chose to buy illegally-dumped Chinese steel instead of American steel." "You know when China illegally floods our market with steel at below-price and people like Trump buy it that kills jobs, 2622, 2658
It kills jobs in this state including right here in Columbus, 2658, 2669
This May Columbus Castings the biggest single-site foundry in America just seven miles from where we are tonight filed for bankruptcy and announced that 800 workers would be laid off, 2669, 2699
Now when I think of that and I think of the way Trump has been playing people it really – it really gets me upset, 2699, 2724
Theres no justification for it, 2724, 2729
But it fits him to a T, 2729, 2736
For all his talk about putting America first hes made his products in at least 12 other countries, 2736, 2754
Trumps suits and ties were made in Mexico and China, 2754, 2764
They could have been made right here in Ohio, 2764, 2773
In fact he could have made his ties three miles from the Trump Tower in New York." "So weve got to figure out how we have an economy that really does produce growth and rewards companies that do the right thing, 2773, 2814
And that for me means we need to have a tax system that rewards investment in our country investment in workers investment in plant and equipment investment in research and development and give the good guys a chance to get ahead instead of being taken advantage of by Wall Street and others." "We are going to end the cowboy culture on Wall Street and what happens in too many boardrooms, 2814, 2884
Were going to defend the tough new rules on Wall Street that President Obama got passed the Dodd-Frank rules, 2884, 2903
Trump wants to do away with those, 2903, 2910
He also wants to do away with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau something that was designed and created by my friend Senator Elizabeth Warren to protect consumers, 2910, 2937
He wants to do away with that, 2937, 2944
And yet he claims to be on the side of working people and the middle class." "Well were going to crack down on corporate fraud like weve seen at Wells Fargo, 2944, 2975
Were going to crack down to make sure that Wall Street can never wreck Main Street again, 2975, 2992
And were going to do it in part by imposing some penalties on companies that try to pick up and leave America, 2992, 3014
If they try to leave were going to slap an exit tax on them and make them pay back every single penny they ever got in tax benefits from anybody in America." "Were also going to end the carried interest loophole, 3014, 3055
Ive been trying to get that done for years, 3055, 3064
Were going to get it done, 3064, 3070
Weve got a couple of different ways of doing it, 3070, 3080
I hope that Congress along with us but if they dont were going to figure out a way to finally put an end to what is one of the most unfair parts of the whole tax code hedge fund managers and others paying a lower tax rate not for investing but just for moving money around, 3080, 3136
Thats going to end, 3136, 3140
I want to reward the productive economy, 3140, 3147
I dont want to keep rewarding the financial economy, 3147, 3156
That is not the way were going to grow new businesses and create new opportunities and more jobs for Americans." "Now people in Ohio often ask about Well what are we going to do about trade? Well were going to have smart and fair trade, 3156, 3201
Thats what I love about your Senator Sherrod Brown, 3201, 3210
He is one of the best advocates for the kind of trade deals we should have, 3210, 3226
Look, 3226, 3227
Weve got to trade with the rest of the world, 3227, 3237
Were only 5 percent of the population of the world, 3237, 3247
Weve got to trade with the other 95 percent, 3247, 3256
When I was Secretary of State we really bore down on this and we increased American exports 30 percent and in particular 50 percent to China because we stood behind every American business, 3256, 3289
We helped them knock down every barrier so that they could get into those markets and sell." "And Ive gone toe-to-toe with the Chinese over trade, 3289, 3315
They have tried to slap unfair tariffs and prevent American companies from doing business without having to pay some kind of big fine or make some big deal, 3315, 3343
So were going to stand up, 3343, 3349
Im going to have a trade prosecutor who will report directly to me to make sure every trade deal were already in is absolutely followed to the letter so nobody takes advantage of us." "And Ive always had three tests for trade deals: Does it create American jobs? Does it raise American incomes? is it good for our national security? And when it comes to the Trans-Pacific Partnership the TPP it fails my tests, 3349, 3423
Once it was finally negotiated I dont think it will do what I want it to do so I oppose it, 3423, 3444
I oppose TPP now, 3444, 3448
Ill oppose it after the election, 3448, 3454
Ill oppose it as president, 3454, 3459
But Im going to keep fighting to open markets so that we can get more jobs and rising incomes by exporting into those markets and doing business with the rest of the world." "I also saw a sign or a t-shirt out here about Social Security, 3459, 3505
And that may not always be something that people on a great university campus think about but Ill tell you what, 3505, 3526
I am never going to let anybody privatize Social Security, 3526, 3536
That is off the table forever." "So lets say yes to good jobs but heres what else we need to say yes to, 3536, 3559
Lets say yes to good education from preschool all the way through college and university, 3559, 3574
I want every kid to be able to attend this great university to do well, 3574, 3589
And for a lot of kids theyre not prepared when they get to kindergarten and first grade, 3589, 3606
Theres an achievement gap already, 3606, 3611
Theres also a digital gap; we have five million homes mostly poor homes without access to the internet so theyre behind, 3611, 3632
I want this to be a true meritocracy, 3632, 3640
Im tired of inequality, 3640, 3644
I want people to feel like they can get ahead if they work for it." So I want to have universal pre-kindergarten so every child can be prepared to be successful, 3644, 3675
I want good schools and good teachers in every zip code so every child has the best possible public education, 3675, 3695
And I think we made a mistake when we took what used to be called vocational education out of high school, 3695, 3716
We need technical education for more young people, 3716, 3724
Not everybody needs to or wants to go to a four-year college but everybody should have the opportunity to get the skills that he or she needs to get ahead and be successful, 3724, 3757
I want us to have our community colleges working with our high schools and our businesses, 3757, 3773
We have a lot of job openings for machinists and tool and die markers for coders for all kinds of skills, 3773, 3794
"And then when it comes to college I want everybody who goes to a public college or university to understand what I am proposing that is a joint proposal from Senator Sanders and myself, 3794, 3828
We both remember that college was affordable, 3828, 3835
And it isnt for a lot of people now and a lot of states have disinvested in their great public colleges and universities, 3835, 3858
So here is our proposal." "We want anyone from a family that makes less than $125000 a year to go to Ohio State University tuition-free, 3858, 3883
And for families over that line we want you to go debt-free, 3883, 3895
So yes you pay what you can afford but you dont have to go into debt to go to Ohio State, 3895, 3916
And Ill tell you the other big problem – how many of you already have student debt? Oh wow, 3916, 3935
Practically every hand, 3935, 3938
Well heres what were going to do, 3938, 3945
Were going to make it possible for you to refinance that debt, 3945, 3957
If you can refinance your home mortgage your car payment or if Donald can refinance his airplane you ought to be able to refinance your student debt." "And then we want you to pay it back as a percentage of the income you make and have a limit on that 10 percent so that – I feel personally about this because thats what I did after law school, 3957, 4025
My dad was a small businessman and he really was a saver, 4025, 4037
He didnt even have a credit card, 4037, 4044
Didnt believe in that, 4044, 4048
So he saved the money for me to go to college, 4048, 4059
I had to work if I wanted to buy a book but that was okay, 4059, 4074
That was the arrangement, 4074, 4078
And then I told him I wanted to go to law school, 4078, 4090
He said Youre on your own, 4090, 4096
I dont have any money for that, 4096, 4103
So I worked I got a small scholarship and I took out loans, 4103, 4116
But boy was I lucky because I got into one of the earliest income repayment programs, 4116, 4132
In other words when I got out of law school I could go to work for the Childrens Defense Fund and make I dont know $14000 a year because I could pay it back as a percentage of my income not on an interest rate of 8 10 12 percent like I see from young people across America." "So thats what I want but I also want to make it possible if you do public service or national service to have a lot of your loan and maybe all of it forgiven because youre going to be paying back to our country, 4132, 4234
And Ive got this idea about something Im calling the National Service Reserve, 4234, 4247
Its kind of like if any of you have ever been in the military reserve, 4247, 4262
You get the training and youre kind of on call and you practice and train, 4262, 4277
And then if youre needed youre called up, 4277, 4285
I want a civilian national reserve and I want people of all ages in it, 4285, 4300
And we would train you so that if theres a natural disaster or some other problem that has to be dealt with we could call you up to go do that, 4300, 4331
And its a way of making sure that people are giving back all the time to this country because thats how we build solidarity, 4331, 4355
Thats how we get to know each other better." "So Im pretty excited about what were going to do together, 4355, 4375
And I cant do any of this without your help, 4375, 4385
I really am asking you to do everything you can to make sure youre registered to tell your friends and anybody else you can talk to make sure theyre registered, 4385, 4415
As I said go to iwillvote.com, 4415, 4421
You can find it out right there on that site, 4421, 4431
And wed love to have you be involved in the campaign because I know that if we win in November we can summon the positive spirit of our country back again, 4431, 4462
I think I have to do everything everything in my power to bring people together and I will." "Its really important to me that you know that I want to be your president whether you vote for me or not, 4462, 4502
Obviously I hope you do but I will be your president and I will stand up for you and I will work for you and I will fight for you, 4502, 4532
