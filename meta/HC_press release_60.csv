"When the Supreme Court decided Roe v, 18, 25
Wade on January 22 1973 it recognized that the U.S, 25, 35
Constitution protects a womans right to safe and legal abortion, 35, 45
Its a decision that has withstood 43 years of politically motivated attacks in the courts in Congress by state legislatures and at the hands of violent extremists." Thanks to  " more than four decades of women have had the right to make the most fundamental decisions about their lives families and futures, 45, 97
This is about womens health and womens rights—and the fight for reproductive rights is also a fight for economic opportunity." "Today on the 43rd anniversary of the Courts decision the future of reproductive rights in America is more vulnerable than ever before, 97, 139

"Over the past five years states have enacted 288 abortion restrictions (and counting), 169, 182
Thats more than the previous 15 years combined." "These restrictions—which keep abortion access out of reach for many women and even shutter clinics altogether—undermine womens fundamental rights and health." "Lets be very clear about one thing: The onslaught of attacks on these rights is not a coincidence; its part of a deliberate strategy to chip away at the right to abortion altogether until the Supreme Court has the chance to eviscerate the decision." That may come sooner than you think: An abortion case the Court will hear later this year from Texas   is the biggest challenge to  " weve seen in a generation—one that would be devastating to women in Texas and could significantly affect reproductive rights across the country." "This is whats at stake in the 2016 election, 182, 311
When the next president takes the oath of office next January three of our current Supreme Court justices will be 80 or older—already older than the average justice retirement age, 311, 341

We need someone in the White House who will fight for women who will build on the progress weve made over the past four decades—and who will keep going, 434, 463
We need Hillary Clinton." Our reproductive rights are by no means "established." We fight for them every day, 463, 481
Womens health clinics doctors and advocates have been the targets of arson shootings and blockades for decades, 481, 498
And just last year: And we still have laws on the books like the Hyde Amendment which makes it harder for low-income women—and low-income women of color in particular—to exercise their full reproductive rights, 498, 532
Hillary will fight to repeal it as president, 532, 540
We need a leader who understands that a fight for reproductive rights is also a fight for economic opportunity, 540, 559
