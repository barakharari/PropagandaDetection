"Good evening, 0, 2
Thank you very much, 2, 6
I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel, 6, 20
Im a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state." In 2001 weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly the attacks on all of us attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims, 20, 75
I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent, 75, 88
"In spring of 2004 at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state, 88, 124
It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel, 124, 138
Many people turned down this honor; I did not, 138, 147
I took the risk and Im glad I did." "But I didnt come here tonight to pander to you about Israel, 147, 168
Thats what politicians do all talk no action believe me, 168, 178
I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother the only democracy in the Middle East the State of Israel." Thank you, 178, 219
My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran, 219, 231
Thank you, 231, 233
I have been in business a long time I know deal making and let me tell you this deal is catastrophic for America for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East, 233, 266
"The problem here is fundamental, 266, 271
Weve rewarded the worlds leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return, 271, 291
Ive studied this issue in great detail, 291, 298
I would say actually greater by far than anybody else believe me oh believe me." "And its a bad deal, 298, 318
The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it because already as you know it has, 318, 341
The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock, 341, 362
And of course theyll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them." "The deal doesnt even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability, 362, 393
Yes it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years but when those restrictions expire Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Irans behavior is, 393, 438
Terrible terrible situation that we are all placed in and especially Israel." "When Im president I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran, 438, 468
First we will stand up to Irans aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region." "Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be but if Im not elected president I know how to deal with trouble and believe me thats why Im going to be elected president folks, 468, 519
And we are leading in every poll remember that please." "Iran is a problem in Iraq a problem in Syria a problem in Lebanon a problem in Yemen and will be a very very major problem for Saudi Arabia, 519, 558
Literally every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states Hezbollah Lebanon received and Ill tell you what it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have." "Now theyre in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights, 558, 626
In Gaza Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, 626, 635
And in the West Bank theyre openly offering Palestinians 7000 dollars per terror attack and 30000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home thats been destroyed a deplorable deplorable situation." "Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and its absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror." "Secondly we will totally dismantle Irans global terror network which is big and powerful but not powerful like us." "Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world, 635, 724
During the last five years Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents, 724, 741
Theyve got terror cells everywhere including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home, 741, 755
Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach believe me believe me." "Third at the very least we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like youve never seen a contract enforced before folks believe me." "Iran has already since the deal is in place test-fired ballistic missiles three times, 755, 826
Those ballistic missiles with a range of 1250 miles were designed to intimidate not only Israel which is only 600 miles away but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and were not going to let that happen were not letting it happen and were not letting it happen to Israel believe me." Thank you, 826, 887
Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words "Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth." You can forget that, 887, 931
"What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And heres another, 931, 943
You talk about twisted heres another twisted part, 943, 951
Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that weve made, 951, 964
The deal is silent on test missiles but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions, 964, 982
The problem is no one has done anything about it, 982, 992
We will I promise we will." "Thank you, 992, 1000
Which brings me to my next point the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations, 1000, 1016
The United Nations is not a friend of democracy its not a friend to freedom its not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel." With President Obama in his final year yay he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel believe me believe me and you know it better than anybody, 1016, 1088
So with the president in his final year discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine, 1088, 1119
Let me be clear an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster, 1119, 1137
The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto which I will use as president 100 percent, 1137, 1159
"When people ask why its because thats not how you make a deal, 1159, 1172
Deals are made when parties come together they come to a table and they negotiate, 1172, 1187
Each side must give up something its values, 1187, 1195
I mean we have to do something where theres value in exchange for something that it requires, 1195, 1212
Thats what a deal is." "A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine we bring together a group of people that come up with something, 1212, 1243
Thats not going to happen with the United Nations, 1243, 1252
It will only further very importantly it will only further delegitimize Israel, 1252, 1264
It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel, 1264, 1274
Its not going to happen folks." "And further it would reward Palestinian terrorism because every day theyre stabbing Israelis and even Americans, 1274, 1296
Just last week American Taylor Allen Force a West Point grad phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian, 1296, 1325
You dont reward behavior like that, 1325, 1331
You cannot do it, 1331, 1335
Theres only one way you treat that kind of behavior, 1335, 1345
You have to confront it." "So its not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution, 1345, 1364
Its really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves, 1364, 1374
They have no choice they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway, 1374, 1391
The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that dont even really know whats happening to Israel to anything in the area, 1391, 1437
Its so preposterous, 1437, 1440
Were not going to let that happen." "When Im president believe me I will veto any attempt by the U.N, 1440, 1460
to impose its will on the Jewish state, 1460, 1468
It will be vetoed 100 percent." You see I know about deal making thats what I do, 1468, 1485
I wrote the Art of the Deal, 1485, 1492
One of the bestselling all-time and I mean seriously Im saying "one of" because Ill be criticized if I say "the" so Im going to be very diplomatic "one of" Ill be criticized I think it is number one but why take a chance, 1492, 1536
One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making, 1536, 1547
To make a great deal you need two willing participants, 1547, 1557
We know Israel is willing to deal, 1557, 1564
Israel has been trying, 1564, 1568
"Thats right, 1568, 1570
Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years, 1570, 1585
You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it, 1585, 1606
In 2008 Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also." "Then John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didnt even respond not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America, 1606, 1650
They didnt even respond, 1650, 1654
When I become president the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one." Thank you, 1654, 1674
And when I say something I mean it, 1674, 1682
"I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately, 1682, 1690
I have known him for many years and well be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region, 1690, 1718
Meanwhile every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews, 1718, 1738
It has to stop." "When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes little kids want to be firefighters, 1738, 1760
When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes little kids want to be athletes and movie stars, 1760, 1783
In Palestinian society the heroes are those who murder Jews, 1783, 1793
We cant let this continue, 1793, 1798
We cant let this happen any longer." "You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs, 1798, 1815
Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace, 1815, 1823
It is a horrible way to think, 1823, 1830
Its a barrier that cant be broken, 1830, 1837
That will end and itll end soon believe me, 1837, 1846
In Palestinian textbooks and mosques youve got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace theyve got to go out and theyve got to start sic this educational process, 1846, 1885
They have to end education of hatred, 1885, 1892
They have to end it and now." There is no moral equivalency, 1892, 1904
Israel does not name public squares after terrorists, 1904, 1912
Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians, 1912, 1922
You see what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies, 1922, 1945
And you see that happening all the time that pattern practiced by the president and his administration including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster by the way, 1945, 1977
She and President Obama have treated Israel very very badly, 1977, 1987
"But its repeated itself over and over again and its done nothing to embolden those who hate America, 1987, 2005
We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community, 2005, 2027
It didnt happen." "President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue but its precisely the opposite that happens, 2027, 2049
Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half, 2049, 2076
So its a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States, 2076, 2099
Well get it solved one way or the other, 2099, 2108
We will get it solved." "But when the United States stands with Israel the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially, 2108, 2130
Thats what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States." We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people Jerusalem, 2130, 2158
And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally the State of Israel, 2158, 2181
The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable, 2181, 2202
They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel, 2202, 2223
They must do that, 2223, 2227
And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state, 2227, 2252
"I love the people in this room, 2252, 2259
I love Israel, 2259, 2262
I love Israel, 2262, 2265
Ive been with Israel so long in terms of Ive received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me incredible, 2265, 2288
My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby, 2288, 2299
In fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as Im concerned." So I want to thank you very much this has been a truly great honor, 2299, 2332
Thank you everybody, 2332, 2335
Thank you, 2335, 2337
Thank you very much, 2337, 2341
