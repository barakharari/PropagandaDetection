"Thank you! Wow! Hello Akron! Wow! I am so excited! Its just fabulous being back here again, 0, 17
I am so grateful to all of you, 17, 25
I want to thank your mayor Mayor Horrigan, 25, 33
Thank you for welcoming me here, 33, 39
I want to thank two great members of Congress who fight for Akron fight for Cleveland fight for Youngstown fight for Ohio and America Congresswoman Marcia Fudge and Congressman Tim Ryan, 39, 70
"Now Im pretty excited about being here today, 70, 78
And I was especially honored to receive the endorsement of LeBron James, 78, 90
Now I may become president but he will be king of Ohio for as long as there is a king, 90, 110
Im obviously delighted to be endorsed by someone who has demonstrated such leadership and such extraordinary ability, 110, 127
But Ill tell you what really moved me the most is hes given back to his hometown, 127, 144
He has advocated for small businesses for kids giving kids more opportunities, 144, 156
Hes spoken out on behalf of criminal justice reform, 156, 165
He is someone who uses the platform he has earned because he has worked so hard over so many years to speak out and speak up for those who may not have a voice, 165, 199
So I am truly honored to have his support and especially to be able to tell people in his hometown how I am looking forward not just to watch him play basketball but to continue to be a leader in so many different ways." "Now we do have an important election coming up, 199, 252
Who here is planning to vote? Well that is very good news because this is the most consequential election I think in our lifetimes, 252, 276
The choice could not be clearer and we need everybody to show up, 276, 289
And how many of you still have to register to be able to vote? Everybody here registered? Well I want you to talk to your friends because the deadline for registering in Ohio is October 11th, 289, 325
Thats just a little over a week away, 325, 333
And if youre not sure whether or not someone you know is registered or maybe you yourself want to be absolutely positive you can go to iwillvote.com – see that sign over there? You can go to iwillvote.com and confirm your registration and register if you need to." "So lets get everybody you know to register and maybe start voting when early voting starts on October the 12th because we have just 36 days left, 333, 408
Thirty-six days now we are reaching out, 408, 415
Were making phone calls, 415, 419
Were knocking on doors, 419, 423
If you want to get involved you can go to my website hillaryclinton.com, 423, 436
Sign up to be part of this campaign in the next 36 days, 436, 449
You can text join j-o-i-n at 47246 and get involved because we are running to win Ohio in this election." "And everybody everybody in the campaign is crisscrossing Ohio, 449, 478
My daughters been here a bunch, 478, 484
Tim Kaine and his wonderful wife Anne have been here, 484, 494
My husbands coming back tomorrow for a two-day bus tour through Ohio, 494, 506
And I will be back because we care about Ohio and we want to make sure Ohio makes the best choice for the future of the people of this great state." "Now Im going to close this campaign the way that I started my career a long time ago fighting for kids and families standing up for people who may need a little extra boost in life making sure that this country delivers on the promise of the American dream, 506, 586
See I believe the American dream is big enough for everybody, 586, 597
If youre willing to work for it and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead in America." "Now my opponent and I have a really different view about what it takes to get ahead and stay ahead and that may be because we have very different life experiences, 597, 651
And thats okay, 651, 654
People have different families different views of the world, 654, 663
But heres what I have noticed, 663, 669
I have noticed that he always puts himself first, 669, 678
And maybe thats because he was born into a millionaire family, 678, 689
He started his business with a $14 million loan from his father, 689, 701
His father bailed him out; apparently thats a pattern you got to be bailed out when you do business with him, 701, 722
And he then has taken advantage of every single element of our tax code of our economy that he could." "And along the way along the way he has stiffed people – small businesses and workers and contractors, 722, 760
And thats part of the reason I take this election so seriously, 760, 772
My dad was a small businessman, 772, 778
My grandfather was a factory worker, 778, 784
And so my dad when he got out of the Navy in World War II he started a small business, 784, 804
He started a printing business, 804, 809
He printed fabrics for draperies, 809, 814
And he worked really hard, 814, 819
He had a print plant in Chicago – no natural light no windows just a long room where there were two big long tables and the fabric would be laid out on them, 819, 852
And then if youve ever seen silkscreens thats what he did, 852, 863
You take the silkscreen, 863, 867
You put it down, 867, 871
You pour the paint in, 871, 876
You take the squeegee, 876, 880
You go across, 880, 883
You lift it up, 883, 887
You go down to the end of one long table you start on the end of the other long table, 887, 907
And then if it was going to be two colors you would add another color doing exactly the same thing, 907, 927
It was before there was machines, 927, 933
My dad couldnt have afforded that anyway, 933, 940
But he worked really hard and he produced a good middle class life for our family." "And so when I think about the way that my opponent has taken advantage of people I got to tell you I am really grateful my dad never got a contract from him because I have met people he stiffed, 940, 996
I have met people, 996, 1000
Im talking painters and plumbers, 1000, 1005
Im talking dishwashers marble installers glass installers architects a man who sold him pianos for one of his casinos, 1005, 1024
He wouldnt pay them, 1024, 1028
Now you got to stop and ask yourself what kind of person does that? Somebody who works hard and has a contract which they expect to be honored." "And so I met one of the men, 1028, 1064
I met a man who had a small family business installed the glass in one of those casinos submitted the bill and Trump said no, 1064, 1089
were not going to pay it, 1089, 1095
And the man was stunned as so many hundreds and hundreds of people have been, 1095, 1110
And then they come back the Trump organization or Trump himself and say okay well give you 10 cents 20 cents maybe 30 cents on the dollar, 1110, 1137
Now some of those small businesses they couldnt afford that, 1137, 1147
They had bought the material They had provided the services, 1147, 1157
Trump didnt care, 1157, 1160
He basically just walked away from them made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work theyd been asked to provide, 1160, 1186
I got to tell you that is not the way were supposed to do business in America, 1186, 1203
And I cant imagine having a president who believes that thats the way youre supposed to treat people, 1203, 1221
But youre going to help me make sure he never gets near the White House." "Now earlier today earlier today in Toledo I talked about all of the changes I want to make in how we can protect Americans from the kind of corporate fraud that we have seen too much of, 1221, 1273
Now the most recent example is Wells Fargo, 1273, 1281
Wells Fargo actually had people thousands of their employees putting customers into accounts they either never asked for or they did not understand, 1281, 1304
And then every time they put somebody into a new account they got fees which then gave them the chance to get a bigger bonus – a really crummy game that hurt people, 1304, 1337
So thankfully we have an organization now the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau in Washington who looks out for people who get ..., 1337, 1359
That is an important part of how were going to protect, 1359, 1370
And its run you may know by Richard Cordray from Ohio." "Now will it surprise you that Donald Trump wants to eliminate that agency? Well were not going to let that happen, 1370, 1402
That agency has already recovered $11 billion for consumers whove been taken advantage of by corporations, 1402, 1418
And the behavior of Wells Fargo shows clearly that we have got to keep the pressure on these big banks so they can never wreck the economy again the way they did back in 2008." "I have said were never going to let Wall Street wreck Main Street again and I mean it, 1418, 1471
Contrast that – contrast that with my opponent, 1471, 1479
He wants to do away with the rules that have been imposed on Wall Street, 1479, 1494
He basically wants to let Wall Street the banks the hedge funds all these other institutions basically do whatever they want again, 1494, 1516
Well Ill tell you what were not going to let that happen, 1516, 1528
We need more rules not fewer rules on them." I want us to make it easier to start a small business to get rid of the red tape to make credit available to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America so we should have a big dynamic small business economy, 1528, 1587
But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore, 1587, 1603
That is not working for us, 1603, 1609
"But Trumps whole economic vision is really trickle-down economics, 1609, 1618
Its the same – the same idea that has failed us before, 1618, 1630
You see he believes that all you do is cut taxes on the wealthy and then it trickles down, 1630, 1649
Well we know that doesnt work, 1649, 1655
Weve been down that road, 1655, 1660
And what he wants to do is I think its fair to say trickle-down on steroids, 1660, 1676
What he has proposed would slash taxes on the wealthy." "Now Im a little confused about this because for a long time weve been saying Hey where are your tax returns? A lot of us wondered what he was hiding, 1676, 1716
Because you know if it was something that would make him look good he would put them right out there, 1716, 1736
Everybody whos ever run for president in at least the last 40 years has released their tax returns, 1736, 1754
My husband and I have about 40 years of tax returns out there, 1754, 1767
You can go and look at them and you can see that we paid a lot of taxes and frankly we were grateful we could, 1767, 1792
We are grateful for the blessings that weve had over the last 15 years." "So did any of you see the debate last Monday? Well I raised it, 1792, 1820
I said Well maybe he doesnt want us to see that he owes hundreds of millions of dollars to foreign banks and foreign lenders or maybe he hasnt paid any taxes, 1820, 1851
Now shortly after the debate it was discovered that indeed back in the 1990s he apparently lost a billion dollars on bad investments and failing casinos, 1851, 1877
Ask yourself this: Who loses money on casinos? Really, 1877, 1886
And yesterday some of his supporters said Well it just shows hes a genius that he didnt pay any taxes, 1886, 1906
Well what kind of genius loses a billion dollars in the first place?" "In the debate he said not paying taxes made him smart, 1906, 1930
But think about what that means, 1930, 1936
It means that all the rest of us who pay our taxes right – whats he saying about us? But more than that zero taxes means zero for our vets zero for our military zero for Pell Grants to send young people to college zero for health zero for education, 1936, 1986
And you stop and ask yourself this is the same person whos been going around really just dumping on America, 1986, 2006
He says our militarys a disaster, 2006, 2012
Well he could not be more wrong but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us." "Today in Colorado he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes, 2012, 2056
Well that just shows number one he is the poster boy – the poster boy – for the same rigged system that he would make even worse, 2056, 2083
Just think about it, 2083, 2087
He paid zero at least for about 20 years we believe now based on what we know, 2087, 2104
And hes advocating for huge tax cuts that would help him and his family even more, 2104, 2120
Whats he want us to do pay him to lose money? Really?" "Theres a lot more to this story and were just slowly getting it into the public eye, 2120, 2149
So we know hes stiffed people didnt pay his bills, 2149, 2159
We know he took bankruptcy depending on how you count four or six times, 2159, 2173
You know that he paid no taxes for probably 20 years, 2173, 2184
We dont know what his taxes would be after that, 2184, 2194
Hes always talked about how he cant release his taxes because hes under audit but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit so Donald release everything up until 2009, 2194, 2225
Show the American people your taxes." "Ill tell you another thing, 2225, 2236
If Im fortunate enough to be president were going to pass a law requiring anybody who is a nominee of a major national party to have to release their taxes." So what did we find out today? Well a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects, 2236, 2297
So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs he once again stiffed us, 2297, 2326
He sent that money overseas, 2326, 2331
Now he spends a lot of time bashing the Chinese right? You hear that all the time when he talks, 2331, 2351
Well it turns out he bought his steel and aluminum from the Chinese, 2351, 2364
It turns out he owes big money to the Chinese, 2364, 2374
So this is another one of the episodes of his reality television show where he is saying one thing and doing something else, 2374, 2397
"Now for years China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets, 2397, 2418
You know that right? And it sounds like Donald Trump has been buying that dumped steel and aluminum, 2418, 2436
How can he make America great again when he wont even buy American products in our country?" "And Ill tell you this is personal to me because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented, 2436, 2484
And as Secretary of State I went toe-to-toe with the Chinese, 2484, 2495
I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China to stand up for American workers and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum." "And today in Toledo I pointed out because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler – about 700 more jobs right? I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job – more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here – Donald Trump said he didnt care, 2495, 2606
Save it dont save it; didnt matter to him." "Well Ill tell you where I stood, 2606, 2622
I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry, 2622, 2632
And look what we got, 2632, 2637
Last year our auto industry had the best year theyve had in a really long time, 2637, 2653
And so weve got to keep building it, 2653, 2661
Weve got to keep making sure that there are good jobs, 2661, 2672
And weve got to protect good union jobs against the kind of assault that is coming from all sides." "So now I know that Ohio is a tough tough state, 2672, 2702
Youve got to get out there, 2702, 2708
Youve got to talk to people answer questions make your case, 2708, 2719
Thats what weve been doing, 2719, 2724
Thats what were going to do all the way to the end of this election, 2724, 2739
But I need your help to talk to anybody you know here who thinks they might be voting for Trump, 2739, 2759
I know you know people, 2759, 2764
I know you do, 2764, 2768
And youve got to stage an intervention, 2768, 2775
Youve got to sit them down and point out how everything he says he wants to do is absolutely opposite of what he has done and how everything he has proposed will help people like him and his family but not the vast majority of families in Ohio, 2775, 2823
In fact if you look at his tax proposals they benefit him and other wealthy people – hedge fund managers and the like and they would actually raise taxes on middle-class families." "Now thats the kind of contrast were getting out in the campaign but thats why we need your help – to make sure you go out and talk to everybody, 2823, 2885
And I know people want change, 2885, 2891
Thats part of the American dynamic spirit, 2891, 2898
We want change, 2898, 2901
Well Ill tell you one thing that is certain is well have change – its just what kind of change, 2901, 2921
Its whether or not we have change that helps the vast majority of Americans hardworking Americans middle-class families or continues to only help those at the top, 2921, 2948
I want an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top, 2948, 2962
And thats exactly what were going to fight for and that is what were going to get." "Ill tell you Ive been called a lot of things, 2962, 2989
Right? Ive never been called quitter, 2989, 2995
If I tell you Im going to get up every day and fight for you that is exactly what I will do." "But I know I cant do it – I cant do it alone, 2995, 3030
Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America, 3030, 3051
And then he said I alone can fix it, 3051, 3060
He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship, 3060, 3067
He has a hard time remembering who our friends are and who our adversaries are, 3067, 3082
He has a weird fascination with dictators like Vladimir Putin, 3082, 3092
We have a lot of people living in this part of Ohio who either themselves or their parents or grandparents came from countries that were under the yoke of oppression and were never going to let that happen again." "And so when Trump basically signs up for Putins wish list thats bad enough, 3092, 3145
But then when hes cavalier – and Im not talking about basketball – when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons saying that oh he doesnt care if other countries get them; in fact you know if there were a nuclear war in East Asia if Japan got nuclear weapons if South Korea got nuclear weapons hey just go at it folks, 3145, 3206
He even said he wouldnt care if Saudi Arabia got nuclear weapons, 3206, 3218
One thing that has been a bedrock of American foreign policy through Democratic and Republican presidents going back to the dawn of the atomic age is we were committed to trying to keep other countries from getting access to nuclear weapons to be able to stop proliferation, 3218, 3265
And now its even more important because its not only states that we have to worry about like North Korea; weve got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons, 3265, 3297
The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesnt matter because it does." "I was involved in putting together the sanctions against Iran that drove them to the negotiating table, 3297, 3331
And what I learned – if you use diplomacy and youre tough about it you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program, 3331, 3359
And were going to make sure they follow it to the period the comma everything in that agreement, 3359, 3377
Im going to enforce, 3377, 3381
And we still have challenges with Iran but I think were in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections." "So I know diplomacy can work because Ive done it and I know that – we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air takes them out on the ground and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people, 3381, 3477
Ive been laying out my plan for what I think it will take to defeat ISIS and I have no doubt we will, 3477, 3500
And Donald says he has a secret plan, 3500, 3508
That he wont tell us about, 3508, 3514
Well theres no secret; he has no plan." "And weve got to do more – weve got to do more to make sure we protect our country, 3514, 3541
We need the best intelligence we can get the best cooperation among law enforcement at all levels of government, 3541, 3560
I will not rest, 3560, 3564
As a former Senator from New York on 9/11 I take this as a personal responsibility, 3564, 3580
I will do everything I can to keep our country safe and to work with others to defeat the threat posed by terrorism." "And finally my friends weve got to bring our country back together, 3580, 3615
There is too much divisiveness too much finger-pointing and scapegoating, 3615, 3625
Our diversity is one of our strengths, 3625, 3632
We have to listen to each other, 3632, 3639
We dont have to agree; that is not required, 3639, 3648
But we need to be respectful, 3648, 3654
We need to listen, 3654, 3658
And then we need to roll up our sleeves and get to work." "When I was First Lady Senator Secretary of State I worked to find common ground with everybody, 3658, 3688
I worked when I was First Lady with Republicans and Democrats to create the Childrens Health Insurance Program that insures eight million kids, 3688, 3711
When I was in the Senate I worked with practically every Republican I served with, 3711, 3726
And they all have nice things to say about me when Im not running for something, 3726, 3742
And I will work again to move our country forward and to change the .., 3742, 3757
of that, 3757, 3759
And we had to get 13 Republicans and I worked tirelessly and we got them, 3759, 3774
We did that, 3774, 3777
There is a lot we can do if we start listening and respecting each other and avoid the kind of name-calling and insults that we see too much of." "So Im excited about the campaign but Im even more excited about getting to work for you – being able to get up every day and find a way to try to help somebody, 3777, 3840
I mean that is how I was raised in my church and by my family and that is what I have done through my advocacy work and my legal work on behalf of people who needed a voice, 3840, 3878
And I will do everything possible to make sure I deliver results for you, 3878, 3892
And the reason that I have published a book with my great running mate Tim Kaine – its right here – is real simple: I want you to know what we say were going to do because I want you to hold me accountable, 3892, 3936
I dont believe in bait and switch where I say oh were going to do something and then I really am over here doing something else, 3936, 3962
That kind of reminds you of somebody doesnt it? No heres what were going to try to do, 3962, 3980
Were going to pay for it by raising taxes on the wealthy and closing loopholes on corporations, 3980, 3997
And I am the only candidate who ran this whole campaign saying I will never raise taxes on the middle class, 3997, 4018
That is not going to happen when I am president." "So please join this campaign in the last 36 days, 4018, 4038
Talk to your friends, 4038, 4042
Remember friends dont let friends vote for Trump, 4042, 4050
I am motivated every day because now Im a grandmother – two beautiful grandchildren – and I think about their future I think about their lives I think about our country, 4050, 4081
I want our country to be the land of opportunity, 4081, 4091
The place where dreams do come true if youre willing to work for them, 4091, 4105
Not just for my grandchildren but for every child, 4105, 4114
I want every child in this country to have a chance to live up to his or her God-given potential, 4114, 4134
And if you will help me win this election and then help me work to make it come true we will have a country that delivers on our dreams and a future we can all be proud of." Thank you and God bless you!" , 4134, 4178
