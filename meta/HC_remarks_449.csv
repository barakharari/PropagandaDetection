"I am so excited to be here and I want to thank you, 0, 13
And you know I am really sorry and I know there are a lot of people outdoors who cant get in—so I want to give a big shout out to the overflow outside, 13, 46
Im here with a lot of great people who are working so hard on this campaign, 46, 62
I want to thank Ken Evans, 62, 68
Thank you so much Ken, 68, 73
I want to thank three members of Congress: Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz; Congressman Alcee Hastings; and your Congresswoman Lois Frankel, 73, 93
I also want to thank Sheriff Israel for being here, 93, 103
And Mayor Resnick just gave me a key to the city of Wilton Manors, 103, 117
And I want to thank my longtime friend and such a great leader Chad Griffin Human Rights Campaign president, 117, 136
I know that Chad told me there are a bunch of Human Rights Campaign organizers, 136, 151
And as Ive said many times HRC for HRC sounds good to me.n" "Well my friends just nine days left until November the 8th, 151, 175
Nine days that really will determine the outcome of the most important election of our lifetimes, 175, 191
And we cannot take anyone or anything for granted, 191, 200
Its great to be here at the Manor Complex a place that means so much to so many, 200, 218
And there have been ups and downs in all that weve gone through over the years and even in this campaign but I want you to know I am focused on one thing: you – your lives your futures, 218, 257
The problems that keep you up at night, 257, 265
Thats what Im interested in and thats what Im going to be talking about here today and throughout the next nine days.n" "Thats really what this election is about, 265, 294
Theres a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to what kind of future we want and who as our president can help us get there, 294, 323
So I want you to know – now I just have to say I know Im preaching to the choir, 323, 343
But I also through you want to talk to people who are still making up their minds believe it or not right? Because weve got a choice between a president who will bring us together keep our country safe get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top – or someone whos temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified for the job, 343, 406
You know Donald Trump is doing his best to confuse mislead and discourage the American people, 406, 422
I mean hes such a downer right? And its time for him to stop fear mongering stop distracting from whats really at stake and frankly stop disgracing our democracy, 422, 451
We cant let him get away with this.n" "But heres the good news, 451, 464
Yes America is great and we can make it greater if we work together and we set some goals, 464, 483
But we are seeing Americans coming together – Democrats Republicans independents – to reject Donald Trumps dark and divisive vision of our country, 483, 506
And its going to be really important that we make it clear to everyone in these last nine days whats at stake, 506, 528
Because I really believe the vast majority of Americans agree with us, 528, 540
We dont want a president who demeans women, 540, 548
We dont want a president who has plans to break up and deport immigrant families, 548, 563
We dont want a president who perpetrated the lie that President Obama wasnt born in America, 563, 579
We dont want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality, 579, 594
But I want you to know the energy were now seeing out in the campaign is not just about what were against its also about what were for, 594, 622
Because we also share a common vision, 622, 629
Beyond partisanship and politics its a hopeful inclusive America where everyone counts and everyone has a place right?n" "And thats exactly what Im going to be fighting for in these last nine days, 629, 662
Were going to honor people not insult them, 662, 670
Donald Trump has insulted more than half of our population, 670, 680
African Americans Latinos immigrants Muslims POWs women, 680, 687
And by what he has said so many others who believe that you have a positive future, 687, 704
I agree with that: you do, 704, 710
And I promise you this: Im going to keep working every single day for you and for the vision of America that we share.n" Now I will tell you my mom taught me to never ever quit and what does that mean? Well that means –"n  "Rise up."n  "You got it, 710, 761
You got it, 761, 764
And it also means when youre knocked down what matters is whether you get up again, 764, 780
I have been fighting for families and underdogs my entire life, 780, 791
Im not stopping now, 791, 795
Were just getting warmed up right? And we wont be distracted no matter what our opponents throw at us, 795, 814
Were not going to be knocked off course, 814, 822
We know how much this election matters and we know how many people are counting on us, 822, 839
So were going to take to heart the words of our wonderful First Lady Michelle Obama: When they go low we go high.n "Were going to keep our foot on the gas because Donald Trumps strategy is real simple, 839, 878
Theyve even said it in his campaign, 878, 885
Heres his strategy about how hes going to win: Get women to stay home, 885, 899
Get young people to stay home, 899, 905
Get people of color to stay home, 905, 912
Get the LGBT committee to say home, 912, 919
Its all part of his scorched earth campaign and it goes against everything we stand for, 919, 935
So you know how were going to stop him? By showing up with the biggest turnout in American history.n" "We need everybody to turn out and vote – women young people people of color the LGBT community Latinos African Americans Americans from all walks of life, 935, 981
Lets break every single record, 981, 986
Lets make that the story of this election, 986, 994
And heres some really good news, 994, 1000
This is amazing, 1000, 1003
More than 20 million people have already voted in this election most of those votes in the last few days 3 million of those votes from right here in Florida, 1003, 1033
Now you only see numbers like that when people are standing up for what they really believe in, 1033, 1051
So if all of you vote if your friends your family your coworkers vote if everyone you talk to between now and Election Day votes we are going to make some really big history on November the 8th.n" "And I want you not only coming out for me, 1051, 1099
I want you to reelect our members of Congress, 1099, 1108
And please elect Patrick Murphy to the Senate, 1108, 1116
And if there are still people who have doubts about the stakes in the election listen to this, 1116, 1134
Weve heard some outrageous things in this campaign, 1134, 1142
Im sure well hear more in the next nine days, 1142, 1152
But I got to tell you I was beginning to think that nothing we learned about Donald Trump could surprise me anymore.n" "But yesterday the Washington Post published a report that was truly stunning, 1152, 1186
It starts with the story of a ribbon-cutting back in 1996 for a nursery school serving children living with HIV and AIDS in New York, 1186, 1211
Now let me say this is important in part to remember, 1211, 1222
This is a story about children with HIV and AIDS, 1222, 1232
So there was a big celebration honoring the donors who had supported the nursery school and all the kids and their families for whom this was the most important thing you can imagine, 1232, 1265
Because you know back in the 90s some of you remember, 1265, 1276
Right? Children werent welcomed in school.n" "And then unannounced and uninvited guess who barges in? Donald Trump, 1276, 1293
He walks right up to the stage, 1293, 1300
He sat down in the seat that was being saved for a local developer who had made a generous donation, 1300, 1320
None of the people working for the charity knew why he was there, 1320, 1333
He wasnt a donor at all, 1333, 1339
He had never given a single dollar to help build the school, 1339, 1351
He just wanted people to think he had, 1351, 1359
So he sat on the stage through the program even posed for photographs and when it was over he got up and walked out, 1359, 1383
No explanation, 1383, 1385
No donation, 1385, 1387
Now really who does that? What kind of person does that? Really? I mean who pretends to help kids with HIV and AIDS in order to make themselves look good? Well Ill tell you: The same kind of person who would pull a bait and switch on a high school chess team.n" Back in 1997 he was principal for a day at a public school, 1387, 1452
That was a program we used to have in New York, 1452, 1463
The chess team was holding a bake sale to raise money to travel to a tournament, 1463, 1479
They were $5000 short, 1479, 1483
He walked up to them and handed them a fake million dollar bill, 1483, 1496
At first the kids and their parents were excited, 1496, 1505
Then they were devastated to learn it was a joke, 1505, 1515
So he gave them 200 bucks and drove away in his limousine, 1515, 1527
Now this story does have a happy ending because a woman read the story about Donald Trumps behavior called the school and donated the $5000, 1527, 1552
And the coach remembers this woman saying "I am ashamed to be the same species as this man."n "Now I got to say any of you see the debates? Well you know I stood next to Donald Trump in three debates for four and a half hours proving conclusively I have the stamina to do this job, 1552, 1609
Right? But a lot of what weve heard him say is part of a lifelong pattern, 1609, 1625
And heres what the Washington Post concludes, 1625, 1632
For as long as he has been rich and famous he has wanted people to believe he is generous, 1632, 1651
He spent years constructing an image as a philanthropist by appearing at charity events and by making very public even nationally televised promises to give his own money away, 1651, 1680
It was in large part a façade, 1680, 1687
And a months-long investigation by the Washington Post found that Trump had sought credit for charity he had not given or had claimed other peoples giving as his own.n" "Now of course because hes refused to release his tax returns we dont even know if hes ever given anything, 1687, 1736
But heres what we do know, 1736, 1742
With Donald its always Donald Trump first and everyone else last, 1742, 1753
He abuses his power, 1753, 1757
He games the system and he doesnt care whos left holding the bag.n" "And heres what else we know, 1757, 1776
Donald Trump has a terrible record on LGBT rights, 1776, 1785
And this election will determine whether we continue the progress weve made or let it be ripped away, 1785, 1803
We know Trump has promised hell appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn marriage equality and that he will repeal President Obamas executive actions to protect LGBT people from discrimination, 1803, 1833
And just this week a new story came out that tells us a lot about how he treats LGBT employees, 1833, 1853
Its a story of a maintenance worker at one of Trumps golf courses, 1853, 1866
So I want you just to think.n" "This guy works hard, 1866, 1877
Works with his hands, 1877, 1881
Probably there 12 hours a day maybe more when its the summer season, 1881, 1894
After he told his coworkers he was gay they started harassing him, 1894, 1906
They called him names, 1906, 1910
They even threw rocks and golf balls at him, 1910, 1919
It got so bad he ended up in the hospital, 1919, 1929
Now his supervisor saw all of this and did nothing, 1929, 1939
So finally he went to the police for help, 1939, 1948
He was too scared even to come back to work, 1948, 1958
And what did the Trump golf course do? They fired him.n" "Now this is a heart-wrenching story on a lot of levels, 1958, 1980
For starters its a painful reminder of the harassment violence and discrimination too many LGBT Americans still face every single day, 1980, 2001
And its deeply distributing that instead of stepping in to stop this unacceptable behavior Trumps business punished the victim for coming forward, 2001, 2023
Now if thats how Donald Trump runs his business what does it say about how he would run our country? Weve made a lot of progress on LGBT rights but as that story reminds us we still have work ahead dont we?n" "There is still no federal law that stops an employer from refusing to hire someone just because he or she is LGBT or a landlord from refusing to rent an apartment to a transgender tenant and of course there are still states where you could get married on Saturday post your Facebook photos on Sunday and get fired on Monday just because of who you are and who you love, 2023, 2135
So heres what Ill do as president, 2135, 2142
We will call on the Congress to pass the Equality Act, 2142, 2153
And we will then be able to protect LGBT Americans from discrimination in all aspects of our lives, 2153, 2171
Well work together to achieve the AIDS-free generation that is within our reach, 2171, 2184
And we will take on homelessness bullying and violence particularly youth homelessness which disproportionately hurts LGBT kids, 2184, 2201
And we are going to end the harmful practice of so-called conversion therapy, 2201, 2214
LGBT kids dont need to be cured of anything, 2214, 2223
They just need to be accepted and embraced and respected, 2223, 2233
And yes were going to bring people together to reform our gun laws and keep guns from falling into the wrong hands so that what happened in Orlando can never happen again.n" "Now some of you know Chad Griffin and others know this issue is really important to me, 2233, 2282
I traveled to 112 countries as your Secretary of State, 2282, 2292
I saw how countries around the world treated lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people, 2292, 2306
And I believe with all my heart America has to lead by example, 2306, 2319
I want – I want LGBT people in every corner of our country – because dont forget you all living in Wilton Manors have moved far away from a lot of the places where people are still scared today, 2319, 2358
Right? And were going to elevate this issue, 2358, 2366
Were going to talk about it, 2366, 2372
Were going to reach out.n" "So when you vote in this election remember its not just my name on the ballot, 2372, 2393
Its your future, 2393, 2396
Its who we are as a country, 2396, 2403
Its every issue we care about, 2403, 2409
And make no mistake: LGBT rights are at stake, 2409, 2418
Dignity and respect for every American is at stake, 2418, 2427
The future of our economy is at stake.n" "I believe when the middle class thrives Americans thrive, 2427, 2444
And were going to make America the clean-energy superpower of the 21st Century too, 2444, 2458
And if were serious about supporting a middle class were going to be supporting families.n" The other day I was in Pittsburgh, 2458, 2480
And there was a woman there with her young child, 2480, 2490
Weve got some folks from Pittsburgh, 2490, 2496
She was shaking Tim Kaines hand, 2496, 2502
And she said to him "I came here hoping I could tell you or Secretary Clinton I had my baby three years ago, 2502, 2525
And the next day I was fired, 2525, 2532
It had been a difficult pregnancy, 2532, 2538
I called to ask if I could take a little time to recover and the answer was No, 2538, 2556
Dont come back at all, 2556, 2561
Nobody no parent should ever have to make that kind of choice but thats also true when we talk about paid family leave caring for a spouse or a partner caring for an elderly relative.n "I want us to recognize the way we live today, 2561, 2606
It is no longer the 1950s, 2606, 2612
We need to support people who are part of committed relationships of families of marriages and give everybody the support you need to actually do whats the most important thing in life, 2612, 2644
And that is caring for each other, 2644, 2651
Were going to do everything we can to catch up to the rest of the world: affordable childcare paid family leave earned sick days jobs with rising incomes, 2651, 2679
Were going to raise the national minimum wage, 2679, 2687
No one who works full-time should have to raise a family in poverty.n" "And yes were going to guarantee equal pay for womens work, 2687, 2711
Were going to make sure, 2711, 2716
Were going to make sure that we not only grow the economy but we make it fairer, 2716, 2733
And Ive got to tell you thats such a stark contrast with Trump, 2733, 2746
He believes if you give the biggest tax cut in American history to the wealthy – thats with trillions of dollars going to the top – that will somehow trickle down, 2746, 2777
It hasnt worked, 2777, 2780
It wont work, 2780, 2783
I believe that we could grow the economy from the middle out and the bottom up, 2783, 2799
And thats exactly what were going to do.n" "So my friends weve got a guy who wont pay his income tax, 2799, 2820
I mean Ive got to just say when we learned in the debate that he lost a billion dollars and that meant that he didnt pay income tax for like 20 years he said that was smart, 2820, 2857
And I thought to myself how smart do you have to be to lose a billion dollars? I mean really, 2857, 2877
And what kind of genius are you to lose a billion dollars while running casinos? But its serious because it means hes paid zero zero for our military our vets for healthcare for Pell Grants for our universities our colleges our highways, 2877, 2919
This is Trump to a T.n" "The stories that I told you about him showing up and acting like hes done something well he shows up and criticizes our country, 2919, 2949
He shows up and discriminates against African Americans when he was denying them the right to rent apartments, 2949, 2967
He chose to make his products in other countries not America, 2967, 2978
Hes built a career on stiffing small businesses, 2978, 2986
I take that personally, 2986, 2990
My dad was a small business owner, 2990, 2997
Im sure glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump.n" "So my friends weve got work to do, 2997, 3016
And lets get to that work, 3016, 3022
Weve got to make sure that we get everybody out to vote, 3022, 3034
I want you to be able to say on November 9th you voted for a better future you voted for a better America, 3034, 3057
And look how easy it is, 3057, 3063
