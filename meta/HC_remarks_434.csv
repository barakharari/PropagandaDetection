 "We are really happy to campaign together, 0, 7
As you know Tim has been doing the most amazing job around the country hitting every state multiple times along with Ann his extraordinary wife who has been campaigning tirelessly on her own as well, 7, 42
"So we dont get a lot of chance to actually gather because we want to cover more ground together, 42, 61
But today was a real opportunity for us." I just want to make two quick points, 61, 77
First as we are traveling in the last 17 days we are going to be emphasizing the importance of electing democrats down ballot, 77, 100
And in particular as I said today we are strongly supportive of Katie Mcginty in her race for the senate, 100, 120
We will be I think meeting up with her in Philadelphia tonight, 120, 132
So we will have a chance to do that with her, 132, 143
I will be doing the same as we go from state to state as will Tim, 143, 159
The other point is today we are making our closing arguments, 159, 170
We are talking about what is at stake in the election we are drawing contrasts but we are giving people something to vote for not just against, 170, 197
"And I saw where our opponent Donald Trump went to Gettysburg one of the most extraordinary places in American history and basically said if hes president he will spend his time suing women who have made charges against him based on his behavior." Tim and I are going to keep talking about what we want to do if we are given the great honor of serving as president and vice president, 197, 268
As we said in the book "Stronger To-gether" we have very specific plans, 268, 281
And we are going to get together after the election and do everything possible to be prepared on January 20th to start doing the business of the American people, 281, 310
 Secretary Clinton Trump today also suggested that democrats or the Clinton campaign were behind these women coming forward and making these accusations, 310, 332
What do you have to say to that?  That is just not accurate, 332, 345
 We have started to hear some republicans say that it if you win it will not be because American voters have endorsed your platform but rather that they have rejected Trumps, 345, 376
How would you respond to that and would that get in the way of an effort to bring the country back together and have a mandate for the presidency?  Well clearly we are going to spend the next 17 days making the case to persuade as many Americans as possible across our country to vote for Tim and me, 376, 435
We have close elections in America, 435, 441
You can go back and check that out for the last 4 6 8 of them, 441, 457
it is not unusual that the election would be close, 457, 467
So we are not taking anything for granted, 467, 475
We are working our hearts out and covering as much ground, 475, 486
We have great events planned, 486, 491
We have great surrogates coming out to support us that are both campaigning with us and campaigning on their own to try to convince as many people as possible to go vote, 491, 523
"As i said in pittsburgh we are seeing some really encouraging signs about the turnout, 523, 538
the 200 million voter registration mark is huge its never been reached before, 538, 551
50 million as the best estimate being young people is so encouraging." "And then what we are seeing from early vote returns I think we are over 4 million already, 551, 581
So I am not going to speculate about the outcome of the election people know what Tim and I want to do, 581, 603
We have been very clear about that, 603, 610
Weve laid it out in every way that we could in every different kind of forum, 610, 626
And I am going to be reaching out to people on the other side of the aisle to everybody that will possibly come together with us."  Do you see any of the outreach you have done to republicans who have rejected Donald Trump as carrying over into your potential administration? And how would fishers in the party impact some of those big items on your agenda particularly immigration?  Amy I am very encouraged by what I think we can get accomplished, 626, 707
I came into the senate in 2000 as you know and I made it clear from the beginning that I wanted work with people, 707, 731
"I didnt have any expectations about being treated any differently than anybody else, 731, 744
And I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every republican I served with." "I think last time we had it counted 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or cosponsor, 744, 789
You dont get that done unless you work with folks on the other side." So I have a record of doing that not just in the senate but as first lady and secretary of state, 789, 824
And people know that, 824, 828
And we will begin to get to work right away and reach out to everybody that we can possibly touch to start talking about what we can do together, 828, 857
And I think there is a big agenda where we can find common ground, 857, 871
 Madam Secretary have you thought at all about who you might put in your cabinet if you win? "Clinton: No I really havent, 871, 894
I am a little superstitious about that, 894, 901
We have got a transition operation going and I havent really paid much attention to it yet because I want to focus on what our first task is and that is convincing as many Americans as possible to give us the chance to serve."  What kind of qualities are you looking forâ€”  I am not going to talk anymore about that, 901, 962
" I was wondering you touched on it earlier at the event but what would your response be to trumps assertion that there is a vast media conspiracy against him supporting your campaign?"  You know I debated him for 4.5 hours, 962, 1003
I am not even going to think about responding to him anymore, 1003, 1015
"I will let the American people think about what he offers and what we offer, 1015, 1030
He can say whatever he wants and he can run his campaign however he wants to, 1030, 1046
He can go off on tangents he can go to Gettysburg and say hes going to sue women who have made accusations against him." I am going to keep talking about what we want to do what we think the country de-serves from the next president and vice president, 1046, 1095
And actually when it comes right down to it that is what I think people end up voting on, 1095, 1114
Thank you all very much, 1114, 1119
" Secretary Clinton are you truly concerned that Donald trump would try to throw you in jail if he were elected? And one other issue there was a Wikileaks email in which one of you top aids said that a Clinton Foundation conference thats now being labeled by some of your critics as a pay to play scheme was a mess of your own making, 1119, 1184
Would you comment on that as well?"  No I have nothing to say about Wikileaks other than I think we should all be concerned about what the Russians are trying to do to our election and using Wikileaks very blatantly to try to influence the outcome of the election, 1184, 1233
I have no concerns about the first question whatsoever." , 1233, 1242
