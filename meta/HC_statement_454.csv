Yesterday thexa0 xa0published new documents that showed Trump engaged in "legally dubious" schemes to avoid paying millions in federal income taxes even as his own lawyers made clear they likely would not hold up to IRS scrutiny, 0, 37
Trumps campaign claims the reporting is not true yet they refuse to produce the only evidence that could prove the Times wrong: Trumps tax returns, 37, 62
In response to the new report Hillary for America deputy communications director Christina Reynolds issued the following statement: Trump and his campaign continue toxa0 "xa0of these critical documents that could shed light on important issues including his wealth his questionable charitable giving his foreign and domestic business entanglements his personal tax rate and more, 62, 116
The Times reporting raising important new questions that underscore the urgency in releasing the tax returns before Election Day." Donald J, 116, 137
Trump proudly acknowledges he did not pay a dime in federal income taxes for years on end, 137, 154
He insists he merely exploited tax loopholes legally available to any billionaire — loopholes he says Hillary Clinton failed to close during her years in the United States Senate, 154, 183
"Why didnt she ever try to change those laws so I couldnt use them?" Mr, 183, 198
Trump asked during a campaign rally last month, 198, 206
But newly obtained documents show that in the early 1990s as he scrambled to stave off financial ruin Mr, 206, 225
Trump avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income by using a tax avoidance maneuver so legally dubious his own lawyers advised him that the Internal Revenue Service would likely declare it improper if he were audited, 225, 264
Thanks to this one maneuver — which was later outlawed by Congress — Mr, 264, 278
Trump potentially escaped paying tens of millions of dollars in federal personal income taxes, 278, 292
It is impossible to know for sure because Mr, 292, 301
Trump has declined to release his tax returns or even a summary of his returns breaking a practice followed by every Republican and Democratic presidential candidate for more than four decades, 301, 332
Tax experts who reviewed the newly obtained documents for The New York Times said Mr, 332, 347
Trumps tax avoidance maneuver conjured from ambiguous provisions of highly technical tax court rulings clearly pushed the edge of the envelope of what tax laws permitted at the time, 347, 376
"Whatever loophole existed was not exploited here but stretched beyond any recognition" said Steven M, 376, 391
Rosenthal a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center who helped draft tax legislation in the early 1990s, 391, 410
"Moreover the tax experts said the maneuver trampled a core tenet of American tax policy by conferring enormous tax benefits to Mr, 410, 432
Trump for losing vast amounts of other peoples money — in this case money investors and banks had entrusted to him to build a casino empire in Atlantic City." "As that empire floundered in the early 1990s Mr, 432, 470
Trump pressured his financial backers to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt he could not repay, 470, 488
While the cancellation of so much debt gave new life to Mr, 488, 500
Trumps casinos it created a potentially crippling problem with the Internal Revenue Service, 500, 513
In the eyes of the I.R.S, 513, 519
a dollar of canceled debt is the same as a dollar of taxable income, 519, 533
This meant Mr, 533, 536
Trump faced the painful prospect of having to report the hundreds of millions of dollars of canceled debt as if it were hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income." But Mr, 536, 568
Trumps audacious tax-avoidance maneuver gave him a way to simply avoid reporting any of that canceled debt to the I.R.S, 568, 588
"Hes getting something for absolutely nothing" John L, 588, 596
Buckley who served as the chief of staff for Congresss Joint Committee on Taxation in 1993 and 1994 said in an interview "The new documents which include correspondence from Mr, 596, 626
Trumps tax lawyers and bond offering disclosure statements might also help explain how Mr, 626, 640
Trump reported a staggering loss of $916 million in his 1995 tax returns — portions of which were first published by The Times last month." "United States tax laws allowed Mr, 640, 671
Trump to use that $916 million loss to cancel out an equivalent amount of taxable income, 671, 687
But tax experts have been debating how Mr, 687, 695
Trump could have legally declared a deduction of that magnitude at all, 695, 707
Among other things they have noted that Mr, 707, 715
Trumps huge casino losses should have been offset by the hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income he surely must have reported to the I.R.S, 715, 741
in the form of canceled casino debt." "By avoiding reporting his canceled casino debt in the first place however Mr, 741, 761
Trumps $916 million deduction would not have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars, 761, 776
He could have preserved the deduction and used it instead to avoid paying income taxes he might otherwise have owed on books TV shows or branding deals, 776, 803
Under the rules in effect in 1995 the $916 million loss could have been used to wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income for 18 years." Mr, 803, 834
Trump declined to comment for this article, 834, 841
"Your e-mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law" Hope Hicks Mr, 841, 858
Trumps spokeswoman said in a statement, 858, 864
"Your thesis is a criticism not just of Mr, 864, 873
Trump but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe, 873, 905
Mr, 905, 906
Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the I.R.S, 906, 924
And any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation, 924, 937
There is no news here." Mr, 937, 943
Trump financed his three Atlantic City gambling resorts with $1.3 billion in debt most of it in the form of high interest junk bonds, 943, 967
By late 1990 after months of escalating operating losses New Jersey casino regulators were warning that "a complete financial collapse of the Trump Organization was not out of the question." By 1992 all three casinos had filed for bankruptcy and bondholders were ultimately forced to forgive hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to salvage at least part of their investment, 967, 1028
"The story of how Mr, 1028, 1033
Trump sidestepped a potentially ruinous tax bill from that forgiven debt emerged from documents recently discovered by The Times during a search of the casino bankruptcy filings, 1033, 1060
The documents offer only a partial description of events and none of Mr, 1060, 1073
Trumps tax lawyers agreed to be interviewed for this article." At the time Mr, 1073, 1087
Trump would have been hard-pressed to pay tens of millions of dollars in taxes, 1087, 1101
According to assessments of his financial stability by New Jersey casino regulators there were times in the early 1990s when Mr, 1101, 1122
Trump had no more than a few million dollars in his various bank accounts, 1122, 1136
He was so strapped for cash that his creditors were apoplectic when they learned that Mr, 1136, 1152
Trump had bought Marla Maples an engagement ring estimated to be worth $250000, 1152, 1165
It is unclear who first glimpsed a way for Mr, 1165, 1175
Trump to dodge a huge tax bill, 1175, 1182
But the basic maneuver he used was essentially a new twist on a contentious strategy corporations had been using for years to avoid taxes created by canceled debt, 1182, 1210
The strategy — known among tax practitioners as a "stock-for-debt swap" — relies on mathematical sleight of hand, 1210, 1228
Say a company can repay only $60 million of a $100 million bank loan, 1228, 1242
If the bank forgives the remaining $40 million the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled $40 million debt as taxable income, 1242, 1271
Clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience, 1271, 1280
The company would simply swap stock for the $40 million in debt it could not repay, 1280, 1296
This way it would look as if the entire $100 million loan had been repaid and presto: There would be no tax bill due for $40 million in canceled debt, 1296, 1326
Best of all it did not matter if the actual market value of the stock was considerably less than the $40 million in canceled debt, 1326, 1351
(Stock in an effectively insolvent company could easily be next to worthless.) Even in the opaque rarefied world of gaming impenetrable tax regulations this particular maneuver was about as close as a company could get to waving a magic wand and making taxes disappear, 1351, 1395
Alarmed by the obvious potential for abuse Congress and the I.R.S, 1395, 1406
made repeated efforts during the 1980s to curb this brand of tax wizardry before banning its use by corporations altogether in 1993, 1406, 1428
But while policy makers were busy trying to stop corporations from using this particular ploy the endlessly creative club of elite tax advisers was inventing a new way to circumvent the ban this time through the use of partnerships, 1428, 1467
This was the twist that was especially beneficial to Mr, 1467, 1477
Trump, 1477, 1478
Wealthy families like the Trumps often own real estate and other assets through partnerships rather than corporations, 1478, 1495
Mr, 1495, 1496
Trump for example owned all three of his Atlantic City casinos through partnerships an arrangement that allowed casino profits to flow directly to his personal tax returns when times were good, 1496, 1527
"But what if times were bad? What if Mr, 1527, 1536
Trumps casino partnerships could not repay hundreds of millions of dollars they owed to bondholders? And what if the bondholders were persuaded to forgive this debt? Wouldnt that force the partnerships — i.e, 1536, 1569
Mr, 1569, 1570
Trump — to report hundreds of millions of dollars of taxable income in the form of canceled debt?" Enter the tax advisers with their audacious plan: Why not eliminate all that taxable income from canceled debt by swapping "partnership equity" for debt in exactly the same way corporations had been swapping company stock for debt, 1570, 1625
True enough the I.R.S, 1625, 1629
and Congress had clearly signaled their disapproval of the basic concept, 1629, 1640
Fred T, 1640, 1642
Goldberg who was the I.R.S, 1642, 1647
commissioner under George Bush recalled in an interview that the I.R.S, 1647, 1658
frowned on partnership equity-for-debt swaps for the same reason it objected to corporate stock-for-debt swaps, 1658, 1673
"The fiction is that the partnership interest has the same value as the debt" he said, 1673, 1689
Lee A, 1689, 1691
Sheppard a contributing editor to Tax Notes wrote in 1991 that trying to find a legal justification for this tactic was akin to proving "the existence of the Loch Ness monster." On the campaign trail Mr, 1691, 1727
Trump boasts of his mastery of tax loopholes and claims no other candidate for the White House has ever known more about the tax code, 1727, 1752
This background he argues with evident disgust gives him special insight into the way wealthy elites buy off politicians and hire high-priced lawyers and accountants to rig the tax system — just as he claims they rig elections, 1752, 1790
That insight was on display in 1991 and 1992 when he was laying the groundwork to make a multimillion-dollar tax bill disappear, 1790, 1812
Before proceeding with his plan Mr, 1812, 1818
Trump did what most prudent taxpayers do — he sought a formal tax opinion letter, 1818, 1833
Such letters typically written by highly-paid lawyers who spend entire careers mastering the roughly 10000 pages of ever-changing statutes that make up the United States tax code can provide important protection to taxpayers, 1833, 1866
As long as a tax adviser blesses a particular tax strategy in a formal opinion letter the taxpayer most likely will not face penalties even if the I.R.S, 1866, 1894
ultimately rules the strategy was improper, 1894, 1900
The language used in tax opinion letters has a specialized meaning understood by all tax professionals, 1900, 1916
So for example when a tax lawyer writes that a shelter is "more likely than not" going to be approved by the I.R.S, 1916, 1939
this means there is at least a 51 percent chance the shelter will withstand scrutiny, 1939, 1954
(This is known as an "M.L.T.N." letter in the vernacular of tax lawyers.) A "should" letter means there is about a 75 percent chance the I.R.S, 1954, 1980
will not object, 1980, 1983
The gold standard a "will" letter means the I.R.S, 1983, 1992
is all but certain to bless the tax avoidance strategy, 1992, 2002
But the opinion letters Mr, 2002, 2007
Trump received from his tax lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher were far from the gold standard, 2007, 2024
The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr, 2024, 2041
Trumps tax gambit, 2041, 2044
"Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority" his lawyers wrote "substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan." One letter 25 pages long analyzed seven distinct components of Mr, 2044, 2082
Trumps proposed tax maneuver, 2082, 2086
It found only "substantial authority" for six of the components, 2086, 2096
In the stilted language of tax opinion letters the phrase "substantial authority" is a red flag that the lawyers believe the I.R.S, 2096, 2118
can be expected to rule against the taxpayer roughly two-thirds of the time, 2118, 2131
In other words Mr, 2131, 2135
Trumps tax lawyers were telling him there were at least six different reasons the I.R.S, 2135, 2150
would likely cry foul if he were audited, 2150, 2158
In anticipation of that possibility the lawyers even laid out a fallback plan that would have allowed Mr, 2158, 2176
Trump to spread the pain of a large tax hit over many years if the I.R.S, 2176, 2192
ultimately balked, 2192, 2194
"It is unclear whether the I.R.S, 2194, 2200
ever challenged Mr, 2200, 2203
Trumps use of this specific tax maneuver, 2203, 2210
According to a financial disclosure statement prepared by Mr, 2210, 2219
Trumps accountants he was under audit by tax authorities as of 1993 only a year after he avoided reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income because of this legally suspect tactic, 2219, 2252
But the results of that audit are unknown and the agency declined to comment on Monday." "Regardless of whether the I.R.S, 2252, 2273
objected Mr, 2273, 2275
Trumps tax avoidance in this case violated a central principle of American tax law said Mr, 2275, 2291
Buckley the former chief of staff for Congresss Joint Committee on Taxation who later served as chief tax counsel for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee." "He deducted somebody elses losses" Mr, 2291, 2325
Buckley said, 2325, 2327
By that Mr, 2327, 2330
Buckley means that only the bondholders who forgave Mr, 2330, 2339
Trumps unpaid casino debts should have been allowed to use those losses to offset future income and reduce their taxes, 2339, 2359
That Mr, 2359, 2361
Trump used the same losses to reduce his taxes ultimately increases the tax burden on everyone else Mr, 2361, 2379
Buckley explained, 2379, 2381
"He is double dipping big time." In any event Mr, 2381, 2391
Trump can no longer benefit from the same maneuver, 2391, 2400
Just as Congress acted in 1993 to ban stock-for-debt swaps by corporations it acted in 2004 to ban equity-for-debt swaps by partnerships, 2400, 2422
Among the members of Congress who voted to finally close the loophole: Senator Hillary Clinton of New York, 2422, 2440
