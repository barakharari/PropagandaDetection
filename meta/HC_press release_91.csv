It really is that easy, 0, 5
"Ive worked on a lot of campaigns, 5, 12
And I can tell you from experience—from exhilarating wins to heartbreaking losses—that there is one thing that gets people to the polls and decides the outcome of elections on the ground:" "Most of you probably dont live in Iowa—I dont either, 12, 53
But I bet you know someone who does, 53, 61
And if you want to make sure Hillary Clinton wins the Iowa caucus on February 1 and heads to New Hampshire with as much momentum as possible please believe that the most important thing you can do right now to help Hillary on Monday night is post a message on Facebook and tag your friends in Iowa, 61, 118
(" "—and even if you truly truly dont know anyone in Iowa write a post anyway!)" "It really is that easy, 118, 139
And Im going to make this even easier for you." "Heres what Im posting on Facebook—and what a co-worker of mine is posting as well, 139, 164
Write your own or use ours as inspiration!" "Dont forget to tag your friends in Iowa!" "This is it: Its game time, 164, 186
Lets support our candidate and inspire others to do the same, 186, 197
These next few days could easily define this campaign—so lets leave it all on the field and go win this thing." , 197, 218
