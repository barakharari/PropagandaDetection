Thank you, 0, 2
I am honored to be here today, 2, 9
Let me extend my special gratitude to General Ashenhurst and General Hargett and to each and every one of you, 9, 29
The National Guard of the United States has defended this nation at war kept our citizens safe at home and rushed into danger wherever it has threatened our people, 29, 58
Our debt to you is eternal, 58, 64
Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, 64, 73
The National Guard was sent to assist in the aid and recovery efforts at Ground Zero in New York City, 73, 93
Since 9/11 there have been 780000 members of the National Guard deployed overseas – including those with multiple deployments, 93, 112
Right now 10000 members of the National Guard are in Iraq Afghanistan and many other countries across the world, 112, 131
Members of the National Guard come from all walks of life work in every kind of job imaginable and juggle a thousand different challenges as they raise their kids serve their states and answer the call of duty for their country, 131, 172
If I am given the honor to serve as your President I will pledge to give you the resources the equipment and the support you need and deserve, 172, 200
You will have a true and loyal friend in the White House, 200, 212
Whether you vote for me or whether you vote for someone else I will be your greatest champion, 212, 230
I will not let you down, 230, 236
"I am running to be a President for all Americans – and Ive been especially humbled to have the support of so many of our men and women in uniform." "All across this country Ive met so many incredible members of both our military and law enforcement community, 236, 284
Theres nothing Ive enjoyed more than the time Ive spent with our service members police officers and also our firefighters and paramedics." They embody the goodness and decency of our country, 284, 315
I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack slander smear and demean these wonderful amazing people who are supporting our campaign, 315, 342
Our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life, 342, 355
We have the support of cops and soldiers carpenters and welders the young and the old and millions of working class families who just want a better future, 355, 383
These were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized, 383, 392
These were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable irredeemable and un-American, 392, 406
She called these patriotic men and women every vile name in the book – she called them racist sexist xenophobic and Islamaphobic, 406, 428
She called them a "basket of deplorables" in both a speech and an interview, 428, 442
She divides people into baskets as though they were objects not human beings, 442, 455
Hillary Clinton made these comments at one of her high-dollar fundraisers in Wall Street, 455, 469
She and her wealthy donors all had a good laugh, 469, 479
They were laughing at the very people who pave the roads she drives on paint the buildings she speaks in and keep the lights on in her auditorium, 479, 507
Hillary Clinton is an insider supported by powerful insiders attacking Americans who have no political power, 507, 523
Hillary Clinton spoke with hatred and derision for the people who make this country run, 523, 538
She spoke with contempt for the people who thanklessly follow the rules pay their taxes and scratch out a living for their families, 538, 561
While Hillary Clinton lives a sequestered life behind gates and walls and guards she mocks and demeans hardworking Americans who only want their own families to enjoy a fraction of the security enjoyed by our politicians, 561, 597
After months of hiding from the press Hillary Clinton has revealed her true thoughts, 597, 611
She revealed herself to be a person who looks down on the proud citizens of our country as subjects for her to rule over, 611, 635
Her comments displayed the same sense of arrogance and entitlement that led her to violate federal law as Secretary of State hide and delete her emails put classified information in the reach of our enemies lie to Congress and sell government favors and access through her Foundation, 635, 682
"Its the same attitude that explains why Hillary Clinton refuses to take accountability for the deadly disasters she helped to create in Iraq in Syria and in Libya." "To this day she still wont take accountability for her role in unleashing ISIS across the Middle East – or for putting Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon." Hillary Clinton believes she is above the law that she is above accountability and that she is above each and every one of you, 682, 764
"Our campaign is about giving voice to the voiceless, 764, 773
Its about representing the forgotten men and women of this country." "Im here to represent everyone but especially those who are struggling against injustice and unfairness." "I am running so that the powerful can no longer beat up on the powerless, 773, 814
Im running to take on the special interests the big donors and the corrupt political insiders." I am running to be your voice, 814, 837
"Hillary Clinton is a voice for Wall Street for hedge fund managers for the top tenth of the one percent, 837, 857
Just look at the people funding Hillary Clintons campaign and paying for her speeches and youll know who she represents." The disdain that Hillary Clinton expressed towards millions of decent Americans disqualifies her from public service, 857, 893
"You cannot run for President if you have such contempt in your heart for the American voter, 893, 910
You cant lead this nation if you have such a low opinion of its citizens." "Hillary Clinton still hasnt apologized to those she slandered, 910, 934
In fact she hasnt backed down at all – shes doubled-down on her campaign of conspiracy and contempt." "If Hillary Clinton will not retract her comments in full then I dont see how she can credibly campaign." "Lets be clear, 934, 974
These were not offhand comments from Hillary Clinton, 974, 982
These were not stray remarks in an interview or an accidental choice of words, 982, 996
These were lengthy planned and prepared remarks – it was perhaps the most explicit attack on the American voter ever spoken by a major-party presidential nominee." Clinton was using a very deliberate page from the Democratic Playbook – smearing someone with one of those names in order to scare them out of voting for change, 996, 1051
She just took it to a whole new level by applying it to tens of millions of people, 1051, 1069
She used these vile words in order to bully and intimidate honest citizens out of seeking government reform, 1069, 1087
People who want their immigration laws enforced and their borders secured are not racists, 1087, 1101
They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs and families protected, 1101, 1115
People who warn about Radical Islamic Terrorism are not Islamophobes, 1115, 1125
They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our tolerant values and keep our country safe, 1125, 1142
People who support the police and who want crime reduced are not prejudiced, 1142, 1155
They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence, 1155, 1174
"Hillary Clinton doesnt have to worry about Sanctuary Cities or jobs moving overseas, 1174, 1187
Shes protected from her own policies." The policies of Hillary Clinton have produced failing schools shrinking incomes and the tragic poverty and joblessness in our inner cities, 1187, 1214
Our campaign is dedicated to changing these policies to make life better for all Americans, 1214, 1229
We are the campaign of school choice, 1229, 1236
We are the campaign dedicated to improving economic conditions for every African-American and Hispanic worker, 1236, 1251
We are the campaign that will deliver a government of by and for the people, 1251, 1266
This change agenda includes a new foreign and military policy, 1266, 1276
We are going to put the failed policies of the past behind us, 1276, 1289
We will empower our generals to do the job they were hired to do – and that begins with defeating and destroying ISIS, 1289, 1312
Instead of endless wars we want a real plan for victory, 1312, 1323
We will abandon the policy of reckless regime change favored by my opponent and we will instead work with our allies to advance the core national security interests of the United States, 1323, 1355
My plan calls for a major rebuilding of the entire military and the elimination of the defense sequester, 1355, 1373
In this rebuilding we will provide our National Guard with the best modern state-of-the-art equipment in the world, 1373, 1391
The National Guard is often the first and the last line of defense for our people, 1391, 1407
You are there when the hurricanes and floods and tornadoes strike, 1407, 1418
You are there to protect civilians in times of unrest, 1418, 1428
You are there to respond to every natural disaster, 1428, 1437
You deserve a government that recognizes and honors your contribution and that ensures you have the resources you need to get the job done, 1437, 1461
In a Trump Administration the National Guard will always have a direct line to the Oval Office, 1461, 1478
You will have an Administration that never loses sight of the vital contribution you make each and every day, 1478, 1497
You will have a President who supports promotes and speaks up for the National Guard at every turn, 1497, 1515
The members of the National Guard have sacrificed life and limb for our freedom our safety and our country, 1515, 1534
"We will never forget our heroes their families and the ones theyve left behind." Our gratitude is everlasting, 1534, 1552
We will protect those who protect us, 1552, 1559
And we will follow your example of unity – working in common purpose and common cause, 1559, 1575
We will be one people under one God saluting one American flag, 1575, 1587
We will rebuild our military – and our country, 1587, 1596
We Will Make America Strong Again, 1596, 1602
We Will Make America Safe Again, 1602, 1608
And We Will Make America Great Again, 1608, 1615
Thank you and God Bless you all, 1615, 1622
