Thank you, 0, 2
I am so thrilled to be here in Reno With your help in 34 days we are going to win this state we are going to win the White House and we are going to bring back our jobs, 2, 41
We are going to make America rich again, 41, 49
I am going to end illegal immigration stop the massive inflow of refugees keep jobs from pouring out of our country renegotiate our disastrous trade deals and massively reduce taxes and regulations on our workers and our small businesses, 49, 88
"Hillary Clinton has been there for 30 years and hasnt fixed anything, 88, 100
In fact shes just made things worse – its been 30 years of failure." The problems we face as a country are immense and it is going to take bold action to turn things around, 100, 135
Right now we owe $20 trillion in debt, 135, 143
It doubled under President Obama, 143, 148
Our infrastructure is like that of a third-world country, 148, 157
The homicide rate last year experienced the biggest single-year increase in 45 years, 157, 170
Heroin overdoses are surging and meth overdoses in Nevada are up 22 percent, 170, 183
Thousands of refugees are being admitted with no way to screen them and are instantly made eligible for welfare and free healthcare – even as our own Veterans die waiting for the medical care they need, 183, 219
Our annual trade deficit with the world is nearly $800 billion a year, 219, 232
The federal budget is a disaster, 232, 238
Our State Department mostly under the watch of Hillary Clinton misplaced or lost $6 billion in taxpayer funds, 238, 256
We have the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression, 256, 266
"On top of it all our taxpaying citizens send troops and foreign aid all over the world even as their own cities cant provide the most basic services." America needs a turnaround, 266, 298
America needs a comeback, 298, 302
America needs a change, 302, 306
And that change is coming on November 8th, 306, 314
We are going to show the whole world that America is back – bigger and better and stronger than ever before, 314, 335
First we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, 335, 344
President Bill Clinton has come out and told the truth about Obamacare, 344, 356
Two days ago Bill Clinton torched President Obamas signature legislation, 356, 366
Remember Hillary Clinton called Obamacare "one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama of the Democratic Party and of our country." Bill has a different view, 366, 392
Here is what bill said: He just said its a "crazy system" and that "its the craziest thing in the world." Bill said: "people out there are busting it sometimes 60 hours a week and wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half…the people getting killed in this deal are the small business people and the individuals who make just a bit too much money to get any of these subsidies." Clinton added that it "doesnt make any sense" and that "the insurance model doesnt work." There is only one way to stop Obamacare: to vote for Trump, 392, 494
The deadline to register to vote by mail is October 8th, 494, 505
The deadline to register to vote online or in-person is October 18th, 505, 517
And early voting begins on the 22nd, 517, 524
With your votes you will also be voting to protect the 2ndamendment rights of every law-abiding gun-owner in Nevada, 524, 543
Hillary wants to effectively abolish the 2ndamendment by overturning D.C, 543, 553
vs, 553, 554
Heller and declaring that guns are not a private right, 554, 564
We are also going to conserve your land and natural resources for hunters anglers and all who enjoy the outdoors, 564, 584
Fixing our trade deals will be the foundation of our economic revival My economic agenda can be summed up with three very simple words: jobs jobs jobs, 584, 611
But to bring back our jobs we must fix our trade deals – and stand up to countries that cheat, 611, 631
China Japan and Europe are printing huge sums of money – the devaluation of currencies is staggering as to what it represents for our country our businesses and our citizens, 631, 661
"Were not on a level playing field and our politicians dont understand what is going on." Our jobs are being lost in massive numbers and we are not making things in America anymore, 661, 694
Too much is being made in other countries, 694, 702
When I am President we will start making things in America again, 702, 714
"Our nation has lost one-third of its manufacturing jobs since Bill Clintons NAFTA – a deal supported by Hillary Clinton, 714, 734
Hillarys Korea deal also cost us another 100000 jobs." Since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal – 70000 factories have shut down or left the United States, 734, 767
"Thats 15 factories closing a day on average." "The jobs are leaving Nevada North Carolina Pennsylvania Ohio New Hampshire Michigan Illinois Virginia and all across this country, 767, 794
Im going to stop the jobs from leaving our country – and Im going to bring millions of new jobs back into our country." "Its going to be a new day in America." "For too long weve rebuilt other countries at the expense of our own." Skyscrapers go up in Beijing while plants and factories crumble in the United States, 794, 854
Companies like Carrier General Electric Motorola Mattel Fiat Chrysler and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico and to other countries, 854, 877
"And now Ford has announced its moving all of its small car production to Mexico also." "We are going to renegotiate NAFTA and if we dont get the deal we want we will withdraw from NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal for our workers." We will also lower taxes on American business from 35% to 15% and we will have the largest regulatory reform in American history, 877, 948
Thousands of new companies millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars in new wealth will come pouring into the United States, 948, 970
But to be a rich nation we must also be a secure nation, 970, 983
Security begins at the border, 983, 988
Hillary Clinton is unfit to be President because she supports open borders, 988, 1000
"In fact as Secretary of State she allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be freed into our country because their own countries wouldnt take them back -- it was her job to cancel visas to countries that refused to take back their criminals." "But she didnt do it." "The ICE officers who endorsed me – their first endorsement of a candidate ever – issued a lengthy statement on Hillary Clintons immigration plans." Let me read from it, 1000, 1077
Again this all a quote from the ICE officers: "Hillary Clinton has promised the most radical immigration proposal in U.S, 1077, 1097
history." "Her radical plan would result in the loss of thousands of innocent American lives mass victimization and death for many attempting to immigrate to the United States the total gutting of interior enforcement the handcuffing of ICE officers and an uncontrollable flood of illegal immigrants across U.S, 1097, 1145
borders." Their quote continues, 1145, 1149
"She proposes to keep and expand executive amnesty to expand catch- and-release to expand President Obamas non-enforcement priorities to the point where there is virtually no real immigration enforcement or policing of visa overstays to support Sanctuary Cities to extend Obamacare to illegal immigrants to grant amnesty within 100 days to extend Social Security and Medicare to illegal immigrants through amnesty plus a 550% increase in the admission of Syrian refugees." The ICE officers conclude by saying: "Her plan is total amnesty plus open borders." "That whole quote is from the nations Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officers, 1149, 1246
In short Hillarys immigration stance is disqualifying." The first duty of the President of the United States is to protect the citizens of the United States – anyone who fails to understand that is unworthy to lead this nation, 1246, 1285
There are more than 2 million criminal aliens with convictions in the country right now and many more criminal illegal immigrants who have committed severe offenses but escaped the law entirely – when I am President we are getting them out and we are getting them out quickly, 1285, 1333
At the same time our country is being infiltrated by terrorists, 1333, 1344
Hundreds of immigrants from high-risk regions have been implicated in terrorism inside the United States since 9/11, 1344, 1361
The terrorists who planted the bombs in New York and New Jersey and who carried out the mall stabbing in Minnesota were foreign nationals admitted into our country – as was the mall shooter in Washington State, 1361, 1398
The Boston Bombers were here on asylum, 1398, 1405
The San Bernardino Shooter was here on a fiancé visa from Saudi Arabia, 1405, 1418
The Orlando shooter was the son of a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, 1418, 1430
Yet Hillary Clinton wants a 550% increase in Syrian Refugees, 1430, 1440
I am not running to be President of the world, 1440, 1450
I am running to be President of the United States, 1450, 1460
I am for America First, 1460, 1465
We are going to build a border wall enforce our laws and keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country, 1465, 1485
We are also going to end the government corruption Hillary Clinton put her emails on an illegal secret server open to foreign hacking, 1485, 1508
Then she bleached and destroyed 33000 emails – after a congressional subpoena, 1508, 1520
She lied to Congress under oath and her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals, 1520, 1537
"Its worse than Watergate." "Hillary Clinton put her public office up for sale and if she ever got the chance shed put the Oval Office up for sale too." "Now we have learned that the FBI made a side deal with Clintons top aides to DESTROY their laptops." Hillary Clinton is the ringleader of a criminal enterprise and the only way to deliver justice is to show up and vote, 1537, 1607
We are also going to fix our inner cities and help Latino Americans 45% of African-American children under the age of 6 live in poverty, 1607, 1632
"58% of African-American youth dont have jobs." More than 3000 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, 1632, 1654
"The Democrats like Hillary Clinton have run the inner cities for 50 years sixty years seventy years or more, 1654, 1673
Theyve produced only more joblessness failing schools and rising crime." To those African-Americans suffering in our country I say: What do you have to lose? Vote For Donald Trump, 1673, 1702
I will fix it, 1702, 1706
I will be your greatest champion and I will deliver real change and justice in your communities, 1706, 1723
I am also going to fight to help millions of Latinos trapped in poverty and fight to provide school choice to every low-income African-American and Latino child in this nation, 1723, 1753
Here are some more amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017: We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; lift restrictions on all sources of American energy and put the miners and steelworkers back to work; end Common Core; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, 1753, 1850
This Election Day you have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this country, 1850, 1871
On November 8th the arrogance of Washington D.C, 1871, 1879
will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter, 1879, 1892
The failed and corrupt political establishment will be replaced with a new government of by and for the people, 1892, 1911
I am going to fight for every citizen of every background from every stretch of this nation – and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans, 1911, 1942
Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People under One God saluting One American Flag, 1942, 1963
"Youre going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life, 1963, 1977
Youre going to remember this day, 1977, 1983
This is a movement like youve never seen before, 1983, 1992
Were going to make history together." "Youre going to look back at this election and say this is by far the most important vote Ive ever cast for anyone at any time." A vote for me is a vote for change and a vote for me is really a vote for you, 1992, 2044
You are voting to believe in yourselves, 2044, 2051
You are voting to believe in your future, 2051, 2059
You are voting to believe in your country, 2059, 2067
All together we are going to – Make America wealthy again, 2067, 2078
We are going to make America strong again, 2078, 2086
We are going to make America safe again, 2086, 2094
And we are going to make America great again, 2094, 2103
