 We begin with campaign 2016 and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton who is fighting to close a double-digit gap in the polls behind Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, 0, 30
She joins us from Manchester, 30, 35
Secretary Clinton your name came up not surprisingly in the Republican debate, 35, 47
  "Senator Marco Rubio claimed that on the question of abortion that you support abortion on babys due date, 47, 65
What do you say to that?" " Well I think its pretty pathetic John, 65, 79
This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio has been just going as far as he can to try to I guess buttress his credentials with certain parts of the Republican constituency, 79, 111
I have been on record for years about where I stand on making abortion safe and legal the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into and the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions, 111, 157
And to begin to politicize this so early in the campaign season to try to raise the false charges and look like hes going to try to make sure Roe v, 157, 188
Wade is overturned and Planned Parenthood is defunded is just a tried-and-true tactic by those on the right." " His charge here though is in terms of late-term abortions that you talk about medical issues but there are nonmedical abortions he would say and others who share his view would say and that youre not having any restrictions on those who would choose to have an abortion for nonmedical reasons puts you on the extreme side of this." " Well its just not true, 188, 272
People should go back read Roe v, 272, 279
Wade, 279, 280
Reasonable kinds of restrictions can be imposed as long as the life and health of the mother are taken into account and that is what the law is today, 280, 309
And I remember very well having a lot of incredibly difficult conversations listening to women who were told something devastating toward the end of their pregnancy who were facing horrible kinds of consequences to their health and even potentially to their life, 309, 351
Thats why this has to be taken into account by each individual woman by her physician and her family, 351, 370
But of course under Roe v, 370, 376
Wade there are certain guidelines, 376, 381
And Senator Rubio should know that or I hope he does now."  In the town hall the other night you said that the financial interests — quote — "are not giving me very much money now." But according to "The Washington Post" analysis donors of hedge funds banks insurance companies and other financial service firms have given you at least $21.4 million, 381, 443
Thats about 10 percent of what you have raised, 443, 452
That seems like a lot of money, 452, 459
" Well thats just not the calculation that we have done, 459, 470
But thats somebodys analysis, 470, 474
Im not going to argue with it, 474, 481
Whats really going on here John is disturbing to me, 481, 491
I will be really frank with you, 491, 498
What the Sanders campaign is trying to do is link donations to my political campaign or really donations to anyones political campaign with undue influence with changing peoples views and votes, 498, 529
I have never ever done that, 529, 535
And I really do resent the implication or as I said the other night the insinuation, 535, 551
It would be like saying that President Obama who took probably more money from Wall Street than any Democrat certainly had in 2008 with his successful campaign was therefore automatically disqualified, 551, 582
Well in fact we know that was not true, 582, 591
He signed the toughest financial regulations since the 1930s with the Dodd-Frank bill, 591, 604
This is a very artful smear, 604, 610
And Im just not going to sit and take it anymore."  Are you saying though on these questions that people from the financial services industry have no greater access to you than anybody else? " Im saying that I am available to and open to listening to people from all walks of life, 610, 663
I always have been, 663, 667
I always will be, 667, 671
But talk to the — if people want to donate to me from whatever industry they know where I stand, 671, 691
They know that I called them out on the mortgage market mess back in — before the great crash happened, 691, 711
And I always like to remind people it was not me it was Senator Sanders who voted to deregulate slots and derivatives which gave Lehman Brothers a lot of extra leverage which was one of the contributing factors to their collapse which obviously contributed to what happened in the great recession, 711, 762
So we can take these step by step and try to unwind them but it doesnt change the basic facts, 762, 782
People know where I stand, 782, 787
I rolled out the toughest most effective effort to rein in financial abuse of anybody in this campaign, 787, 805
And it goes much further than Dodd-Frank, 805, 812
It goes much further than restoring Glass-Steagall a 1930s efforts, 812, 822
It goes into shadow banking, 822, 827
It goes after hedge funds, 827, 832
It goes after carried interest loophole, 832, 838
Now that is full disclosure, 838, 843
I am on the record, 843, 848
If somebody in one of these firms wants to give me money I hope they know theyre giving money to someone who is going to make sure they never wreck the economy again."  In the debate you also said — quote — "Senator Sanders is the only person who I think would characterize me a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment."  Right, 848, 916
" But isnt the experience youre — the experience youre running on gained through years of working in Democratic politics doesnt that put you in the establishment all that experience?" " Well I dont know, 916, 951
Senator Sanders has lot more time in elective office than I do, 951, 963
And I find that sort of an amusing contrast, 963, 972
Hes been elected official for 25 years far longer than I was, 972, 984
I think I bring a great mix of experience, 984, 993
And I think being a woman is a big part of how I see problems how I think about solving problems what I believe is absolutely foundational starting with children and their lives and their opportunities, 993, 1029
On my way to Flint today to go and meet with the mayor who asked me to come because she wants to keep the national spotlight on what happened to the children in her community, 1029, 1064
And I commend her for it, 1064, 1070
So I think that the experiences I have had starting when I was in an advocate taking on the establishment going on to be first lady taking on the drug companies and the pharmacy companies taking on the financial system taking on a lot of big lobbies like the gun lobby I think that I have shown that I have got a lot of experience taking on the establishment, 1070, 1139
And Im proud of what I bring to the table to actually be able to solve problems and get results for people."  All right Secretary Clinton we will have to leave it there, 1139, 1172
Thanks so much for joining us this morning, 1172, 1180
 Great to talk to you John, 1180, 1186
Thanks, 1186, 1187
