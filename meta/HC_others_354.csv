"Donald Trumps latest gimmick to act as if he cares about the black community is downright shameful insulting and cowardly, 0, 20
After 14 months of neglecting us Donald Trump is once again dodging substantive conversations and ducking questions about the issues that impact our community, 20, 44
Not surprisingly Trumps ignorance on issues like the economy criminal justice reform the meaning of quality health care or systemic racism has forced him to resort to scripted conversations and staged engagements with our communities, 44, 79
The problem is our community can see through this: outreach to African Americans cannot be scripted; leaders ought to be prepared to address the hard truths about race and justice in our country, 79, 112
And Trumps discomfort on addressing these issues only reinforces that hes unfit to be our president."xa0 , 112, 128
