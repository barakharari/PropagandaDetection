To Mark and me our principles are what have always mattered most.? As a Navy fighter pilot NASA astronaut and registered Independent Mark never spent much time caring about the "whos up whos down" of partisan politics.? A registered Republican when I was younger I was always committed to Southern Arizona values: independence freedom and common sense.When the Republican Party began to veer away from its core values I ran for office as a proud Democrat.? "When I served my community in the Arizona legislature and later in Congress I joined other like-minded Democrats and Republicans to work for energy independence military readiness a better life for our military families and returning soldiers a womans right to have freedom over her own health choices and a more secure border." For far too long the gun lobby has had a stranglehold on Washington, 0, 142
Members of Congress and even some of our presidents have been intimidated into inaction, 142, 156
Bipartisan action has been blocked, 156, 161
Loopholes in our laws that let dangerous people get guns have been fiercely protected, 161, 175
Lies have been spread fears have been stoked and a dangerous unacceptable status quo has been furthered all while gun sales have skyrocketed.? Throughout all of this the corporate gun lobby has moved further and further away from the gun owners they claim to represent.? "Most of the people running for president talk a lot about how tough they are, 175, 235
But most of them have shown they arent tough enough to stand up to the gun lobbyists." "In fact a lot of the people running for president seem downright terrified to even have a rational conversation about the problem of gun violence in America, 235, 279
Weve listened closely to all of them and weve looked at all of their records.Only one candidate for president has the determination and toughness to stand up to the corporate gun lobby—and the record to prove it, 279, 316
That candidate is Hillary Clinton." "As a United States senator Hillary voted for laws that keep guns out of the wrong hands and make our communities safer places to live, 316, 346
She voted against protecting gun manufacturers at all costs and insisted on putting the safety of our communities over manufacturers bottom lines, 346, 368
And we believe that as president she will continue working to respect the rights of law-abiding gun owners like us while working to achieve practical solutions like a reliable background check system that prevents dangerous people from getting guns closing loopholes to protect women and families by keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and stalkers and cracking down on the illegal gun trade.?" Hillary and I share a proud tradition of women leading on issues that impact all Americans and getting things done, 368, 453
We have taken on tough races relied on other strong women to have our backs—and we have never ever shied away from a tough fight or a tough vote, 453, 482
"Today Mark and I are proud to have Hillarys back and to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with her to once and for all break the stranglehold the corporate gun lobby has had on American politics—and American families—for too long.?" , 482, 519
