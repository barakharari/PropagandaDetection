A very busy day with two incredible women "I love my job because every day is different, 0, 17
As the digital director for Hillary Clintons campaign in South Carolina my job can mean a lot of different things—from creating and maintaining the campaigns online presence in the state to also spending my days on the trail talking directly to voters volunteers and working with elected officials and celebrities who campaign for Hillary." But this Wednesday was particularly special, 17, 77
At 6 a.m, 77, 80
I found myself climbing into my car to pick up Vivica A, 80, 92
Fox (!) for events across the state, 92, 99
"During the ride to our first stop of the day Vivica and I discussed the reasons shes hitting the trail for Hillary, 99, 121
She talked about how important it is for us to protect all of the progress President Obama has made especially with the Affordable Care Act and the presidents work to reduce gun violence—because these issues disproportionately affect the African American community, 121, 162
She also shared how much she loves Hillarys "  which allocates $25 billion specifically for  , 162, 177
"She made it clear that shes ready to fight for Hillary and I couldnt wait to see Vivica share her passion with the people of South Carolina." During her interview Vivica talked about her roles in the wildly successful television show Empire and the highly-anticipated movie Independence Day: Resurgence—but she also shared the reason she came to Columbia, 177, 235
?I am SO here to support Hillary Clinton? she told Fraendy Clervaud on Good Day Columbia, 235, 251
 "?We have to keep things going forward, 251, 258
? And I just feel that with Secretary Clinton were going to keep going forward.?" She also urged people to make sure their voices are heard in this election, 258, 287
?Make sure that you pay attention, 287, 293
Saturday February 27 is the day to get out and vote, 293, 304
? This election is so important so make sure you go vote.? Vivica then joined all of the hosts to wrap up the show and one host asked her why she chose to spend her time campaigning for Hillary, 304, 343
"?Now youre a very busy lady? the host said, 343, 352
?So what made you decide of all the things you have to do that you had to get behind Hillary??" Before the host could get the whole question out Vivica was answering, 352, 384
"?Because I care about my community and I care about our country, 384, 396
? People think that Im out in Hollywood and that I dont care about the community, 396, 412
Ive always been yalls favorite sister girl who cares about the community, 412, 424
And so Im making sure that they have to understand especially Generation X that their vote counts.? " "Meanwhile Clay Middleton the South Carolina state director was spending the day with Angela Bassett, 424, 457
During Vivicas TV interview I got this message from him." Safe to say that Angela was having a pretty great time on the trail too, 457, 482
"Angela and Vivica both had radio interviews scheduled so we headed to WMFV 95.3 Columbias Inspiration Station." "Clay texted to let me know how Angelas radio interview was going." Clay and Angela met up with us at the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia where both women met with local officials, 482, 532
Angela and Vivica talked with Democratic leaders about the importance of this election, 532, 545
Vivica told everyone that she knew how much of our progress was at stake and she was there to help them make sure we keep a Democrat in the White House, 545, 576
"And when a group of General Assembly members held a press conference to endorse Hillary Angela and Vivica stood alongside them proudly declaring that theyre on Team Hillary too." After that we got back on the road, 576, 613
Vivica and I drove to Voorhees College an HBCU in Denmark, 613, 624
After the event a few students came up to her and said "Im going to vote now!" It was incredibly encouraging to see Vivicas message resonating with students, 624, 652
At the same time Clay was with Angela at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg where a HUGE crowd turned out, 652, 673
"Vivica and I headed to Denmark Tech a two-year technical college where she gave another great speech about all of the ways Hillarys policies will break down barriers for African Americans." And after Angela finished rallying students at Claflin University in Orangeburg Clay told me she got the chance to meet up with some of Delta sorors! Then without missing a beat Vivica and I headed to the young professionals happy hour in Columbia while Angela and Clay made their way to one in Charleston, 673, 758
"By the time we arrived at Kaminskys a bar in Columbia Vivica was more enthusiastic than ever." The bar was packed—there must have been at least 150 people there throughout the night, 758, 790
Vivica took photos with every single person who asked—but not before reminding them to make sure their voices are heard by heading to the polls on February 27 and supporting Hillary, 790, 821
Clay sent me updates throughout the night on the happy hour Angela was hosting in Charleston, 821, 837
"In the car on our way back to her hotel all Vivica could talk about were the events shed be doing the next day, 837, 861
I assumed shed be exhausted—shed had a crazy day on the trail! But she was totally ready to get back out there and keep fighting for Hillary." "?I was so moved by the students who came out and were engaged? she said, 861, 903
?It really means a lot to me that Im taking part in electing Hillary Clinton.? She talked about how important HBCU organizing is to her because she knows that Hillary will make sure all of the students she talked to will have a better life." Vivica and I said our goodbyes for the night after a long day on the road, 903, 964
When I got home Clay sent me this video of two little girls coming to say hi to Angela, 964, 983
One of them complimented her on her Hillary button—and Angela gave it to her, 983, 997
 n This entire day meant so much to me and the South Carolina team, 997, 1011
Vivica A, 1011, 1013
Fox and Angela Bassett spent their time with us because they believe that Hillary Clinton will make it possible for everyone we met to live up to their God-given potential, 1013, 1043
