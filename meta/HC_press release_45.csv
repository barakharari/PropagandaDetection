"In a dogfight Id want Hillary Clinton on my side." The?  and   two of New Hampshires daily newspapers just published a glowing joint endorsement of Hillary Clintons candidacy for president calling her "by far the most qualified candidate seeking the Democratic nomination." Here are six of the reasons Hillary is their presidential pick, 0, 53
"As president there would be no learning curve, 53, 61
She would be in full command of the geopolitical challenges facing our nation from day one, 61, 77
And given the concerns about global instability and terrorism we place a high value on this competence." "Granite State Democrats and independent voters having seen and heard Clinton with their own eyes and ears have rejected the decades of distortions peddled by her political opponents, 77, 122
We know the real Hillary Clinton and we admire and respect her." "She is credited as the architect of the crippling sanctions against Iran that led to the recent nuclear deal, 122, 153
She brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, 153, 161
She was on the front lines of the tragedies and triumphs of the Arab Spring learning hard and valuable lessons, 161, 181
Henry Kissinger President Richard Nixons secretary of state said she ?ran the State Department in the most effective way that Ive ever seen." "When Clinton saw a chance to improve relations with Burma she approached then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell because she knew of his admiration for Aung San Suu Kyi the nations embattled human rights leader, 181, 238
Together Clinton and McConnell made progress opening up this country that had been closed to the United States for decades." "As first lady she led the White Houses effort to implement health care reform and she took a beating as vested interests pushed back against ?Hillarycare, 238, 284
But Clinton proved resilient, 284, 288
The defeat taught her valuable lessons and she put that knowledge to work in her husbands second term working with Massachusetts Democratic Sen, 288, 311
Ted Kennedy and Utah Republican Sen, 311, 317
Orrin Hatch to pass the Childrens Health Insurance Program which insured millions of previously uninsured children." "But unlike her opponent Clintons plans are not all centrally planned and run by the government, 317, 349
They are collaborations: college students work to help pay for their education; energy companies have incentives to change for the good while a safety net is built for displaced coal-state workers, 349, 380
In the spirit of John F, 380, 386
Kennedy government leads the nation toward big goals and taps the aspiration and ingenuity of individuals and the private sector, 386, 406
This is how America makes its greatest progress." , 406, 414
