"Hello Toledo, 0, 2
I am – I am very happy to be here today and – I am so grateful to have this chance to talk to you about what we can do together to have the kind of economy that works for everyone not just those at the top, 2, 49
"I want to acknowledge – we have an overflow crowd in another room and I know they can hear us but were glad theyre here, 49, 74
I want to thank your Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur for her leadership and her grit, 74, 88
I want to thank Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson, 88, 95
And the mayor told me theres a young man here who just won a boxing championship Robert Easter, 95, 113
Wheres Robert Easter? There you are Robert Easter, 113, 121
Congratulations, 121, 122
I know Toledo is proud of you; we all are, 122, 132
I want to thank Kenyetta for that introduction, 132, 140
Do we have any other UAW members here?" "Its a great day to be here in Ohio for a lot of different reasons, 140, 163
One is I am so thrilled that LeBron James has endorsed me and joined our campaign, 163, 179
I know – Ive gotten a lot of wonderful endorsements over the past year and a half, 179, 196
Im grateful for each and every one of them, 196, 205
But I got to say theres something special about this one, 205, 216
And its a real honor in part because of why he chose to endorse me, 216, 231
Now not everyone knows this, 231, 236
I mean you all know what an amazing athlete he his – MVP winner of championships – but hes also – LeBron is also a dedicated advocate for children, 236, 265
And this afternoon Ill be in Akron where hes done so much for the kids in that community." "Its a deep personal commitment that he has that I share with him, 265, 296
We both believe every single child should have the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential, 296, 315
I could not be prouder to have LeBron joining our team as we head into the homestretch." "Now one thing I know – Ill just say it because I know its for sure – I hope to be elected president but I know here in Ohio LeBron will always be the King." I was listening to Kenyetta introduce me and I really appreciated what she said because Toledo is the kind of place where people work hard look after one another and yes pay their taxes right? You recognize that we all have to do our part because we are all in this together and it matters, 315, 422
We believe honest work deserves honest pay, 422, 429
We believe everyone should have the right to join a strong union that will always have your back, 429, 447
"Its personal for me, 447, 451
Im the granddaughter of a factory worker from Scranton Pennsylvania, 451, 461
He went to work in the same lace mill every day for 50 years, 461, 475
He believed he passed it down to my dad who passed it down to me that if he did what he was supposed to do hed have a good life and his kids would have an even better life, 475, 514
That is the American dream, 514, 519
That is what we believe in, 519, 525
Thats what weve got to keep going generation after generation." "And because of my grandfathers hard work my dad made it to college, 525, 548
And then after serving in the Navy during World War II he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies." "As a young girl Id sometimes go to his print plant, 548, 580
It was a long building no natural light no windows but he had these long tables where hed roll out the fabric and then Id watch him work with silkscreens if youve ever seen that, 580, 615
He would take the silkscreen hed put it down hed pour the paint in hed take the squeegee go across all the way down to the end of one table then over to the next table all the way back, 615, 655
And then if there was a second color to be added he would do that, 655, 670
He sometimes let me help with the squeegee, 670, 678
That was my favorite part." And I know he worked really hard, 678, 690
He worked really hard, 690, 694
He believed in hard work, 694, 699
He passed that on to me, 699, 705
He provided a good middle-class life for us, 705, 713
So I am proud to stand with hardworking families all over Toledo Ohio and America who should have the same chance that I did to share in the American Dream which should be big enough for everybody, 713, 750
"Fighting for kids and families has been the cause of my life as Kenyetta said when I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund all those years ago, 750, 779
And it will be the mission of my presidency because I want to focus on what are called kitchen table issues the ones that keep you up at night – like the cost of child care and college and prescription drugs and so much else." "And that means weve got to create more good jobs with rising incomes, 779, 837
That means weve got to have good schools in every zip code, 837, 849
That means everybody willing to work – and I say that very clearly; youve got to be willing to work – and if youre willing to work you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead, 849, 886
That is the basic bargain." "Now I dont know about you but you wouldnt think that the theme of my campaign getting an economy to work for everyone not just those at the top would be controversial – and yet this is one of the defining debates not just of this election but of our time." Now I will say most American companies – most – are run by honorable patriotic people who care about their employees and communities, 886, 965
But there are still too many powerful interests fighting to protect their own profits and privileges at the expense of everyone else, 965, 987
Applause, 987, 988
And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers workers small businesses and taxpayers, 988, 1019
"That makes it tougher for the well-meaning CEOs to take the high road, 1019, 1032
And it gets even harder when we dont aggressively enforce the rules when we dont enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up when we dont enforce rules on Wall Street which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value investing in workers plant and equipment over the longer term." "And lets be honest the tax code rewards corporations for outsourcing jobs and their profits overseas instead of investing here in the United States, 1032, 1128
And it is riddled with loopholes that let the rich get even richer and make income inequality even worse, 1128, 1147
It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that cant afford lawyers and lobbyists." "So with all these pressures pushing in the wrong direction its even more important that we have an election about these very issues, 1147, 1185
Because what I know will happen – if we have an election where we have an agenda that actually would begin to level that playing field we will rebuild the middle class we will make work pay we will create greater opportunities for a great percentage of Americans." Now I know how hard this but I think we are on the cusp if we win this election to be able to get these things done right?"  "Yeah."  "That means pursuing reforms that unleash the enormous positive potential of the American private sector, 1185, 1277
Weve got unmatched talent innovation entrepreneurial spirit, 1277, 1284
So when we work together we can all benefit, 1284, 1293
"Now I believe corporations that benefit from everything America has to offer should feel some sense of responsibility not just to their biggest shareholders – but to their workers to their customers to their communities and yes to our country to the United States of America, 1293, 1339
We have been moving off track for decades, 1339, 1347
I dont need to tell you that, 1347, 1354
You know it youve lived it youve seen it, 1354, 1363
But it is time to get back on track." "And you can ask anybody whos ever worked for me or worked with me whos ever served with me when I tell you Im going to try to do something I will get up every single day and work my heart out for you." "So lets begin by making it clear that for most businesses America is the most important asset on their balance sheet, 1363, 1437
This country of ours this system of ours the rule of law the opportunity to get an education and go as far as your hard work and ambition will take you, 1437, 1468
And we created the biggest engine of economic growth in the world the American middle class, 1468, 1484
So when we middle class thrives the country thrives, 1484, 1493
And when it doesnt we dont right?" "And Im going to use the White House and every tool at my disposal as your president to make the case that patriotism is profitable, 1493, 1525
Standing up for America investing in America will pay off." Now we have always had innovators and entrepreneurs who build great companies and create real value, 1525, 1551
But we should not and we will not respect those who get rich by cheating everybody else, 1551, 1568
So today I want to send a clear message to every boardroom every executive suite across America: If you scam your customers exploit your employees pollute our environment or rip off taxpayers we will find ways to hold you accountable, 1568, 1608
"But on the other side – on the other side if you do the right thing and you invest in your workers and your communities and our countrys future we will stand with you, 1608, 1642
That is the choice, 1642, 1646
Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to do better." "Now to understand why this is so important consider the recent examples weve seen of egregious corporate behavior." "Look at Wells Fargo, 1646, 1680
Really shocking isnt it? One of the nations biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers secretly opening up millions of accounts for people without their consent even their knowledge misusing personal information and then sticking customers with hidden fees, 1680, 1724
It is outrageous that eight years after a cowboy culture on Wall Street wrecked our economy we are still seeing powerful bankers playing fast and loose with the law." "And then in a category by himself theres Donald Trump, 1724, 1763
Well you may have heard that he has long refused to release his tax returns the way every other nominee for president has done for decades, 1763, 1789
You can look at 40 years of my tax returns, 1789, 1799
I think we need a law that says if you become the nominee of the major parties you have to release your tax returns." "Now a lot of us were wondering what is he hiding? It must be really terrible, 1799, 1839
Well The New York Times has discovered at least part of the answer, 1839, 1852
Back in the 1990s Trump apparently lost a billion dollars in a single year on bad investments and failing casinos, 1852, 1872
Now how anybody can lose a dollar let alone a billion dollars in the casino industry is kind of beyond me, 1872, 1893
Its just hard to figure, 1893, 1898
But as a result it doesnt look like he paid a dime of federal income tax for almost two decades." "Now while millions of American families including mine and yours were working hard paying our fair share it seems he was contributing nothing to our nation, 1898, 1944
Imagine that, 1944, 1946
Not fair, 1946, 1948
Nothing for Pell Grants to help kids go to college, 1948, 1958
Nothing for veterans, 1958, 1961
Nothing for our military, 1961, 1965
And you know he has been dissing America in this whole campaign, 1965, 1977
Right? He talks us down, 1977, 1982
He makes disparaging comments about our country, 1982, 1989
He calls our military a disaster, 1989, 1995
Well its not but it might have been if everybody else had failed to pay taxes to support our brave men and women in uniform." "I saw a newspaper article, 1995, 2025
A gentleman named Steve Crouse who owns the Glass City Café here in Toledo summed it up pretty well in this article, 2025, 2047
He said I would feel guilty if I didnt pay anything, 2047, 2058
Its flat-out cheating the government, 2058, 2063
Now my friend Bernie Sanders was right yesterday when he said Trump reflects a distorted view of the American people and what this country is all about." "Trump represents the same rigged system that he claims hes going to change, 2063, 2103
The whole story tells us everything we need to know about how Trump does business, 2103, 2118
After he made all those bad bets and lost all that money he didnt lift a finger to help and protect his employees or all the small businesses and contractors hed hired or the people of Atlantic City, 2118, 2156
They all got hammered while he was busy with his accountants trying to figure out how he could keep living like a billionaire, 2156, 2179
And all the while he was using his political connections to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in government subsidies and extra tax breaks for his companies, 2179, 2206
In other words Trump was taking from America with both hands and leaving the rest of us with the bill." "Now he says that hes the one who can fix things but that is like letting the fox guard the henhouse, 2206, 2247
Right? And heres what I really am just stunned by, 2247, 2257
I get stunned every day in this campaign, 2257, 2265
But heres one of the many things that Im stunned by, 2265, 2276
He has put forth a tax plan that would cut his own taxes even more, 2276, 2291
It would be like youre paying zero, 2291, 2298
You expect us to pay you to stay in business all the rest of us in America? Hed open the loopholes even wider, 2298, 2321
And according to a new independent study he would actually – listen to this people because this is a real shocker – his plan would actually raise taxes for millions of middle class families, 2321, 2355
And you know the people it would hit the hardest? Are single parents whose lives and challenges he doesnt care about certainly doesnt understand." "Now many have likely already spent years paying more than he did and he now would make that even worse, 2355, 2399
And what does he say about it? Well did you all see the debate last Monday? Well in the debate – in the debate – well then you all know that in the debate he said it was smart to avoid paying taxes, 2399, 2442
Yesterday his campaign was bragging it makes him a genius, 2442, 2452
Heres my question: What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year?" "This is Trump to a T, 2452, 2473
Hes taken corporate excess and makes a business model out of it, 2473, 2485
He abuses his power games the system puts his own interests ahead of the countrys, 2485, 2500
Its Trump first and everyone else last, 2500, 2507
And there are lots of principled law-abiding business leaders out there who are horrified by all of this, 2507, 2525
Not a single – not a single CEO of a Fortune 100 company supports Trumps campaign, 2525, 2541
Think about it, 2541, 2544
Ive been endorsed by very successful people – Warren Buffett Mike Bloomberg Mark Cuban, 2544, 2558
I loved what Mark Cuban said when he endorsed me, 2558, 2568
He said Look Ive been successful, 2568, 2574
He actually is a real billionaire, 2574, 2580
And you know what? He used profit-sharing to help his employees not bankruptcy to fire people, 2580, 2596
And when he sold his first company he shared the profits with his employees and 300 of them became millionaires, 2596, 2616
Thats the kind of business practices I want to see more of in our country." "But heres what weve got to do, 2616, 2638
Even if Trump is like one of a kind weve got to reverse the broader trends he represents, 2638, 2656
Its time to rewrite the rules and make this economy fair for everyone, 2656, 2669
And today I want to briefly share with you my plan for protecting taxpayers consumers small businesses and workers, 2669, 2688
Were going to crack down on the worst corporate abuses and empower companies willing to take the high road and invest in good jobs in higher wages and in stronger communities." "First lets start with protecting taxpayers and making sure we have more fairness in the system, 2688, 2735
It is wrong that corporations and the super-wealthy play by a different set of rules, 2735, 2750
A Wall Street money manager should not be able to pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a nurse, 2750, 2771
And Ill tell you something else, 2771, 2777
Our largest companies should not be able to get away with paying hardly anything at all, 2777, 2793
It is insulting when they engage in these games like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country – on paper not in reality – just to take advantage of lower tax rates, 2793, 2826
And it is infuriating when they take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips in America with the other hand." "So heres what were going to do, 2826, 2856
Were going to close those loopholes, 2856, 2862
Ive got a list of them were going after, 2862, 2871
Were going to make Wall Street corporations and the super-rich start paying their fair share of taxes, 2871, 2888
Were going to pass something called the Buffett rule which means multimillionaires cannot lower rates than their secretaries and other people working for them, 2888, 2912
Were going to put in place a new exit tax, 2912, 2922
If companies try to leave our country to avoid paying their fair share if they try to outsource jobs theyre going to have to give back every tax break they ever received in our country, 2922, 2957
And then were going to put that money to work creating opportunities here in America." "Second were going to protect consumers, 2957, 2978
No American should ever be taken advantage of like thousands were by Wells Fargo, 2978, 2992
And this isnt a new fight for me, 2992, 3000
As a Senator I raised the alarm about subprime mortgages, 3000, 3010
I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids, 3010, 3027
I introduced legislation to protect Americans personal data and combat identity theft, 3027, 3039
So as president I will make consumer protection a top priority across the entire government." "And that starts by defending and empowering the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-reau which was created after the financial crisis, 3039, 3073
And the principal person who got it created was Senator Elizabeth Warren, 3073, 3085
And under the leadership of Ohios Rich Cordray the agency has already returned more than $11 billion to more than 15 million Americans who were ripped off by predatory lenders credit card companies and others, 3085, 3120
And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back." "Now I got to say I am so proud of what this new agency has done, 3120, 3153
Sometimes people say well what does the government really do? Well theres a lot of examples but this is a primary one standing up and making sure consumers get paid back when they are ripped off, 3153, 3189
And because of its success Republicans in Congress keep trying to shut it down, 3189, 3203
And Donald Trump agrees with them, 3203, 3209
In fact he wants to scrap all the tough new rules imposed on Wall Street after the crisis, 3209, 3227
Well not on my watch Donald, 3227, 3233
Were never going to let that happen." Now instead of gutting consumer protection we should be expanding it, 3233, 3251
And we should build on the Dodd-Frank financial reforms and go even further because Wall Street can never ever be permitted to threaten Main Street again, 3251, 3277
And the Wells Fargo scandal sheds light on another threat to consumers that we have to address, 3277, 3294
When the scams victims people like you and me who had accounts there tried to sue they were shocked to learn there was a provision in the very fine print of their contracts that kept them from going to court to sue the bank for being cheated, 3294, 3341
Instead they are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections that you get in a court of law, 3341, 3362
We are not going to let corporations like Wells Fargo use these fine print "gotchas" to escape accountability, 3362, 3380
"And in fact this is now common practice across a lot of industries – from nursing homes nursing homes that mistreat seniors to for-profit colleges that defraud students, 3380, 3408
Who reads all that fine print? I dont, 3408, 3416
And you get defrauded or you get mistreated and then all of a sudden they say Well you cant sue us, 3416, 3437
So were going to rein in that abuse across everybody." "We also see a similar problem in some international trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 3437, 3462
It sets up a dispute resolution system that favors large corporations over everyone else, 3462, 3476
Its one of the reasons Im against it, 3476, 3484
Ive warned about this for years Ive written about it and I oppose TPP now I will oppose it after the election I will oppose it as president – because it is one-sided and unfair to American workers." "And what about all those pharmaceutical companies that jack up prices for no reason? Were going to have to protect ourselves against that too, 3484, 3546
And when we find unjustified spikes in the prices of longstanding life-saving drugs we should slap penalties on companies trying to cheat people who need those drugs." "And lets finally import safe alternatives from other countries like Canada and speed up approvals to get more generic drugs on the market, 3546, 3596
And it is long past time to allow Medicare to negotiate for better prices for drugs and get the cost down for Medicare recipients, 3596, 3620
And I believe we should cap the amount working families pay out of pocket every month for medicine, 3620, 3638
No one should ever have to choose between paying the rent and filling their prescriptions." "So lets stand up for taxpayers, 3638, 3659
Lets stand up for consumers, 3659, 3664
And lets stand up for small businesses which create most of the jobs in America, 3664, 3679
I take this personally be-cause of my dads very small business, 3679, 3690
We need fair rules of the road so big corporations cant use their power to gain unfair advantages." "Now when it comes to bullying small businesses Donald Trump is the poster boy, 3690, 3722
I have heard so many stories of contractors and Ive met some too who worked for him produced the goods and services and never got paid for what they were owed, 3722, 3753
Im talking about painters and plumbers piano sellers architects glass installers – he stiffed them all, 3753, 3769
Not because he couldnt pay them but he wouldnt pay them, 3769, 3780
And he told them You want to get your money? Sue me, 3780, 3792
My dad could never have done that, 3792, 3799
Im just grateful my dad never got a contract with Donald Trump because I dont know what we would have done." "More than 60 percent of small businesses face payment delays, 3799, 3830
That can cause a serious cash flow crisis, 3830, 3838
So as president I will explore new ways to arm small businesses with the tools to fight back and level the playing field, 3838, 3861
Part of the problem is large corporations are amassing so much power in our economy, 3861, 3876
Sometimes its called market concentration or even old-fashioned monopolies but either way it threatens businesses of all sizes as well as consumers, 3876, 3898
With less competition corporations can use their power to raise prices limit choice for consumers cut wages for workers crowd out startups and small businesses." "I mean look whats happening right now, 3898, 3930
In most of the country the three largest health insurance companies in each state control 80 percent of the market, 3930, 3950
No wonder premiums are going up, 3950, 3956
As president I will appoint tough independent authorities to strengthen anti-trust enforcement and really scrutinize mergers and acquisitions so the big dont keep getting bigger and bigger." "I want every business to compete and thrive and then I also want to do something else, 3956, 4000
Lets protect and empower workers who actually drive our economy, 4000, 4010
Everyone who works hard should be able to share in the rewards not just senior executives, 4010, 4026
So were proposing new tax credits to encourage more companies to share profits on top of not instead of higher wages." "We need to support new organizing strategies for employees who too often have never had the benefit of collective bargaining, 4026, 4067
And we have to resist the assault on workers rights, 4067, 4077
Lets say loudly and clearly: right to work is wrong for workers and wrong for America." "Lets also my friends lets raise the minimum wage and support the Fight for 15 so you dont live in poverty, 4077, 4114
Lets defend overtime and go after wage theft, 4114, 4122
Lets provide family leave that is paid and access to affordable high-quality childcare, 4122, 4135
And of course you know what Im going to say: lets finally guarantee equal pay for women." "Now my opponent and his chief surrogates like to say Im playing the womans card, 4135, 4167
And Ill tell you – right? – if fighting for working families is playing the womens card you know what? Deal me in!" "And then finally Ive got a lot on my mind but finally we need to make it easier for companies to invest in good jobs here at home, 4167, 4218
As president I will ramp up enforcement of trade rules by appointing a new chief trade prosecutor and tripling the number of enforcement officers, 4218, 4242
We will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good-paying jobs since World War II, 4242, 4261
I want to direct $10 billion to create a Make It in America partnership to support American manufacturing, 4261, 4279
And I want to take some of the ideas that worked when my husband was President and we ended up with 23 million new jobs and incomes went up for everybody." "That includes incentives like the New Markets Tax Credit for creating good jobs in poor or remote areas from inner cities to rural communities ravaged – ravaged – by hollowed-out factories ravaged by mines that have been shut down ravaged by opiate addiction, 4279, 4353
It all comes down to this: When I say our economy should work for everyone not just those at the top I mean it, 4353, 4377
And were going to do everything we can to make sure workers are treated like assets not costs, 4377, 4395
And were going to bring back infrastructure jobs advanced manufacturing jobs clean renewable energy jobs innovation technology small business." "Now you dont have to look any further than right here in Northwest Ohio, 4395, 4428
Just a few years ago as you heard Kenyetta say in 2009 you were in the eye of the storm, 4428, 4448
Jobs homes savings wiped out, 4448, 4453
The auto industry on the verge of collapse, 4453, 4461
A lot of people were ready to give up on it, 4461, 4472
Well that would have meant giving up on 850000 people across this state whose jobs were tied to the industry, 4472, 4492
Donald Trump for one said rescuing the auto industry didnt matter very much, 4492, 4505
Either way would have been acceptable he said, 4505, 4513
We could have just let it go and thats a direct quote from him, 4513, 4527
Everybody in Ohio whos thinking about voting for Trump needs to hear that, 4527, 4540
At the time of the worst financial crisis in Ohio in 2009 he would have let you twist and fall, 4540, 4560
And for his running mate he picked Mike Pence an ardent opponent of the auto rescue, 4560, 4576
Well thank goodness the people of Northwest Ohio werent ready to let it go, 4576, 4590
You never gave up, 4590, 4594
You didnt lose faith, 4594, 4598
And now after a lot of hard work and sacrifice the auto industry just had its best year ever." "But thats not all there is to the story because in addition to that hard work America America came to the rescue, 4598, 4639
Taxpayers like all of us not him but us provided the funds for the rescue, 4639, 4654
Union workers stepped up, 4654, 4658
Communities like Toledo came together to make it work, 4658, 4667
And now that the industrys back on its feet the auto companies have a responsibility to give back." "So I was delighted to hear that Chrysler is doubling down on Toledo investing $700 million here to start building the next generation Jeep Wrangler which could create about 700 new good jobs, 4667, 4718
