" Were joined now by his "  opponent former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 0, 14
She joins us now from Manchester as well, 14, 22
Madam Secretary thank you for joining us this morning, 22, 31
So you have had your own turn on "Saturday Night Live." How did he do? " Well I didnt get to see it but its always a fun experience, 31, 60
Im sure he did great, 60, 65
You know its a wonderful forum, 65, 71
Its a crash course in trying to figure out how to do live TV, 71, 85
And I had a great time doing it." " We also had of course the Republican debate last night here at St, 85, 107
Anselms, 107, 108
And Marco Rubio called you out on the issue of abortion, 108, 119
Take a look."   " Why doesnt the media ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that all abortions should be legal even on the due date of that unborn child? Why dont they ask Hillary Clinton why she believes that partial birth abortion which is a gruesome procedure that has been outlawed in this country she thinks thats a fundamental right, 119, 179
They are the extremists when it comes to the issue of abortion and I cant wait to expose them in a general election."    Are you going to get exposed in a general election?  You know George I — its really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign, 179, 231
Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can, 231, 244
You know Ive been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion how it should be safe and legal and I have the same position that Ive had for a very long time, 244, 280
But whats really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn "Roe v, 280, 304
Wade" to defund Planned Parenthood to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme.., 304, 318
 But are there any.., 318, 322
 — and I — I think the Amer.., 322, 330
 — restrictions you would accept on late-term abortions? " Well you know Ive been on the record on this for a long time, 330, 353
You know I think that the life and health of the mother obviously rape and incest have to be always taken into account, 353, 376
And you know when he raises the you know very very difficult issue of late-term abortion he conveniently overlooks the fact that there are medical reasons there are health-related reasons, 376, 406
Ive met women who have had to face this excruciating choice, 406, 417
This is not something that anyone that Ive ever met with enters into without the deepest thought the most careful consideration, 417, 438
And I remember at an event back in the 90s where you know we sat and talked with some of the women who had to make a very hard decision, 438, 468
You know its — its just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of very difficult concerns."  You.., 468, 492
" And I dont think he should be allowed to get away with that." " You had your own debate with Bernie Sanders this week as well, 492, 519
And he challenged — you challenged him to come up with evidence that contributions from Wall Street ever influenced your positions, 519, 540
He and his team have circulated the charge from Elizabeth Warren who said you changed your position on the bankruptcy bill back in 2001 because of contributions, 540, 567
Heres what Senator Warren had to say."    One of the first bills that came up after she was Senator Clinton was the bankruptcy bill, 567, 591
 And?  She voted in favor of it, 591, 598
She has taken money from the groups, 598, 605
And more to the point she worries about them as a constituency, 605, 617
   How do you respond to that charge? " Well Im glad you asked me about it because this is one of these you know innuendo insinuation charges that the Sanders campaign is engaging in."  Well that was Senator Warren though, 617, 657
" If you — no but — but I know, 657, 667
But if you had played the entire quote you know what you would have heard her say she and I worked together in 2000 to stop a bankruptcy bill that we both believed was very harmful, 667, 703
When I got to the Senate in 2001 one of the first big votes there was on a version of the bankruptcy bill and I was deluged by womens groups and childrens advocates groups to do everything I could to make sure that child support and womens precarious financial situation in case of divorce or not being able to get the kind of funding they needed from a partner or a spouse in bankruptcy would not be endangered, 703, 781
And it was, 781, 784
The current — that bill was making it a very low priority, 784, 796
So I did go to work on behalf of all these womens groups and childrens groups because they needed a champion, 796, 817
And I got that bill changed, 817, 823
And in return it had nothing to do with any money whatsoever — and I resent deeply any effort by the Sanders campaign to so imply..."  But.., 823, 850
 It had to do with trying to get a deal.., 850, 860
" But thats not what..." " — that would protect women, 860, 871
But now let me finish George because this has been bandied about and I just want to set the record straight, 871, 892
And so then three years later part of the — part of what Senator — Senator Warren said you played, 892, 912
You didnt play the whole thing because weve been allies, 912, 922
I faced a tough decision and I stood up for women and children, 922, 935
I went to the Senate floor said that was exactly what I was doing, 935, 949
Then the bill did not pass, 949, 955
It never became law, 955, 959
And then when the next bill came up 2005 womens issues were taken care of because I had made that a point back in 2001, 959, 984
And so then I was against that bill, 984, 992
I didnt get a chance to actually vote against it because Bill was in the hospital having a heart procedure, 992, 1012
But I put a statement out, 1012, 1018
I was against it, 1018, 1022
So Im happy to set this record straight, 1022, 1030
And I really want to once again call out the Sanders campaign which claims they like to run a positive campaign, 1030, 1051
But they have been quite artful in raising questions and trying to cast doubts about my record, 1051, 1068
And I really am not going to sit and take it anymore —"  But Senator — " I have a public record, 1068, 1090
I have never ever been influenced in a view or a vote by anyone who has given me any kind of money, 1090, 1112
So Im just going to keep setting the record straight." " But in her book Senator Warren said the bill was essentially the same but Hillary Clinton — Hillary Rodham Clinton was not, 1112, 1145
Big banks were now part of Secretary Clintons consistency, 1145, 1154
She wanted their support, 1154, 1158
They wanted hers including —" " George look I — look I have the greatest — I have the greatest respect for Senator Warren, 1158, 1182
As I said we did work together, 1182, 1189
I faced a choice, 1189, 1193
I could have said to the women who have been my advocates for 30 years Im sorry; Im now in the Senate, 1193, 1215
But you know I cant help you, 1215, 1222
Nobody else is helping them, 1222, 1227
They were desperate to get help, 1227, 1233
They were afraid that child support was going to be below credit card debt that they were going to be really left out and left behind and badly damaged, 1233, 1262
I could have said you know I cant do that because somebody in 10 years might say that you know something else is going on, 1262, 1287
Thats not the way I work, 1287, 1293
So they came to me; I said this is outrageous, 1293, 1303
I went to the floor, 1303, 1308
I lobbied to get a change, 1308, 1314
And as part of getting that change from both Democrats and Republicans who were leading that legislation they said if we change this bill at the last minute to take account of these issues youre raising about women and children which they had not clearly made a priority before I showed up then you know you have to say youll vote for it, 1314, 1377
It was — you know look thats what you have to do, 1377, 1389
I swallowed hard; I said OK, 1389, 1395
But it was also the case it didnt get passed, 1395, 1405
So I got what I needed into the bill, 1405, 1414
It stayed in the bill even in the bad version that I posed in 2005, 1414, 1429
So thanks for the opportunity to set the record straight." " In the debate the other night you said youd look into whether or not to release the transcripts of your speeches to financial groups, 1429, 1464
Have you made up your mind?" " Yes you know heres another thing I want to say, 1464, 1481
Let everybody whos ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them, 1481, 1497
Well all release them at the same time, 1497, 1505
You know I dont mind being the subject in Republican debates the subject in the Democratic primary, 1505, 1522
That kind of goes with the territory, 1522, 1529
Ive been around long enough, 1529, 1534
But at some point you know these rules need to apply to everybody, 1534, 1547
And there are a bunch of folks including you know my opponent whos given you know speeches to groups and people on the other side whove given speeches to groups, 1547, 1577
Let — if this is now going to be a new standard so then it should apply to everybody and then Ill be happy to look into it further."  Madam Secretary thanks very much for your time this morning, 1577, 1616
 Great to talk to you George thanks, 1616, 1623
