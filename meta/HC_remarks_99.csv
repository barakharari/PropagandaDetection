Wow! What a night, 0, 4
An unbelievable night, 4, 7
What a great campaign, 7, 11
This has been an incredible honor to campaign across Iowa with so many of you to make the case for the kind of future we want, 11, 37
"For the Democratic Party and for the United States of America, 37, 48
There is so much at stake in this election I dont need to tell you, 48, 63
Every single one of you who came out for me who worked so many hours — from my young organizers with energy and passion to the families and friends across this state — I am deeply grateful." "I love all of you, 63, 105
Heres what I want you to know, 105, 112
It is rare that we have the opportunity we do now to have a real contest of ideas, 112, 130
To really think hard about what the Democratic Party stands for and what we want the future of our country to look like if we do our part to build it." "I am a progressive who gets things done for people, 130, 171
I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough, 171, 196
That standing still is not an option, 196, 203
And that brings people together to find ways forward that will improve the lives of Americans, 203, 219
I look back over the years of my involvement from the very first job I had at the Childrens Defense Fund, 219, 240
And I know, 240, 243
I know what we are capable of doing I know we can create more good paying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking Americans again, 243, 267
I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage for every single man woman and child." "I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century, 267, 304
I know we can make our education system work for every one of our children especially those who come with disadvantages, 304, 325
I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people, 325, 342
And I know we can protect our rights womens rights gay rights voting rights immigrant rights workers rights, 342, 360
I know too we can stand up to the gun lobby and get common sense gun safety measures." And how do we do that? We do that by securing the nomination and then we do it by winning and going into that White House as others before have determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as Americans, 360, 423
"I congratulate my esteemed friends and opponents; I wish Governor OMalley the very best, 423, 437
He is a great public servant who has served Maryland and our country and I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America, 437, 474
In the last few weeks we finally began to have what I think is one of the most important substantive conversations that the Democratic party could have, 474, 501
And I am thrilled at all of the people who are playing a part in that." I know that we may have differences of opinion about how best to achieve our goals, 501, 533
But I believe we have a very clear idea that the Democratic Party and this campaign stands for what is best in America, 533, 556
And we have to be united, 556, 562
When it is all said and done we have to be united, 562, 574
"A Republican vision and candidates that would drive us apart and divide us, 574, 587
That is not who we are my friends, 587, 595
I follow their candidates very closely I understand what theyre appealing to and I intend to stand against it, 595, 614
I will not — I will not let their decisiveness their efforts to rip away the progress that weve made be successful, 614, 636
Because we cant afford that, 636, 641
As I stand here tonight breathing a big sigh of relief thank you Iowa, 641, 655
I want you to know I will keep doing what I have done my entire life." "I will keep standing up for you, 655, 678
I will keep fighting for you, 678, 684
I will always work to achieve the America that I believe in where the promise of that dream that we hold out to our children and our grandchildren never fades but inspires generations to come, 684, 719
Join me lets go win the nomination, 719, 726
Thank you all and God bless you." , 726, 733
