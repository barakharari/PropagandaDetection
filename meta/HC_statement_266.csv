Sitting in a park with their friends.Riding the bus home from school, 34, 46
Watching TV in their living rooms, 46, 52
Working at their desks, 52, 56
They are our friends our neighbors our family, 56, 64
"Across our country Americans are standing up and saying: enough is enough, 64, 76

We will not back down, 305, 310
