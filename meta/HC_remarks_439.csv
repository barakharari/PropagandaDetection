Hello Broward County!Whoa, 0, 3
It is so great to be back in Florida, 3, 12
There are just 14 days two weeks from today.n "The most important election in our lifetimes, 12, 28
Im so grateful to see all of you and I want to thank the elected officials who are here Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultn" "Congressman Alcee Hastings Congressman Ted Deutch Commissioner Mark Bogen and others who are here along with Senator Bill Nelsons wonderful wife Grace Nelson, 28, 73
So we are glad you are all here with me.n" And I got to tell you I was thrilled to be introduced by the person I hope will be the next senator from the great state of Florida Congressman Patrick Murphy.You know I think Patrick is exactly the kind of senator that Florida needs and deserves because he will help us break through gridlock and create more good jobs with rising incomes, 73, 145
And Patrick knows we have to build an economy from the middle out and the bottom up not from the top down.n "I also appreciate the fact that we now are seeing an emerging bipartisan consensus that we need to fix our broken criminal justice system do you agree? But its going to take strong and committed leaders like Patrick Murphy who are ready to show up and fight hard and work to get this done, 145, 221
And -- and this is important my friends unlike his opponent Patrick Murphy has never been afraid to stand up to Donald Trump.n" "I think Florida deserves a senator whos going to fight for comprehensive immigration reform that will keep families together against a deportation force.n" "This is what is so unimaginable of law enforcement officials to go door to door house to house business to business school to school rounding up 11 million people, 221, 296
I think that is so wrong and it is not going to happen in America, 296, 311
So you deserve also a senator who actually believes climate change is real as opposed to someone who every time hes asked says well Im not a scientist, 311, 339
And I always wonder why dont you talk to a scientist? Like start here at Broward College you could talk to scientists.n" And you deserve a senator who would never say that Social Security and Medicare have and this is a quote "weakened us as a people."n "His solution Patricks opponents solution is to privatize Medicare.n"  Boo!n " That is exactly the right response but dont boo vote right?n" "And you deserve a senator who would never support cutting $360 million from Floridas schools because Patrick knows every child in Florida deserves a world-class education, 339, 434
So my friends Patrick Murphy is a smart tough-minded legislator and an independent voice.n" "Thats what we need more of in Washington people like Patrick who are going to get up every day and go to work for you a better life for you and your families instead of blocking progress at every turn listening to the special interests and powerful forces that really are not interested in what its going to take for every one of you to get ahead and stay ahead.n" So please when you get out and vote please remember you can send Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate and you will be glad you did.n "Now I know theres an overflow crowd outside and Im so sorry they cant be in but Im told that they can hear us and maybe even see us and I want to thank them for coming as well.n" I got to ask you did anybody see the last debate?n Well the good news -- the good news was it was the last debate.n  Happy birthday to you!n  Well thank you!n "Thank you, 434, 618
Yeah you know youre right, 618, 623
That last debate was like an early birthday present right? But heres what I wanted you to remember, 623, 641
I stood next to Donald Trump for four and a half hours proving once again I have the stamina to be president and commander- in-chief.n" You know I tried as much as I could to talk about all issues that are on your minds that I believe we can work together to improve, 641, 694
And in fact my wonderful running mate I Senator Tim Kaine wrote a book called "Stronger Together" and we put all of our policies in it because I want you to know what were going to try to do if were so fortunate enough to be the next president and vice president.n "And I think its important because I want you to have confidence that were going to work every day to implement the plans that we have put forth, 694, 774
And I tried in the debate to draw the contrasts with Donald Trump who doesnt really have very many plans, 774, 794
You know Ive tried to run a campaign based on issues hes run a campaign based on insults, 794, 812
And so in the debate we didnt have a lot to talk about other than he continued true to form to throw out his insults.n" "But in that last debate he said something that I found horrifying, 812, 849
Well he said a lot of things cut theres one thing in particular that I wanted to point out because no presidential candidate Republican or Democrat has ever said this, 849, 879
He refused to say that he would respect the outcome the election.n" "I guess we shouldnt be too surprised this is the same guy who said he thought the Emmys were rigged against him, 879, 913
But this is serious, 913, 917
You know on January 20th the first thing a president does is to take an oath to preserve protect and defend the Constitution and I have serious doubts about whether Donald Trump even understands what that means.n" "In America we dont say were going to keep you in suspense about whether we will respect the outcome of an election, 917, 976
We have free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power, 976, 988
That is one thing that makes American great it makes America who we are.n" "And we dont impose religious tests at our borders because we are a country that was founded on religious liberty, 988, 1022
And we dont punish newspapers or journalists that try to cover the news or are critical of politicians or threaten to restrict the First Amendment because our democracy depends on a free press, 1022, 1055
And we dont incite violence and turn people against each other, 1055, 1066
We respect the open exchange of ideas that a democracy depends on.n" "You know Ive got to say I bet some of you or maybe your parents or your grandpar-ents came from places where none of that was true right? There is a reason why America is the greatest and longest lasting democracy the world has ever known because we believe that no matter what you look like or where your parents were born or who you love you have the right to be treated equally and fairly in the United States.n" "And Donald Trump is attacking everything that has set our country apart for 240 years, 1066, 1173
Now after spending his entire campaign attacking one group of Americans after another -- immigrants African Americans Latinos women POWs Muslims people with disabilities -- now his final target is democracy itself, 1173, 1205
So heres what I want you to know in the four years we are going to change some things in America right?n" "I do want to get the economy working for everyone not just those at the top, 1205, 1243
And were going to do that along with other positive changes but we are not going to change the fundamental values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.n" You know I think it all started -- I think this all started when George Washington re-fused to become a king, 1243, 1297
Right? Now Donald Trump probably would have called him a loser.n "Instead that was one of the most important decisions any president has ever made, 1297, 1322
Eight years its time to move on, 1322, 1329
We fought a revolution so that we would not have a king, 1329, 1341
We would not be subjects we would be independent citizens, 1341, 1351
I cherish that idea.n" "So heres the good news, 1351, 1360
Americans are coming together, 1360, 1364
At the very moment when Donald Trump is making an unprecedented attack on our democracy millions of people are registering voting early and volunteering in this campaign.n" "And heres something very exciting, 1364, 1396
We have reached a milestone, 1396, 1401
More than 200 million Americans are now registered and that includes 15 million young people the most ever in history.n" And you know what? More than six million people have already voted and more than one million of them are right here in Florida.n So I think you only see numbers like this when people are standing up for what they really believe in and that includes not just Democrats but Republicans and Independents coming together to reject hate and division and I am so excited about what that means.n "But the energy we are seeing across Florida and America is not just because of what we are against its about what were for, 1401, 1515
It really is, 1515, 1518
Its about fighting for that future where everyone counts everyone has a place and no one is left out or behind, 1518, 1539
But I want you to know we still have a lot of work to do, 1539, 1554
I feel good but boy I am not taking anything for granted, 1554, 1566
Im going to work as hard as I can between now and the close of the election thats two weeks from today.n" "And you know its so important for Florida, 1566, 1596
There are so many issues that we need to remind people about, 1596, 1608
Last time I was here I campaigned with Al Gore and he said a lot about the climate crisis, 1608, 1627
And you know why? Because were seeing the reality of climate change every day in Florida, 1627, 1643
We are seeing areas in Miami even on sunny days without a drop of rain where the streets are flooding, 1643, 1663
And the ocean is rising.n" "And what weve got to do is make sure that this issue -- fighting climate change creating clean renewable energy jobs -- stays at the top of the priorities and thats why you need a new senator like Patrick Murphy.n" I have to say nobody should want to wake up on November 9th and wonder whether there was more you could have done, 1663, 1731
I hope you will wake up on November 9th proud that you took a stand and voted for an America that belongs to all of us where we set big goals and we work together to achieve them.n I got to tell you I believe America is great because America is good.n "And I want to tell you one other thing, 1731, 1792
I want to say one other thing thats really very important to me, 1792, 1805
We should honor the men and women in uniform who fight for our country.n" Thats why I was so appalled when Donald Trump tweeted that the new effort underway to push the terrorists out of the key city of Mosul is already and I quote him "a total disaster" and that our country is again a quote "looking dumb." Really? Hes declaring defeat before the battle has even started, 1805, 1874
Hes proving once again he is unqualified to be commander in chief of our military.n Heres another example, 1874, 1892
He was asked if he would defend our allies, 1892, 1901
He said well first hed want to know if they made any payments to us to defend them, 1901, 1919
And when asked specifically about Israel he said and I quote again he would "love to be neutral."n "Now we cant have a president who says hes neutral on Monday pro-Israel on Tuesday and who knows what on Wednesday because in his mind everything is negotiable.n" I have a different view, 1919, 1970
We stand with our allies, 1970, 1975
We stand with those who will help us defeat terrorism.n "So I -- I get pretty excited about what we could to together, 1975, 1998
And with your help were going to make the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II -- jobs in infra-structure and advanced manufacturing and clean renewable energy and small busi-nesses, 1998, 2030
I want us to make America the clean energy super power of the 21st century.n" "We can create millions of jobs and protect our planet at the same time, 2030, 2059
And Ive got to say no state no state should care more about this issue than Florida, 2059, 2076
Right? And you know Ill tell you something that its kind of sad to be honest with you, 2076, 2094
Ive traveled all over the country, 2094, 2100
And in New Jersey and Massachusetts they have more solar power than the Sunshine State.n" "Why? Well because you have a governor and a legislature who like your current senator doesnt want to believe the science of climate change; doesnt see the opportunity that Florida has to be literally the global leader in clean energy.n" And so I want to deploy a half-billion more solar panels by the end of my first term and enough clean energy to power every home in America within 10 years.n "And were also going to strengthen education at every level starting with universal pre-K and working -- working with our teachers to make sure every child has a good school with good teachers in every zip code, 2100, 2223
And heres what I want all the students to hear were going to make college more affordable for everyone.n" You know after our primary which was hard-fought and I was proud of the primary we ran because it was about issues, 2223, 2264
Senator Sanders and I got together came up with a plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for any families making less than $125000 a year.n "Thats the vast majority of families, 2264, 2297
And if youre over that were going to make it debt-free, 2297, 2308
So pay what you can afford, 2308, 2314
But I dont want to see young people and their families going into debt, 2314, 2328
I view this as an investment, 2328, 2334
And thats why were going to make it easier for you to afford to pay back your college debt -- pay it down and pay it off.n" "And I also want more pathways to good jobs that dont require a four-year college de-gree, 2334, 2377
Lets return technical education to high schools, 2377, 2384
Lets do more with our community colleges, 2384, 2391
Lets have more apprenticeship programs so that everybody has a chance at a good job.n" "And you know in addition -- in addition to making the economy grow and making sure people are ready with the skills to do these jobs I want to make it fairer, 2391, 2438
Thats why I want to raise the national minimum wage, 2438, 2448
If you work full-time you shouldnt still be in poverty, 2448, 2458
And dont you think it is finally maybe past time to guarantee equal pay for womens work?n" "And you know I always tell crowds this is not a womens issue, 2458, 2488
Its a family issue, 2488, 2492
If you have a wife a mother a sister or a daughter working its your issue, 2492, 2508
And thats why we have got to get this fixed once and for all.n" "And lets make childcare affordable, 2508, 2527
And lets have more profit sharing, 2527, 2533
And lets do the kinds of things that will lift everybody up, 2533, 2545
Now you know when I talk about raising equal pay for women as one of my primary issues you know Donald Trump or somebody always says well there she goes playing the woman card, 2545, 2579
And Ive got to tell you I dont believe thats what it is, 2579, 2592
I think were paying -- playing the smart card.n" "Because we want everybodys incomes to go up, 2592, 2609
Thats how were going to get this economy really moving forward creating new jobs, 2609, 2623
And so if thats playing the woman card you know what we say deal me in.n" "Ive also said I will pledge not to do anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $250000 a year because we dont need to do that, 2623, 2668
We can go where the money is the millionaires and the billionaires the corporations to make them pay their fair share to support the kind of growth that we need in our economy.n" "Were going to close the loopholes and make sure no multi- millionaire can get away with paying a lower rate than a nurse or a police officer or a teacher.n" "Now remember when we learned in one of the debates that Donald Trump hadnt paid any federal taxes?n" "For about 20 years is the best guess weve got and his excuse I love his excuse his excuse was well he lost $1 billion in a year.n" "Ive been really pondering this, 2668, 2782
How does anybody lose $1 billion in a year especially when youre running casinos? Think about it, 2782, 2799
Has anybody here ever been to a casino?n"  Yes!n " Well you know usually they say the house wins so Donald Trump said it was smart for him to avoid paying taxes, 2799, 2831
Well if losing $1 billion is smart I think thats kind of upside down and backwards, 2831, 2847
I think people should be working hard to make their incomes to support their families and thats what were going to do because we dont want the kind of values that Donald Trump used in running his business to be in our government.n" "He stiffs -- he stiffs small businesses, 2847, 2897
My dad was a small business owner, 2897, 2904
Donald Trump has refused to pay all kinds of folks workers small businesses installing drapes or marble or glass or where he bought pianos he didnt pay them, 2904, 2932
He just doesnt pay them and he gets away with it because he turns and he says to these small businesses well go ahead and sue me.n" "Well my dad because he was a small business man I know he could never have afforded that so Im just glad he never got a contract from Donald Trump because our family would have been hurt by that.n" "So heres the bottom line and heres what I need you to do, 2932, 3011
We have got to get everybody you know to turn out and vote and you have early voting now and its going to be much easier for some of you to vote early, 3011, 3044
And if you believe in any of the issues that we have talked about in this campaign if you believe that women and girls should be treated with respect if you believe that marriage equality should be protected.n" "If you believe -- if believe in science and believe we should take action if you believe America belongs to everybody willing to work for it and we should stand up against any kind of negative tax then I hope you will come out and vote because its going to be a close election, 3044, 3136
Pay no attention to the polls, 3136, 3142
Dont get -- dont get complacent because weve got to turn people out.n" "So Im asking you to vote for me Im asking you to send Patrick Murphy to the Senate Im asking you most importantly to vote for yourselves because really thats what is at stake, 3142, 3189
So early voting began here in south Florida yesterday, 3189, 3198
It goes through Sunday November 6th, 3198, 3204
You can go to your early voting site in your county between 7 AM and 7 PM, 3204, 3221
In fact you can go across the street right now to the North Regional Library and cast your ballot today.n" "And we have volunteers and staff ready to escort you so hey go ahead and vote now, 3221, 3258
And you can go to iwillvote.com to confirm your polling place and make sure you have a plan to vote, 3258, 3278
But dont stop there, 3278, 3282
If you will join us in these next two weeks every phone call you make every door you knock on will make a difference, 3282, 3306
So please go to HillaryClinton.com sign up to volunteer take out your phone text JOIN to 47246 and get involved because the bigger the turnout the bigger statement we will make about the kind of country we are and the future we want to build together.n" Now let me just end by saying that people ask me all the time you know what moti-vates you how do you do this day after day? And you know look I love this country and I feel blessed, 3306, 3391
I feel blessed and I want everybody to have the same chance to go after your part of the American Dream and I think the American Dream is big enough for everybody.n "I think a lot about my two grandchildren because obviously I would do anything to help them but its not just them, 3391, 3445
I want to help everybodys children and grandchildren because the kind of country we will have when they become adults will be affected by the decisions we make now on education on healthcare on ending the epidemic of gun violence on getting the cost of prescription drugs down on preserving and protecting Social Security and Medicare doing what we must to make sure were passing on a country that provides the same level of opportunity to all who come after us.n" "So please join me, 3445, 3530
This is bigger than me its bigger than any of us, 3530, 3541
Its even bigger than Donald Trump if you can believe it.n" "This is a crossroads election thats going to determine so much about what kind of country we have in the decades ahead, 3541, 3574
I want to wake up in the White House with your help making it my mission to do everything I can to give every person and particularly every child the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential.n" "If you will stand with me if you will work with me over the next two weeks lets go out and build the kind of future we want for ourselves for our kids and lets prove once and for all that love trumps hate.n" Thank you all very much, 3574, 3663
