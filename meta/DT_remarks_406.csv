Remember this a big big victory for the factory worker, 125, 135
They havent had those victories for a long time, 135, 144
A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many many years, 144, 165

I just got back from a tour of the suffering and devastation in Louisiana, 221, 235
Perhaps you can tell by the way Im dressed, 235, 244
Just got off the plane, 244, 249
It was actually incredible, 249, 253
The spirit of the people is incredible, 253, 260
The devastation likewise theyve never seen anything like it but the spirit of the people is incredible, 260, 277
And honestly Obama ought to get off the golf course and get down there, 277, 291
" n We mourn for the lives lost and we pledge our help comfort and support to every last person in need, 291, 313
To the people of Louisiana we are with you and we will always be with you, 313, 329
 n "In my vision I saw not only the suffering of our people but also their strength courage and really unbeatable spirit, 329, 351
Their spirit will overcome, 351, 355
We have a lot to overcome in our country especially the fact that our jobs are being taken away from us and going to other lands and were not going to allow it to happen and especially its happening right here in Michigan, 355, 398
" n "Its an amazing spirit that we will need to rebuild our country, 398, 412
Its that strength that were going to need to create the new American future our children so much deserve, 412, 431
" n "In this new -- thank you, 431, 439
Thank you very much, 439, 443
In this new future millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the work force, 443, 460
And if Im not elected president that will never happen believe me, 460, 472
Theyre talking to you theyre playing you but believe me you know the answer.n" "And I have to say that Ive been talking about Michigan and the car industry and how your businesses and plants have been ripped out of your land and I have been doing it for four years to the people of Michigan, 472, 528
Other people started talking about it last week, 528, 536
Theyre not going to do anything about it.n" Crumbling roads bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves, 536, 560

Children stuck in failing government schools will be able to attend the school of their choice, 572, 588

We will build the wall, 623, 628
" n Law and order will be restored and the poorest places in our country will know safety and peace again, 628, 649
 n American values and cultures will be cherished - and I mean cherished and celebrated once again, 649, 666
But to achieve this new American future we must break free from the bitter failures of the past and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies over and over and over again, 666, 701
 n "No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clintons policies than African-Americans no group, 701, 718
No group, 718, 720
If Hillary Clintons goal was to inflict pain on the African-American community she could not have done a better job, 720, 740
It is a disgrace, 740, 744
" n "Tonight Im asking for the vote of every single African-American citizen in this country who wants to see a better future, 744, 767
" n "The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic party for more than 50 years, 767, 787
Their policies have produced only poverty joblessness failing schools and broken homes, 787, 799
Its time to hold democratic politicians accountable for what they have done to these communities, 799, 814
At what point do we say enough? " n At what point do we say enough?  n "It is time to hold failed leaders accountable for their results not just their empty words over and over again, 814, 851
Look at what the democratic party has done to the city as an example and there are many others of Detroit, 851, 872
40 percent of Detroits residents 40 percent live in poverty, 872, 882
Half of all Detroit residents do not work and cannot work and cant get a jobn" Detroit tops the list of most dangerous cities in terms of violent crime number one, 882, 913
This is the legacy of the democratic politicians who have run this city, 913, 926
This is the result of the policy agenda embraced by crooked Hillary Clinton, 926, 939
 n 33000 e-mails gone, 939, 943
 n The only way to change results is to change leadership, 943, 954
 n We can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created our problems in the first place, 954, 975
A new future requires brand new leadership, 975, 982
 n Look at how much African-American communities are suffering from democratic control, 982, 994
To those I say the following what do you have to lose by trying something new like Trump? What do you have to lose?  n "I say it again what do you have to lose? Look youre living in poverty, 994, 1034
Your schools are no good, 1034, 1039
You have no jobs, 1039, 1043
58% of your youth is unemployed, 1043, 1049
What the hell do you have to lose?n" "And at the end of four years I guarantee you that I will get over 95% of the African American vote, 1049, 1078
I promise you, 1078, 1081
Because I will produce I will produce for the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans, 1081, 1100
And the Democrats will not produce and all they have done is taken advantage of your vote, 1100, 1117
Thats all theyve done, 1117, 1121
And once the election is over they go back to their palaces in Washington, 1121, 1135
And you know what? They do nothing for you, 1135, 1144
Just remember it.n" So you have nothing to lose, 1144, 1153
One thing we know for sure: if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same exactly the same results.n My administration will go to work for you as no one has ever done before.n We will work, 1153, 1195
We will bring back jobs, 1195, 1200
We will work.n "By contrast the one thing every item in Hillary Clintons agenda has in common is that it takes jobs and opportunities away from African American workers.n" "It takes jobs away from all workers because your companies are leaving Michigan, 1200, 1242
Your companies are leaving every single state in our union, 1242, 1252
Theyre going to Mexico, 1252, 1256
Theyre going everywhere but here.n" Hillary Clinton supports open borders, 1256, 1266
Which means many things but it means people pouring and they take your jobs.n "Whether you like it or dont like it, 1266, 1288
They take your jobs.n" Her fierce opposition to school choice, 1288, 1298
You need choice, 1298, 1301
You have to get your children into good schools, 1301, 1310
You do that through competition, 1310, 1315
You need choice.n Her plan to massively raise taxes on small business and everyone, 1315, 1329
$1.3 trillion tax increase, 1329, 1333
Where as I am cutting taxes very substantively for business and for the middle class.n Her tremendous opposition to American energy, 1333, 1354
Her opposition is fierce and her record of giving our jobs away to many many other countries, 1354, 1371
America must reject the bigot dream of Hillary Clinton who sees communities of color only as votes not as human beings worthy of a better future.n Hillary Clinton would rather provide a job to a refugee from overseas that to give that job to unemployed African American youth in cities like Detroit who have become refugees in their own country.n "Its time to get our country back to work and that includes an all out effort, 1371, 1447
To help young African Americans get the good paying jobs that they deserve.n" "Hillary Clintons plan would bring in an estimated 620000 refugees in her first term at a lifetime benefit cost of some $400 billion to our country, 1447, 1486
According to the Senate Immigration Subcommittee.n" "Hillary Clinton wants to be Americas Angela Merkel, 1486, 1500
By the way for the price of supporting one refugee in the United States we could support 12 in a safe zone in the Middle East or lets say Syria.n" "The approved refugee screening standards that I have proposed will save countless billions of dollars, 1500, 1545
Its called extreme vetting, 1545, 1549
Extreme vetting, 1549, 1551
" n We will invest a portion of the money saved in the jobs program for inner city youth, 1551, 1570
The African American community has given so much to this country, 1570, 1581
They fought and died in every war since the Revolution.n "Theyve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the long march towards civil rights, 1581, 1606
Theyve sacrificed so much for the national good, 1606, 1614
Yet nearly 4 in 10 African Americans children still live in poverty and 58% as I said of African Americans are not working.n" They cannot find a job.n "We must do better as a country, 1614, 1649
I refuse to believe that the future must be like the past, 1649, 1661
It wont be, 1661, 1664
Our future will be a great future for everyone, 1664, 1673
For everyone, 1673, 1675
" n In a Trump administration all workers of all colors will get priorities for jobs in their own country which is about time.n I want higher wages for African Americans for Hispanic Americans and for all Americans, 1675, 1713
We want higher wages  n Many many workers in our country are making substantially less money today in real wages than they made 18 years ago.n "Theyre working two jobs instead of one, 1713, 1746
Theyre working much harder as they get older and its supposed to be the opposite.n" "Were gonna stop it, 1746, 1765
Were going to create great jobs and were gonna get the wages up.n" Hillary Clinton is a throwback to an ugly past where politicians preyed on our poorest citizens while selling them out for personal gain, 1765, 1801
Promises promises all talk no action, 1801, 1807
All talk no action politicians.n They talk talk talk, 1807, 1816
You vote them in with great fan fare and then they just do nothing.n With Trump that is not going to happen, 1816, 1838
Believe me.n "We must turn the page on yesterday only a change in leadership will produce a change in outcomes, 1838, 1858
And we cant take as a country four more years of Obama, 1858, 1870
And thats what you get with Hillary Clinton but probably worse.n" In this new American future American workers will always come first, 1870, 1892
America first always come first.n This will include a complete revitalization of the Michigan manufacturing sector, 1892, 1908
Now you have to understand the Michigan manufacturing sector is a disaster, 1908, 1920
Is a disaster.n "Look at your notes look at your stats look at whats happening to your state, 1920, 1938
Youre losing your businesses, 1938, 1942
Its like taking candy away from a baby, 1942, 1950
And many people right now in this audience that think you have jobs youre gonna find out very soon that your company is leaving from Mexico or some other place and youre not going to have your job for very long.n" "And if Trump gets in those days are over folks theyre over " n We will be brining back our jobs to Michigan, 1950, 2014
There will be a very big price to pay for those companies that wanna leave our land go someplace else manufacture their goods and sell back with no retribution.n "It wont happen, 2014, 2046
There will be consequence, 2046, 2050
Wont happen, 2050, 2052
It will not happen.n" Michigan lost more than 1 in 4 of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.n As you know NAFTA one of the worst trade bills in history maybe maybe the worst trade bill signed in the history of the world, 2052, 2094
Not only in our country, 2094, 2099
Its emptied out Michigan its emptied out New England, 2099, 2108
Its emptied out New York State, 2108, 2114
Its emptied out so many of our great companies.n They leave and they fire, 2114, 2128
We end up with devastation, 2128, 2133
We end up with unemployment, 2133, 2138
We end up with nothing.n The bill was signed by Bill Clinton, 2138, 2150
 n It was supported by Hillary Clinton, 2150, 2157
 n Right here in this community you have lost 1 in 7 manufacturing jobs since Bill Clinton put China into the World Trade Organization, 2157, 2181
Another Hillary Clinton back deal, 2181, 2186
She backs all the deals.n "And by the way she will be backing Trans Pacific Partnership, 2186, 2202
TPP, 2202, 2203
If she is elected, 2203, 2207
Just mark your words, 2207, 2211
Just remember you know its gonna happen.n" She considered it the gold standard, 2211, 2224
All of a sudden when she heard me talking about it she said "I cant win this one" so she went against it, 2224, 2247
She will go back immediately and you saw that when the governor of Virginia whos her friend said that was going to happen.n Detroit lost more than 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs following the NAFTA and WTO agreements, 2247, 2285
That was supported very strongly by my opponent.n "No industry has been hurt more by Hillary Clintons policies than the automobile industry or as we call it the car industry, 2285, 2315
It has been a total disaster.n" According to the Bureau of the Labor of Statistics before NAFTA went into effect there were 285000 auto workers in Michigan, 2315, 2342
Today that number is down to only 160000 and it is going to be a lot lower because if you look at the massive plants being built right now in Mexico car plants folks you can kiss these jobs goodbye, 2342, 2382
 n "But not me, 2382, 2386
Not with me, 2386, 2389
It wont happen, 2389, 2392
" n In 2014 General Motors announced plans to double its investments in Mexico by plans by 2018, 2392, 2410
Not good, 2410, 2412
 n "In April 2016 Ford Motor Company announced plans to invest another $1.6 billion constructing an auto plant in Mexico, 2412, 2432
Mexico will become the car capital of the world very very quickly, 2432, 2444
And Michigan is going to end up with lots of empty buildings all over the place unless you elect Donald Trump president, 2444, 2466
In which case its not gonna happen, 2466, 2473
" n In same month Fiat Chrysler announced 1300 layoffs, 2473, 2483
The list goes on and on, 2483, 2489
We will turn it around we will turn it around fast, 2489, 2500
We will meet with these companies and we will say it will not be easy for you to move your plant to Mexico for you sell your cars through what will be a very strong border and for you not to pay tax on those cars coming in okay?  n "And when we tell them that there will be a substantial tax on the cars that they make in Mexico and other places number one theyre not going to move in the first place and number two if they do our country will make one heck of a lot of money, 2500, 2601
" n "But to save your jobs and do all of the things that Im talking about we have to win on November 8th, 2601, 2625
" n The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Transpacific Partnership is approved, 2625, 2642
It will be almost nothing is as bad as NAFTA but it will be almost as bad as NAFTA.n "We know from Hillarys closest friend that she is planning to ram through TPP if shes elected, 2642, 2678
She even called it as I said the gold standard, 2678, 2688
Its passage would be a disaster for Michigan in particular for the car industry in particular for the people of Michigan, 2688, 2709
I wont let it happen, 2709, 2714
" n According to the Economic Policy Institute the United States trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over one million manufacturing jobs in our country in 2015, 2714, 2744
By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parks which lost nearly 740000 think of that 740000 manufacturing jobs, 2744, 2765
Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to trade deficit with TPP members.n "Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if Hillary gets her wish and approves TPP, 2765, 2802
It will not be pretty, 2802, 2807
Thats why I have announced that we will withdrawal from the deal before that deal can ever ever ever happen, 2807, 2827
" n I have have previously laid out a detailed seven-point plan for trade reform available on my website, 2827, 2846
It includes strong protections against currency manipulation from countries like China and tariffs against any nation that cheats by unfairly subsidizing their goods of which many of them do, 2846, 2875
 n My plan also includes a total renegotiation of NAFTA so our jobs can come back, 2875, 2891
 n "And if we cant make a much much better deal than we have right now we will walk, 2891, 2910
" n "Im not in any way shape or form an isolationist, 2910, 2922
I dont believe in it but we have to make great deals for our country, 2922, 2937
Were losing in our whole trade negotiation with all countries over $800 billion a year, 2937, 2952
Thats our trade deficit, 2952, 2956
Who negotiates these deals? We want great trade deals and we will have them, 2956, 2970
" n But we want trade deals that work for America that create jobs and wealth for our country that work for the American worker, 2970, 2995
 n "We want to shrink our almost $800 billion trade deficit, 2995, 3006
We dont want to expand it and its been expanding for years, 3006, 3018
For years and years, 3018, 3022
You look at the charts up up up up up, 3022, 3032
And I say to myself so often why dont they do something about it? And the reason is we have political hacks as our negotiators.n" "We have politicians as our negotiators, 3032, 3063
We have politicians that are controlled like Hillary Clinton by her donors her special interests and her lobbyists and they wont let her do whats right for our workers and for our country.n" We want to be leading the world in production exports and manufacturing, 3063, 3108
We want jobs to leave from other countries and come into our country for a change, 3108, 3124
 n Another major issue in this race is foreign policy, 3124, 3134
Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another, 3134, 3145
Beginning with the support for going to war in Iraq and I opposed it so strongly.n Nobody cared, 3145, 3163
I was a civilian but I opposed it, 3163, 3171
I said you will have a total destabilization of the Middle East, 3171, 3183
It was such common sense and look what happened, 3183, 3192
Her tenure as secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in United States history, 3192, 3209
But she is totally without remorse, 3209, 3215
Her failed decisions as secretary of State unleashed ISIS onto the world, 3215, 3227
 n But has she ever apologized for the death and destruction she has caused? No.n Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State, 3227, 3254
Pre-Hillary in the early 2009s Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, 3254, 3266
Libya was somewhat stable, 3266, 3270
Syria was under control, 3270, 3274
The group we now know today ISIS was close to being extinguished, 3274, 3286
Iran was being choked by sanctions.n Now take a look at what we have, 3286, 3300
Fast forward to the present time.n "After Hillary here is what it looks like, 3300, 3314
Iraq is in total chaos, 3314, 3319
Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war, 3319, 3329
A refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States where were taking in thousands and thousands and thousands of people, 3329, 3350
ISIS has been unleashed unto the entire world.n" "Iran the worlds top state sponsor of terrorism has been put on the path to nuclear weapons was given $400 million in ransom payment cash " n Very much like you can keep your doctor you can keep your plan Obamacare a total disaster, 3350, 3402
It will be repealed, 3402, 3406
It will be replaced, 3406, 3410
 n Hillary Clinton is a legacy of death destruction and terrorism, 3410, 3421
America deserves a better legacy.n All of you deserve a much much better future.n I am the change agent, 3421, 3440
I am the change agent, 3440, 3445
 n "I am your messenger, 3445, 3450
And I said it many times Im nothing more than your messenger, 3450, 3462
Its a message of strong defense common sense take care of our vets great education get rid of Common Core great health care get rid of Obamacare save our Second Amendment, 3462, 3493
" n Which is under tremendous siege right now.n Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo or what we have, 3493, 3515
While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton she cashed in big time, 3515, 3528
Our country was losing, 3528, 3532
Our people were losing but she is cashing in.n "Bill Clintons speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State, 3532, 3552
He was paid almost $50 million for speeches during her tenure an increase in 44 percent over the previous four years.n" By the way things came out today that blow everything away today, 3552, 3585
Then there was all of the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations, 3585, 3602
It was pay for play, 3602, 3607
 n Yet Hillary Clinton who is indifferent to the suffering she has caused has no remorse at all, 3607, 3625
She offers no apologies, 3625, 3629
No apologies for unleashing ISIS, 3629, 3634
No apologies for her open borders, 3634, 3640
No apologies for lying about her e-mails or about Benghazi, 3640, 3650
 n The only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33000 e-mails that she deleted.n And the only way to get justice in this rigged system is to show up and vote on November 8th and vote big big big, 3650, 3697
 n And I will bring your jobs back, 3697, 3705
So are you ready to vote?n And what about your future? Is it going to be great good or terrible?n "Great, 3705, 3726
So if youre ready to vote for honest government and the honest government that you deserve a Trump administration will end the corruption and restore integrity to government service, 3726, 3755
Remember Im funding my campaign Im spending tremendous amounts of money on running for office.n" "Im raising money for the Republican Party and the Republican National Committee which I think is doing a very good job but Ill tell you more about that on November 8th, 3755, 3801
Ill let you know if they do a good job or if they do not such a good job, 3801, 3820
But I think theyre going to do a great job.n" "No one will be above the law in a Trump administration, 3820, 3841
The State Department will work for the country not for Hillary Clintons donors, 3841, 3854
" n And I will work for you and I will work for no one else, 3854, 3870
I will work for you, 3870, 3875
I will never lie to you, 3875, 3881
I will never put any other interests before you and I will never ever stop fighting for you, 3881, 3899
Never, 3899, 3900
 n "The government will work for the people again, 3900, 3909
That means we are only going to admit individuals into our country who support our values and were not going to issue visas where adequate screening controls take place, 3909, 3938
We are going to make sure that we have total screening and without it we cannot continue to have our government run like this, 3938, 3962
We will also seek to join in partnership with any nation that wishes to join us in defeating and destroying ISIS, 3962, 3983
" n "At home taxes will go down especially for look I mean its going to go down for a lot of people for business theyre going down businesses are going to flourish theyre going to come pouring back, 3983, 4022
But taxes will go down especially for middle-income Americans, 4022, 4031
" n And small business rates will be lowered to 15 percent so we can put millions of new jobs into our poorest neighborhoods, 4031, 4055
 n "As I said Obamacare will be repealed and replaced, 4055, 4065
Voters not special interests will be in charge finally, 4065, 4074
We are going to bring our country together again, 4074, 4083
We have a divided country, 4083, 4088
Its totally divided, 4088, 4091
The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity total unity, 4091, 4105
We will love each other, 4105, 4110
We will have one county, 4110, 4115
Everybody will work together, 4115, 4119
" n "We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans, 4119, 4137
