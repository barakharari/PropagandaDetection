It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for ten months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination, 0, 35
Senator Cruz has done very poorly and after his New York performance which was a total disaster he is in free fall and as everyone has seen he does not react well under pressure, 35, 69
Also approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him, 69, 79
Governor Kasich who has only won 1 state out of 41 in other words he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so, 79, 125
Marco Rubio as an example has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago, 125, 143
Others likewise have done much better than Kasich who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin, 143, 165
85% of Republican voters are against Kasich, 165, 172
Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive, 172, 197
They are mathematically dead and this act only shows as puppets of donors and special interests how truly weak they and their campaigns are, 197, 221
I have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich, 221, 244
Additionally I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me, 244, 278
Because of me everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged, 278, 292
When two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system, 292, 345
This horrible act of desperation from two campaigns who have totally failed makes me even more determined for the good of the Republican Party and our country to prevail! , 345, 374
