"The stakes couldnt be higher." "On January 20 2017 America will begin our next chapter, 0, 15
A new president will stand on the steps of the Capitol raise one hand and take the oath of office, 15, 35
From that moment on he or she will decide whether we defend and build on the progress weve made under President Obama—or tear it all away." That feels pretty personal to me—not just as an American who supports President Obama but also as someone who was proud to work alongside him at the White House, 35, 90
I remember vividly the day after the 2008 election when President-elect Obama asked me to come see him in Chicago, 90, 110
It turned out that he would ask me to be secretary of state, 110, 123
But first we talked about everything he was doing to get ready for his first term—and everything he was learning about the reality of the economic crisis our country was facing, 123, 154
The president-elect was getting briefings every day sometimes several times a day, 154, 166
And the news was not good, 166, 172
He turned to me and said "It is so much worse than they told us." He was right, 172, 190
"By the time President Obama was sworn into office we were on the brink of another Great Depression, 190, 208
Before the worst was over we were losing 800000 jobs a month 5 million Americans lost their homes and 13 trillion dollars of family wealth was wiped away, 208, 236
Meanwhile our auto industry—the pride of American manufacturing and ingenuity for decades—was on the verge of collapse, 236, 253
It turned out to be the second-worst financial crisis in our countrys history." "President Obama changed all that, 253, 271
Look where we are today, 271, 276
Weve had 70 straight months of private-sector job growth, 276, 285
Our businesses have created 14.1 million jobs, 285, 292
The unemployment rate is the lowest in seven years, 292, 301
And the auto industry just had its best year " , 301, 311
"Thats a pretty outstanding record for any president—let alone one who took office amid an economic disaster, 311, 328
?Thats not all, 328, 331
Weve imposed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s, 331, 342
We created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau just over a year ago—and its already returned nearly $11 billion to consumers." "Weve restored our standing around the world, 342, 369
Under President Obamas leadership we worked with Congress and the United Nations to impose crippling sanctions against Iran which paved the way for a landmark deal that will keep Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, 369, 404
We stood up for LGBT rights and womens rights around the world, 404, 416
We brought Osama bin Laden to justice, 416, 423
And thanks to a lot of painstaking diplomacy by the president and his team nearly 200 countries have signed on to a landmark agreement to tackle the urgent threat of climate change." "Then theres the progress weve made toward a cause close to my heart: putting quality affordable health care within reach for everyone, 423, 477
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act 18 million Americans now have health coverage, 477, 490
Millions more are receiving benefits like free preventive care, 490, 499
Americans can sleep easier knowing theyll never be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, 499, 514
Democrats have been trying to pass universal health care since Harry Trumans administration, 514, 527
President Obama got it done, 527, 532
Now we need to build on it bring down out-of-pocket costs and make sure every American can get the care they deserve." If you take a step back and look at all America has achieved over the past eight years its remarkable to see how far weve come, 532, 580
But youd never know it from listening to the Republicans, 580, 590
Theyre quick to demonize and demean President Obama, 590, 598
At the last GOP presidential debate two candidates referred to him as a "child." That kind of racially coded rhetoric has no place in our politics, 598, 624
Instead of insulting our president we should be thanking him, 624, 634
? "Republicans arent just harshly criticizing the president, 634, 642
Theyre threatening to undo just about everything he has achieved, 642, 652
They want to repeal the Affordable Care Act; in fact theyve voted to repeal or dismantle it more than 50 times, 652, 673
Theyre hard at work dismantling workers rights and voting rights, 673, 683
They want to take away womens rights to make our own health decisions, 683, 696
Some even want to reverse marriage equality—one of the greatest civil rights accomplishments in American history." "In short they want to drag us backward and undo all the progress weve worked so hard to achieve, 696, 731
We cant let that happen." "As president I will carry forward the Democratic record of achievement, 731, 747
Ill defend President Obamas accomplishments and build upon them, 747, 756
Ill work to get incomes rising for middle-class families make college affordable alleviate the crushing burden of student debt protect LGBT Americans from discrimination preserve womens access to health care and reproductive choice and keep America safe from threats at home and abroad, 756, 799
And Ill never allow the Affordable Care Act to be repealed." "?Weve made tremendous progress over the past eight years, 799, 819
That shouldnt be dismissed or taken lightly, 819, 826
Lets keep that progress going, 826, 831
Lets make sure no one turns the clock back, 831, 840
Weve come too far, 840, 844
Weve accomplished too much, 844, 848
We can do even more for our families our communities and the country we love, 848, 863
And together we can build an economy and a country that works for everyone, 863, 877
That would be truly revolutionary." , 877, 882
