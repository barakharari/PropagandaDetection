"Its so great to be back in Ohio." Come November we are going to win this state we are going to win the White House – and we are going to bring back your jobs, 0, 35
We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first, 35, 48
We are going to stop the product dumping the unfair foreign subsidies and the currency manipulation, 48, 64
We are going to stop the foreign cheating, 64, 72
The era of economic surrender is over, 72, 79
A new era of American Greatness is beginning, 79, 87
No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio, 87, 101
"Hillary Clinton backed her husbands NAFTA she backed Chinas entrance into the World Trade Organization she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership." One bad deal after another, 101, 135
"Hillary Clintons donors own her and she will do whatever they tell her to do." Ohio has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA and nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization, 135, 175
Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars, 175, 189
This subtracts directly from our growth – our economy grew only 1.1 percent in the last quarter a total disaster, 189, 209
This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton, 209, 216
I am promising a new legacy for America, 216, 224
We are going to create a New American Future, 224, 233
But to do that we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 233, 244
Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100000 manufacturing jobs last year, 244, 265
Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved, 265, 278
Hillary Clinton who called the TPP the "Gold Standard" would 100% approve it if she ever got in, 278, 296
"We wont let that happen." We will win this election and we will keep America out of the TPP, 296, 315
We will defend our freedom our jobs and our economic independence, 315, 326
"Its going to be America First." My economic plan is going to grow this economy raise your wages and create millions of new jobs, 326, 350
Here are a few of the things we will do: A massive tax cut for working Americans, 350, 367
"We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administrations new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent." Hillary Clinton says she wants to "put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business." Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business, 367, 430
We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work – and we are going to get your energy bills down, 430, 455
We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade, 455, 472
We are going to create jobs for all of our people and we are going to fight to ensure that every young African-American and Latino child is put on the ladder of American success: a good education and a great job, 472, 513
Another major part of our agenda is immigration security, 513, 522
We need to protect American jobs, 522, 528
We need to protect American safety, 528, 534
Last night I outlined a detailed plan to provide jobs safety and security to the American people with bold new immigration reforms, 534, 556
I had a great meeting yesterday with the President of Mexico where we both expressed our shared desire to secure the border put the cartels out of business and to keep jobs in our hemisphere, 556, 591
"Lets also talk about government corruption." No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State, 591, 614
Here is one example of Clinton Corruption, 614, 621
"As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One giving up control of about 20 percent of Americas uranium supply to the Russians, 621, 659
Clintons approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars, 659, 674
In exchange for signing off on the deal some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations, 674, 699
In addition Bill Clinton received $500000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal." Here is another example of pay-for-play, 699, 726
In 2009 Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S, 726, 733
pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments – including Sudan Syria and Iran, 733, 748
Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people, 748, 761
"In June 2011 Hillary Clintons state department began adding goods and service to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism." During that time Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton paying him $750000 – his highest paying speech, 761, 809
"In April 2012 the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria –but those sanctions did not cover Ericssons work in Iran." A Trump Administration will end the government corruption, 809, 846
No one will be above the law, 846, 853
"We will have one set of rules for everyone, 853, 862
In Hillary Clintons world we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else." "I am fighting for everyone who doesnt have a voice, 862, 893
The forgotten men and women of America." I am your voice, 893, 904
"Hillary Clintons campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers." My campaign is powered by my own money but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back, 904, 941
Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5 10 or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters, 941, 978
Come November 8th we are once again going to have a government that serves you your family and your country, 978, 998
We are going to rebuild our depleted military avoid needless foreign wars build new friendships overseas and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength, 998, 1023
We are going to work with our allies to crush defeat and utterly destroy ISIS, 1023, 1038
"We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who dont support our tolerant values." My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses, 1038, 1076
My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the prince of your energy bill, 1076, 1093
My trade reforms will raise wages grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country, 1093, 1110
My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visas programs that hurt poor workers, 1110, 1128
My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads bridges and airports, 1128, 1138
My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive and for young children to live out their dreams, 1138, 1160
My promise of school choice charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities, 1160, 1179
Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice, 1179, 1190
My government reforms will make your voice heard – not the voice of the special interests, 1190, 1206
Every insider getting rich off of our broken system is throwing money at Hillary Clinton, 1206, 1221
"Its the powerful protecting the powerful." Insiders fighting for insiders, 1221, 1231
I am fighting for you, 1231, 1236
Every day you turn on the nightly news you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign, 1236, 1260
Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign, 1260, 1270
Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign, 1270, 1280
"I wear their opposition as a badge of honor, 1280, 1289
Because it means I am fighting for REAL change not just partisan change, 1289, 1302
I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country, 1302, 1323
The media-donor-political complex thats bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of by and for the people." I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally protected equally and honored equally, 1323, 1361
We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms and seek a new future of security prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people, 1361, 1398
I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House, 1398, 1414
"To every parent who dreams for their children and to every child who dreams for their future I say these words to you tonight: Im with you I will fight for you and I will win for you." Together We Will Make America Strong Again, 1414, 1459
We Will Make American Safe Again, 1459, 1465
And We Will Make America Great Again, 1465, 1472
Thank you and God Bless, 1472, 1477
