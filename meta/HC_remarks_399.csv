"Thank you! Thank you all so much, 0, 7
Wow! I am so happy to be back here in Iowa on a beautiful fall day to see all of you, 7, 28
And I especially want to thank Janelle for her intro-duction, 28, 38
And I so appreciate that Janelle and Nora and her husband Stu are here today, 38, 53
I remember so well when I met her back in 2015 and I saw that sign, 53, 69
And my best friend from sixth grade was also going through breast cancer and being treated, 69, 85
And when I saw Janelles sign it just made me think about my friend and I wanted to go over and meet this woman who had been through 13 chemo treatments already, 85, 117
And we just clicked, 117, 121
And I have been so grateful to be able to get to know her better and spend time with her when I see her, 121, 145
And I got to introduce her to my best friend when my best friend came to Iowa, 145, 162
So the circle is completed and more people are reaching out and finding ways to help each other, 162, 180
"Now before I came out I had the great great privilege of saying hello to someone Ruline Steininger who is – is Ruline still here? I know she was going to try to stay, 180, 214
There she is, 214, 217
Hello Ruline! Hello Ruline! Ruline is a 103-year-old resident of Pleasant Hill who was born in 1913, 217, 234
I am so grateful for her support and I dont know if any of you have seen the videos both about Janelle and about Ruline, 234, 259
But I really do recommend that you see them both, 259, 269
Ruline talks about this long active life that shes had and everything she has seen happen in America and the world, 269, 290
And I think its important to have that perspective, 290, 299
So its a great honor to have Ruline supporting me, 299, 309
I am so pleased, 309, 313
And shes going to go vote early today to make sure her vote counts." "I want to thank Dr, 313, 332
Andy McGuire for chairing the Iowa Democratic Party fighting so hard to elect Democrats, 332, 346
And I want to lift up and thank our Democratic Senate candidate Patty Judge, 346, 360
Wheres Patty? Pattys out there fighting hard every single day and she can use your help to make a strong case for her to go to the Senate, 360, 388
And Jim Mowrer the 3rd District congressional candidate, 388, 396
Jim is running a great campaign and we are really looking forward to having him in Washington, 396, 413
But that really depends upon everybody here and everybody across the great state of Iowa." "Now while were meeting on this beautiful day here in Des Moines I know our friends in Cedar Rapids and the region are once again facing the potential of flooding, 413, 458
I talked with the mayor, 458, 463
I talked with city council members and other leaders over the last day or so, 463, 478
They hope that they will not have the flooding, 478, 487
They took a lot of good precautionary measures, 487, 495
Our campaign along with thousands of people came out and helped to put the sandbags in to try to prevent flooding, 495, 516
And I told them that if Im so fortunate enough as to be president were going to have a big infrastructure program and were going to help prevent flooding in places like Cedar Rapids." "Now I also just want to say on a personal note I was terribly upset this morning to learn about a train crash in New Jersey, 516, 576
Thats very personal to me, 576, 581
I live in New York, 581, 586
People commute into New York from New Jersey, 586, 594
We had about a hundred commuters injured and one died, 594, 604
I just want to send our thoughts and prayers to them because its a horrible accident that ran into the depot and caused all kinds of damage, 604, 631
So I want to lift up the people of New Jersey and New York today." "Now we are starting to vote in Iowa today! And I saw my good friend Ruth Harkin and she told me she was the first person in line to vote today, 631, 677
And we have what 40 days 39 days left, 677, 686
And each and every one of you have the chance to make sure that we keep our country on the right path, 686, 708
We have 40 days to win an election thats going to affect the next 40 years of our country, 708, 727
And you every one of you can make the difference in this election." "Now how many of you participated in the caucuses? Well weve got a bunch of active Iowans here, 727, 758
Are you ready to go to the polls? Well luckily in Iowa you can start today, 758, 774
Lots of folks dont have that opportunity across the country, 774, 784
And a lot of our campaign volunteers are going to direct people right from this rally to early voting sites, 784, 804
Weve got one right down the street, 804, 811
So when you finish here you can go vote, 811, 820
And we can be on the path to victory here in Iowa." "Any of you see that debate on Monday night? Well one down two to go, 820, 847
Well I have to tell you it was an extraordinary experience because I did get to say a few things about the positive agenda that we want to have for our country because I want this election to be about something not just against somebody, 847, 892
And so I am going to close this campaign the way I started decades ago fighting for kids and families because its been the cause of my life, 892, 920
It will be the mission of my presidency because I know from my own experience that strong families are the base of a strong America, 920, 945
And I know from personal experience how important it is to give people the tools they need to make sure that they can go as far as their hard work their talent will take them." "Now you may have heard me say this, 945, 988
I started talking about this way back in the be-ginning of the campaign here in Iowa, 988, 1004
But I was very fortunate, 1004, 1009
None of us picks our parents, 1009, 1015
But I really was fortunate, 1015, 1020
My dad was a Navy veteran a small businessman and he worked hard every single day to build a good life to provide financial security a good solid middle class life, 1020, 1051
And I know how hard he worked because occasionally Id go down to his print plant where he printed fabrics for draperies, 1051, 1073
And it was not a very big building, 1073, 1081
It didnt have any natural life, 1081, 1087
There were no windows in it, 1087, 1093
Its what he could afford." "And there were two long tables, 1093, 1104
And hed roll out the fabric and then he would take a silkscreen, 1104, 1117
Any of you ever seen a silkscreen an old-fashioned silkscreen? Not far from here theres a wonderful t-shirt store, 1117, 1136
Right? And they still use silkscreens for some of their printing, 1136, 1147
So he would take that silkscreen and hed put it down and he would pour the paint in, 1147, 1165
Then hed take a squeegee and hed go across it, 1165, 1175
And then hed lift it up and hed go all the way down the table, 1175, 1190
And if there was going to be more than one color hed do it all over again, 1190, 1207
And then when he finished he would gather it up and put it in his car and hed go deliver it to the customer who had ordered it." "Thats how I was raised to think about doing business, 1207, 1245
You do your best, 1245, 1249
You enter into a contract or an agreement, 1249, 1257
Somebody orders your goods or your services, 1257, 1264
And then they pay you for it, 1264, 1271
Right? And as I said the other night one of the things that we have found out is that as his own campaign manager said about him Donald Trump has built a lot of businesses on the backs of the little guy, 1271, 1313
Her words, 1313, 1315
And I have met people who have been the victims of his refusal to honor contracts to pay what had been bargained for, 1315, 1338
I just am grateful that my dad never did business with him or somebody like him because we couldnt have survived all that." "All that work and then to be told were not going to pay you or maybe well pay you 10 cents on the dollar or 20 cents? Thats just wrong, 1338, 1391
What kind of person does that takes advantage of dishwashers and painters and architects and glass installers and so many people? Weve been looking into the records and theres a long list of people who have been mistreated, 1391, 1429
I just dont believe thats the way were supposed to treat each other in America, 1429, 1444
And that sure is not the way our president should be treating our citizens in our country." "Now my mom had a very different story, 1444, 1469
My dads father was a factory worker but they had a strong family, 1469, 1482
My mom was abandoned by her parents and then sent to live with grandparents and they didnt want her, 1482, 1501
So she was out on her own by the age of 14, 1501, 1513
She was working as a housemaid and a babysitter, 1513, 1522
And it may sound harsh but I will quickly tell you that it was the first time in her young life that she ever was in a family that showed love and respect for each other, 1522, 1558
So for her it was a gift." "And then she got another gift, 1558, 1571
The woman she worked for knew that my mom wanted to go to high school, 1571, 1586
And so the woman said If you can get up really early and you can get your chores done and get the little kids off to school you can go to high school, 1586, 1619
But youll have to come right back, 1619, 1626
That may sound harsh for a 14-year-old but for my mother it made all the difference, 1626, 1642
And thats exactly what she did for four years and most days she had to run – run – to get there, 1642, 1664
But she didnt care because she wanted to get an education." "So when I learned more about my moms life I knew that what I wanted to do was to stand up for kids and families and especially for kids whove been left out or left behind in some way, 1664, 1714
Thats why I went to work for the Childrens Defense Fund and learned quickly that kids with disabilities were not in our public schools back then and we worked to put together a coalition and convince Congress to pass the law and boy every day I am so thankful for your former Senator Tom Harkin who made the rights and opportunities of people with disabilities the centerpiece of his distinguished career." "So thats been my mission: How are we going to do more to help kids and families? And so when I talk about the economy – because I think we have three big issues facing us, 1714, 1821
Number one we need an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top right? We need to keep our country safe and we need to lead the world with strong and steady leadership in accordance with our values, 1821, 1862
And we need to bring our country together, 1862, 1870
We have to heal these divides." "But when I think about the economy yes I want more new good jobs with rising in-comes, 1870, 1893
I see my friends from the laborers here, 1893, 1901
We need to do work that builds our roads our bridges our ports our airports our tunnels our water systems our sewer systems, 1901, 1924
This is good honorable work and boy do we have a lot of it in America, 1924, 1940
We are living off the investments that our parents and our grandparents – and sometimes even great-grandparents – made, 1940, 1959
If were going to have a competitive economy we need to be building America again, 1959, 1974
And we also need to do more advanced manufacturing, 1974, 1983
And some of the most exciting developments I saw throughout this whole campaign were right here in Iowa, 1983, 2001
I saw in your community colleges some of the most advanced training that Ive seen anywhere in the country, 2001, 2020
And I met young men and women who were getting credentialed to be able to leave high school to get good jobs as machinists and tool and die makers and as designers using 3-D printing, 2020, 2055
I was so impressed, 2055, 2059
And I think we need to do that across America, 2059, 2069
And we need to bring technical education back to our high schools, 2069, 2081
It was a mistake when we took vocational education out of our high schools." "Another way that Iowa has influenced and inspired me is what youve done with clean renewable energy, 2081, 2112
Now it wasnt a partisan issue in Iowa, 2112, 2120
It really got a big boost from your wonderful former governor Tom Vilsack, 2120, 2133
But its been continued over the years, 2133, 2140
And look at the results, 2140, 2145
Look how much energy you are getting here in Iowa from clean renewable sources most particularly wind, 2145, 2162
Right? And look at the number of jobs – its nearly 10000 jobs now that are related to that, 2162, 2181
Plus the renewable fuel standard which has motivated people to be creative about using biological material and experimenting with cellulosic material, 2181, 2202
I was in the forefront of moving toward a clean renewable energy future and Im excited by that." "Im running against someone who thinks climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, 2202, 2235
I know its real, 2235, 2239
I believe in science, 2239, 2243
But Ill tell you what else is real, 2243, 2251
Whats real are the economic opportunities the new jobs and businesses were going to create by assuming the responsibility to combat climate change and the young people of our country are going to lead the way to doing that, 2251, 2290
Now we also need to help small businesses, 2290, 2298
Iowa is filled with small businesses, 2298, 2304
It should be easier to start one it shouldnt be so cumbersome to deal with all the multitude of regulations, 2304, 2324
Were going to try to streamline that process, 2324, 2332
Being the daughter of a small businessperson I believe in giving people the chance to have their destinies in their own hands, 2332, 2354
And were going to work hard, 2354, 2360
I want to be a first-class small business president in honor of my dad and Im going to do everything I can to help you get started and grow small businesses." "But while were growing the economy we need to make it fairer, 2360, 2403
And here are a couple of things I want to do, 2403, 2414
Lets raise the national minimum wage so people who work full-time are not still in poverty, 2414, 2430
Ive met – you know two thirds of the people on minimum wage are women – and Ive met a lot of minimum-wage workers right here in Iowa and across America, 2430, 2461
Sometimes they have to take two minimum-wage jobs because a full-time minimum wage job will earn you $15000 at the end of a full-time year of work, 2461, 2488
We also could give the biggest boost to incomes and particularly family incomes if we finally guaranteed equal pay for womens work." "And the other thing I want to do is make sure more companies adopt profit-sharing so if you helped to create the profits all of you not just the top executives will be able to share in those profits, 2488, 2549
You know at the debate the other night one of my well-known supporters Mark Cuban was there in the front row, 2549, 2570
And he really I think unsettled my opponent, 2570, 2578
But Ill tell you Mark Cubans a real billionaire who actually uses profit-sharing and not only while the business is ongoing but one thing I really appreciate: first business he sold he shared the profits with all of his employees, 2578, 2618
300 employees became millionaires because they had a boss who rewarded them for the hard work they did to make it a successful company all together." "And the final point I want to make about this is about family economics, 2618, 2658
You know lets tackle the cost of childcare, 2658, 2666
Between 2000 and 2012 childcare costs went up 25 percent, 2666, 2676
Incomes barely budged right? So were going to increase federal investment and provide more tax relief to working families so no parent has to pay more than 10 percent of their income for quality childcare, 2676, 2711
Now if you dont have small children or grandchildren right now you might not realize the cost of childcare in a lot of states is more expensive than tuition at public colleges and universities, 2711, 2745
A lot of families are just so stressed out." "The other thing I want to do is to finally have our country join the rest of the advanced economies and provide paid family leave so you can take care of your family members, 2745, 2788
Now a lot of people think this is primarily about newborn babies adopted babies and of course thats a big part of it, 2788, 2811
Last year in Newton a mom said to me Im counting on you to know what its like trying to take care of a newborn and having to go right back to work, 2811, 2844
Right?" "Thats a lot of you, 2844, 2850
There you are, 2850, 2853
Okay, 2853, 2854
And Ive got to tell you I hear that all over, 2854, 2865
When my granddaughter was born and I was in the hospital with my daughter I was talking to one of the nurses and I said so what is your biggest worry? She said well my biggest worry is that so many of these new moms have to go right back to work, 2865, 2917
Right back to work, 2917, 2921
But its not just for babies, 2921, 2927
Its for sick children sick spouses elderly members of your family who are having health problems, 2927, 2943
There is nothing more important than caring for each other, 2943, 2953
And I will tell you it is wrong to make it so difficult for American families." The other big expense for family economics is education, 2953, 2978
Every one of our children deserve good teachers and good schools no matter what zip code they live in right? And we also have to make college affordable, 2978, 3006
Yesterday in New Hampshire I was with my friend and my former opponent Senator Bernie Sanders, 3006, 3022
I am very proud of the campaign that Bernie and I ran, 3022, 3034
It was a campaign about issues not insults, 3034, 3042
And we shared a lot of the same goals even though we have different ways of getting there, 3042, 3060
And so after it was over he and I sat down and we began to hammer out some ideas about what we could do together, 3060, 3085
And one of them was to make college tuition free for any family whose income is $125000 or less, 3085, 3104
And to make it debt-free for everybody else so that you only pay what you can afford to pay without going into debt, 3104, 3127
"Now right now Iowans hold more than $12 billion in outstanding federal student loans, 3127, 3141
An education should give you a boost not hold you back, 3141, 3152
And were going to offer relief to those of you who already have debt, 3152, 3166
We have 40 million people who already have student debt in America 300000 of them right here in Iowa, 3166, 3185
Were going to help you refinance, 3185, 3191
It is outrageous that you can get a home mortgage at 3 percent a car payment at 2 percent and I met people in Iowa who were paying 8 10 12 percent interest on their student loans, 3191, 3228
Ill tell you what, 3228, 3232
I am not going to let the federal government make a profit off of lending money to young people to get their educations." "And college is crucial but this is not said often enough, 3232, 3266
Four-year college is not and should not be the only path to a good job that supports a middle-class life, 3266, 3286
So were going to have real apprenticeships not the kind where youre told youre fired but the kind where youre told youre hired, 3286, 3309
Were going to help more people in high school and community college on the job learn a skill." "So Im excited about what we can do together, 3309, 3336
I know so much of this campaign has been about you know whatever my opponent says and who he attacks and who he derides and denigrates, 3336, 3362
And the list is long, 3362, 3367
But its not about that, 3367, 3372
Its about you, 3372, 3375
Its about your families and your futures and each of us should be telling you what we intend to do in the job, 3375, 3398
Now I have this old-fashioned idea, 3398, 3404
Im asking for your vote, 3404, 3409
I should tell you what Im going to do what my plans are, 3409, 3422
So Tim Kane and I have actually put out this little paperback book, 3422, 3435
And I see somebody holding one in the front row, 3435, 3445
Its called not surprisingly Stronger Together, 3445, 3451
You can pick it up at a bookstore or an airport wherever they sell paperbacks, 3451, 3466
And you can see what were trying to do and where were going to get the money to pay for it, 3466, 3487
And the simple answer to that is were going to make the wealthy and corporations finally pay their fair share to support America." "Now my friends my opponent has a very different vision for America, 3487, 3522
He actually bragged about gaming the system to get out of paying his fair share in taxes maybe not paying any taxes at all, 3522, 3546
And what I really find so disturbing about this is he spends all of his time just dumping on America, 3546, 3566
Calling us a third world country, 3566, 3572
Saying our military is a disaster, 3572, 3578
That everything about America is in bad shape, 3578, 3586
But then its probably true he hasnt paid a penny in federal taxes to actually support our military or our vets or our schools or our roads or our education systems, 3586, 3617
He actually is proud of the fact that he lets everybody else pay taxes, 3617, 3631
He says that makes him smart." "Well Ill tell you what if not paying taxes makes him smart what does that make the rest of us? My husband and I have put 40 years of our tax returns out into the public, 3631, 3673
You can go and look at them and you can see that weve been blessed and were grateful for that, 3673, 3693
But we have paid the highest marginal tax rates and we are glad we could because we have both benefited from this great country of ours and we want to pass that on to the next generation and the one after that." "Donald Trump is also proud that he rooted for the housing crisis back in 2008 and -9, 3693, 3752
Think about that, 3752, 3755
Five million families lost their homes, 3755, 3761
And he rooted for it because he said he could make money off of it, 3761, 3776
He even said that it is just business, 3776, 3784
Well what kind of person believes that – that throwing people out of their homes foreclosing on them destroying the dreams of hardworking people is just business? Well Ill tell you thats a person who should never be president because they dont understand the American dream and how hard it is for people to make it." "So look I think after – Thank you, 3784, 3848
I think after what we saw Monday night well have two more debates to be able to contrast and compare, 3848, 3868
I have no idea what hes going to say the next time, 3868, 3880
But you know I will spend some time preparing for it." "But we cant do any of the things that I just talked about or anything that you see in our book without your help, 3880, 3915
The future of our country the future of our economy and the future of our society will be on the ballot, 3915, 3936
It breaks my heart to see all the mean-spirited divisive bigoted things that are being said in our country, 3936, 3955
We can have our differences for heaven sakes, 3955, 3963
Were Americans; thats in our DNA, 3963, 3969
But we should respect one another, 3969, 3975
We should listen to one another, 3975, 3981
Thats the way were going to get things done together." "And so I want you to join this campaign, 3981, 4000
The election will be close but we can win Iowa and were going to win on November 8th, 4000, 4018
