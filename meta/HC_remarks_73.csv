 Oh thank you all so much, 0, 6
Thank you, 6, 8
Oh you are great, 8, 12
Thank you, 12, 14
"Oh my goodness, 14, 17
Ill tell you it was worth it trying to get here, 17, 28
You have been so generous with your time, 28, 36
And Im just so grateful to be back in Marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you now less than a week until the caucus on Monday night, 36, 66
But its just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process and I really am grateful to each and every one of you." "Ive learned a lot in the last months and I really think that spending all this time in small groups and big ones is going to make me a better president, 66, 127
So I thank you for everything youve done to make that possible, 127, 139
"  "And I really want to thank Mark Smith for his endorsement, 139, 151
Im thrilled, 151, 153
Thank you so very much Representative, 153, 159
And I have a—I have a plan that I hope will come to pass when it—that affects Mark, 159, 177
And that is I hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the House of Representatives in the state legislature, 177, 202
"  Think of all the good things that he could do for you and for people across Iowa, 202, 220
"Well its getting close, 220, 224
And when all of you decide to go caucus on Monday youre going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country." "And I know how seriously Iowans take this because Ive been talking with you and listening to you, 224, 283
But I want to just spend a few minutes really discussing whats at stake because this is one of the most consequential elections that weve had in quite some time." When you think about it there are some very big differences between us and the Republicans and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand, 283, 346
Well I will tell you where I stand, 346, 354
"I believe that the Republican policies that are being promoted by this crop of candidates that are traveling across our state and country would set our country back rip up the progress weve made and undermine our future, 354, 392
And that is true across the board but let me just pick a few of the most important issues, 392, 411
Lets take the economy." "You heard from them they are spouting the same failed economic policies: trickle-down economics; cut taxes on the wealthy; get out of the way of corporations, 411, 441
We have tried that it does not work, 441, 449
And its important to know the facts, 449, 456
And the facts are that our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for Americans, 456, 484
"  "And the last two Democratic presidents weve had both of whom I know which I kind of am proud of they each inherited economic problems from their Republican predecessors." You know in my husbands case it was a recession a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit, 484, 541
So when he got to Washington people said "OK, 541, 550
So what do you especially bring to Washington that can make a difference?" He said "Well I guess I bring arithmetic, 550, 571
Were going to make it add up again for the American people." And at the end of eight years we did, 571, 592
Twenty-three million new jobs but most importantly incomes went up for everybody, 592, 604
Not just those at the top hard-working middle-class families working families poor families, 604, 617
More people were lifted out of poverty than in any recent time in our history, 617, 632
And we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus, 632, 643
We were on the right track, 643, 649
Well back came the Republicans and back came trickle-down economics, 649, 659
George W, 659, 661
Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on Wall Street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face, 661, 710
"Now we know what happened dont we? We went into the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression and when Barack Obama became president we were losing 800000 jobs a month, 710, 741
I dont think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the Republicans put us in during their administration, 741, 768
"  And it was not easy, 768, 774
I know; I talked to him about it, 774, 782
When he asked me to be secretary of State he said "We got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world." "And what did he do? Well were back on track with 14 million new jobs, 782, 833
The Affordable Care Act was passed, 833, 839
Were now at 90 percent health care coverage in America for the first time, 839, 853
"  He passed and signed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s the Dodd-Frank law; saved the auto industry which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another you know couple of million jobs down with them, 853, 895
We ended up losing 9 million because of that Great Recession 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out, 895, 920
"Now if you want to go back there you got a lot of folks including one who was here today who are spouting that same stuff because thats where well end up again, 920, 953
In fact you are four times more likely to see a recession in America when you have a Republican in the White House." "So the economy is going to be at the core of this election, 953, 989
So you should ask everybody whos running what theyre going to do about it, 989, 1003
And I got to tell you Im proud of what weve been doing on the Democratic side, 1003, 1020
We have our differences but we have differences over issues and thats what we talk about not insults which is what happens among the Republicans." "So Ive put out a plan, 1020, 1051
Here is what I think we need to do, 1051, 1060
We need more infrastructure jobs, 1060, 1065
Our roads our bridges our tunnels our ports our airports our rail systems our sewer systems our water systems, 1065, 1084
We have work to do in our country and those are jobs that cant be exported they need to be done right here and put Americans back to work building our economy making us more competitive." "And then were going to take the tax system and get rid of the incentives that actually encourage people to take jobs and move them overseas take factories and build them overseas, 1084, 1152
Were going to reverse that so we start investing in America again advance manufacturing, 1152, 1166
I know it can be done because Ive been to some of your community colleges, 1166, 1181
I have seen the work that is happening there the training that is going on." "I also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change were going to create more clean renewable energy jobs, 1181, 1221
And that will be a huge economic opportunity—" —that is directly linked to what Iowa has been doing, 1221, 1239
You know the Republicans when you ask them about climate change they all say the same thing, 1239, 1256
"Well I dont know Im not a scientist." You know theres an easy way to remedy that, 1256, 1273
Go talk to a scientist listen to a scientist learn about whats going on, 1273, 1287
And you know thats bad enough that theyre into denial, 1287, 1297
What really is troubling is theyre missing this huge economic opportunity, 1297, 1308
"And when I tell people that I see you know sometimes folks around the country have a little bit of skepticism on their faces and heres what I tell them, 1308, 1338
I know we can create those jobs because look at what Iowa has done." And I want you to thank Representative Smith, 1338, 1360
Thank you, 1360, 1362
And it started with Tom Vilsack and the Democrats making a commitment, 1362, 1374
Iowa now gets one-third of your electricity from renewable sources mostly wind, 1374, 1386
"You have 7000 people already working in the wind industry in this state, 1386, 1399
You are doing research on advanced biofuels that the Defense Department thinks may be able to fuel Navy vessels and Air Force planes, 1399, 1422
So Iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower, 1422, 1445
Its either going to be China Germany or us, 1445, 1454
I want it to be us and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and were going to be doing the technology the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world, 1454, 1493
"  "We also need to be focusing on small business because thats where most of the jobs come from in America, 1493, 1514
And I want to be the small business president, 1514, 1523
My dad was a small businessman so I want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again, 1523, 1544
And especially young people, 1544, 1548
S lot of young people tell me theyd love to go into business but they cant get credit, 1548, 1566
Part of it is they have such student debts they cant get credit; weve got to fix that, 1566, 1584
So we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business." "Now there are two ways we can raise incomes real quick, 1584, 1609
One weve got to raise the minimum wage, 1609, 1617
People who work full time should not still be in poverty, 1617, 1628
"  "There should be a ladder of opportunity, 1628, 1636
And the other way is to guarantee equal pay for womens work and that will raise incomes and families will be better off the economy will be, 1636, 1663
"  "Now everything Ive just said to you the Republicans dont agree with it every bit of it, 1663, 1681
They dont believe in any of it, 1681, 1688
They dont really tell you what they will do except just you know get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their you know big donors do whatever they want, 1688, 1724
Well thats not going to work, 1724, 1730
We know it wont and we cant be sold that bill of goods again." "The other thing we have to do is to change the tax system so that it is fairer, 1730, 1762
And Im am the only candidate running on either side who has made this pledge, 1762, 1777
I will raise your incomes I will not raise middle-class taxes, 1777, 1788
I do not think it is right—" —to be going to people who suffered because of the Republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future, 1788, 1820
I want you to take advantage of them but I want to go where the money is and the money is at the top and thats where we need to be shifting our tax system, 1820, 1855
So we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use like this thing called the "carried interest loophole" that Ive been against for years, 1855, 1886
We also need to do what Warren Buffett suggested, 1886, 1895
I was really very happy that he endorsed me and I went to Omaha with him, 1895, 1911
And we were standing there and he— "—he said you know Im not too popular among my rich friends these days because I think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country, 1911, 1950
And he has something he calls the Buffett rule, 1950, 1959
Anybody who makes $1 million should have to pay a 30 percent effective tax rate, 1959, 1974
So Ive adopted the Buffett rule and were going to go right at it and try to get that done, 1974, 1994
"  "And then I want to go further I want to impose what I call a fair share surcharge on incomes of $5 million or more, 1994, 2020
Now there arent very many of those but theres a lot of money there because I want to use that money to make college affordable, 2020, 2045
I want to use that money to invest in clean energy, 2045, 2056
I want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families, 2056, 2089
I want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care which in some states is as expensive as college tuition, 2089, 2114
There are things we can do that will relieve the burdens on middle-class families and the money should come from those who have it." Now people say to me "Well how are we ever going to get that done?" Well I do have a political strategy, 2114, 2160
Ive seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years, 2160, 2172
There are not that many people who make $5 million or more in America and I think we can make a very clear case, 2172, 2196
"Mr, 2196, 2197
Congressman over there are you in favor of clean energy and affordable college? Are you in favor of early childhood education and the way were going to get it is to tax the two people in your district who make more than $5 million? Or are you going to deny that to the 350000 people who live in your district?" "Were going to make a very tough case about why we have to make the tax code fairer, 2197, 2275
You know you can talk about it but I have a plan to do it, 2275, 2290
Not just a plan on the substance but a political plan because I want you to know what I aim to do for you and what it will cost you, 2290, 2320
And I want everybody to be able to look at that and make your own judgment." I also have what has been described as the toughest most effective comprehensive plan to go after Wall Street, 2320, 2355
"Now I totally agree with my two esteemed opponents Senator Sanders and Governor OMalley that weve got to keep our eyes on the big banks, 2355, 2380
And no bank is too big to fail and no executive is too powerful to jail, 2380, 2396
But we already have the authority to go after them, 2396, 2406
That was in the Dodd-Frank bill, 2406, 2412
We dont have to do that we just have to implement it, 2412, 2424
And I have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy I will go after them and I will use the process President Obama signed into law." "But heres where I differ with my two friends—that is not enough, 2424, 2465
And this is what weve been arguing about on the debate stage, 2465, 2477
You see it wasnt just the big banks that caused our problems it was an investment bank like Lehman Brothers, 2477, 2497
It was a big insurance conglomerate called AIG, 2497, 2505
It was a mortgage company called Countrywide, 2505, 2512
It was another bank not one of the big five called Wachovia and others who are in what is called the shadow banking sector." "So what Ive is were going after risk wherever it is in the financial system, 2512, 2551
And Paul Krugman the Nobel Prize-winning economist said I have the best plan, 2551, 2564
Barney Frank who is actually the Frank in Dodd-Frank said I have the best plan because Im trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again but what could happen in the future." "And you know the best evidence I have that I have the best plan is that the Republicans and their billionaire allies are running ads against me, 2564, 2632
You know it started a few weeks ago, 2632, 2640
These two hedge fund billionaires formed a super PAC to run ads against me to convince Democrats not to support me, 2640, 2661
And then along came Karl Rove you know the errand boy for the billionaires and hes now running an ad against me, 2661, 2683
And now another billionaire has jumped in and hes now running an ad against me." Now you got to stop to think why are they spending all this money to try to convince Democrats not to support me? Well I think you know the answer because they know that I say what I mean I do what I say I will do and I know how to get it done to take after them to prevent them from— —pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy, 2683, 2770
"Now another area where I have very strong feelings and share exactly the same goal as Senator Sanders is health care, 2770, 2791
You know I believe in universal health care coverage, 2791, 2800
Every American should have it, 2800, 2805
You know before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare back in 93 and 94 when I was trying to get universal health care and we were not successful, 2805, 2835
And that was really disappointing." "I mean the drug companies the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us, 2835, 2854
So we didnt succeed, 2854, 2858
And then I got to thinking well what can I do now? Because you know my view is when youre knocked down you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something, 2858, 2892
The real question is whether you get back up, 2892, 2901
So I started thinking what can I do that can help somebody make a difference in their lives." And I remembered when I was traveling around the country trying to get universal health care meeting so many people who did not have health insurance they couldnt afford it they had a pre-existing condition and the insurance companies wouldnt give it to them, 2901, 2963
And I met so many really good decent people who are so overwhelmed by what was happening to them, 2963, 2982
And I remember I was at the Childrens Hospital in Cleveland, 2982, 2993
I was meeting with a group of parents whose kids were really sick with chronic diseases, 2993, 3009
And one man said to me he said "You know Ive gone everywhere to try to get insurance for my daughters, 3009, 3030
I have two girls with cystic fibrosis and nobody will sell it to me." "I said what do they say when you go ask them and you tell them you want to try to pay for something? They say no, 3030, 3070
He said Ill tell you what the last person told me at the insurance company I visited, 3070, 3087
He said we dont insure burning houses, 3087, 3094
This man said they called my little girls burning houses, 3094, 3104
And that stuck with me that and the stories I heard, 3104, 3115
So I started to work with Democrats and Republicans and we created the Childrens Health Insurance Program and it now insures eight million kids because when you get—" "—you encounter an obstacle you run into a problem youve got to keep going, 3115, 3157
You cant ever stop if youre trying to accomplish something that will help other people, 3157, 3172
And I was thrilled when the president passed and signed the Affordable Care Act." "Weve been trying to get that—the Democratic party has been trying to get that accomplished since Harry Truman, 3172, 3204
And now I meet people all the time who are benefiting from it, 3204, 3217
I want to build on it and I want to improve it, 3217, 3229
You know the Republicans want to repeal it and thats what theyll do if they get the White House back, 3229, 3249
We cant let that happen." Here is what I want to do, 3249, 3261
I want to decrease costs out-of-pocket costs; decrease prescription drug costs, 3261, 3272
  "I want to make sure that we get the authority for Medicare to negotiate for lower drug costs with the drug companies, 3272, 3294
I want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs, 3294, 3313
I want to take away their tax benefits, 3313, 3321
They actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on TV to us that we never—I cant understand what theyre talking about." They have people walking through fields of wildflowers walking on beaches, 3321, 3356
They have the name of the drug which you know is unpronounceable, 3356, 3368
And then in a low voice under the music they have somebody saying if you take this drug you know your nose will fall off, 3368, 3393
I mean it— "—drives you crazy, 3393, 3399
And they spend more money advertising on TV than they spend on research, 3399, 3412
So were going to go right at them, 3412, 3420
Were going to take them on on this." "But I dont want to start over my friends, 3420, 3437
Thats the disagreement I have with Senator Sanders, 3437, 3445
I want us to build on what we have and make it better and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of Americans, 3445, 3469
I dont want to start at zero and have to—" "—fight it all over again have to have the national battle we that we had on health care over the last 25 years, 3469, 3502
So Im determined that were going to make this work for everybody and I know its the right thing to do, 3502, 3523
And I hope that you know we will be able to get your costs down your co-pays your deductibles what you know a lot of people are telling me are starting to pinch again." "I also will defend Social Security against privatization, 3523, 3565
The Republicans still want to privatize it, 3565, 3572
Theyre still talking about that, 3572, 3577
Its a terrible idea, 3577, 3581
And you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire Social Security trust fund over to Wall Street, 3581, 3605
Thats what this is all about, 3605, 3611
Take all that money that people have been paying in for you know 75 80 years and turn it over to Wall Street, 3611, 3634
I will never let that happen, 3634, 3640
That is the worst—" —idea that is imaginable, 3640, 3648
"I will also not let them voucherize Medicare something else they want to do and I will not let them privatize the VA, 3648, 3671
We have to fix the VA but we are not going to take away guaranteed benefits from our veterans who have earned them through their service, 3671, 3697
Thats not going to happen, 3697, 3702
"  "And when it comes to foreign policy and national security well I think we have a lot to do to keep our country safe and I have some ideas that Ive been putting out based on what I did in the Senate after 9/11 based on my work as secretary of State." "Its imperative that we do everything we can to defeat ISIS to stop the flow of foreign fighters and funding to fight them on the Internet where theyre quite effective without putting American troops back on the ground in either Syria or Iraq, 3702, 3798
"  "That will not happen, 3798, 3803
Its not—its not going to happen on my watch, 3803, 3812
And then we have to do a better job working with federal state and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks." "When I was a senator after 9/11 Id be kept up-to-date on all the threats that still were facing New York and we had a very very dedicated group of police and federal law enforcement and everyone who worked together, 3812, 3893
But you know one of the best things we did was a campaign which said If you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious report it, 3893, 3920
And so people were picking up the phone and telling the police or maybe calling the FBI and it really provided kind of the—the eyes-on help that we needed, 3920, 3949
And people could then follow up and we prevented attacks, 3949, 3959
We foiled attacks." "Well the reason I mention that is because of this, 3959, 3972
The Republican candidates led by their frontrunner have been attacking Muslims right? Youve heard that attacking American Muslims attacking Muslims around the world, 3972, 3995
Thats not only shameful its dangerous, 3995, 4001
We need everybody in this country to be on the same team when it comes to preventing terrorist attacks, 4001, 4020
"  "And we need people who are in the community who hear something see something to report it and not feel like theyre being demonized defamed insulted pushed out, 4020, 4049
And certainly if were going to defeat ISIS we need a coalition that includes Muslim nations." "Now I can tell you I built the coalition that imposed sanctions on Iran, 4049, 4079
I know a little bit about how you do this, 4079, 4089
You dont start by insulting peoples religion and then ask them to be part of your effort to defeat a common adversary, 4089, 4111
"  "Thats not the way it works in the real world, 4111, 4122
So we have to be smart about how we protect ourselves and that will be my highest priority." I also want to continue to move toward comprehensive immigration reform which I think is in the best interest of our country and our economy, 4122, 4165
  And I want to let you know where I stand on a lot of the issues that the Republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that I support, 4165, 4203
"I am for a womans right—a womans right to make her own health decisions and I am against defunding Planned Parenthood, 4203, 4224
"  I am for marriage equality and against discrimination against the LGBT community, 4224, 4237
I am against Citizens United which is a terrible decision that has opened the doors to floods of unaccountable money from the Koch Brothers and others, 4237, 4263
And I would do everything I can to reverse that decision, 4263, 4274
I also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system, 4274, 4290
And I want to fight for common sense gun safety measures that will help keep—  " —Americans safe without infringing on gun owners rights." "We are a smart—we are a smart people, 4290, 4322
We can do this, 4322, 4326
And what I dont understand is how when we know we have on average 90 people a day dying from gun violence 33000 people a year we cannot figure out how to protect people protect first-graders going to school people going to a movie theater churchgoers going to Bible study, 4326, 4376
We can do this, 4376, 4380
We cant stop every murder or every suicide or every tragic avoidable accident but we can stop a lot of them without infringing on anybodys rights." And 92 percent of the American people agree with that and 85 percent of gun owners agree with that, 4380, 4425
So we need somebody who will stand up to the gun lobby and stop them from intimidating common sense reforms in our country, 4425, 4448
  "So we have a lot of work to do my friends, 4448, 4459
And you have been really patient, 4459, 4465
The children who are still here have been especially patient and I dont want to keep you any longer." I just want to say a few closing comments and then for those of you who want to stay I will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions, 4465, 4517
But everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because I need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next Monday, 4517, 4551
  "And you know I am all about—I am all about making progress against the odds, 4551, 4566
I am all about working with people, 4566, 4573
I worked with Republicans as first lady as senator as secretary of State, 4573, 4586
I worked to get results for the people I represented in the Senate as well as our country, 4586, 4604
I worked when I was secretary of State to make our country safe and to have our values and interests promoted, 4604, 4625
And I know how to find common ground because Ive done it." "I dont think that—I think I—I do believe that probably every Republican I served with at one time or another sponsored a piece of my legislation, 4625, 4663
Actually when Im not running for something they say nice things about me, 4663, 4676
"  "Even in the case of Mr, 4676, 4683
Trump they give me money because they think Im so good as a candidate and a senator, 4683, 4700
So you know this is politics, 4700, 4706
This is all that that goes on."
