"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the End Citizens United PAC an organization working tirelessly to fix our broken campaign finance system and restore control of our elections to the American people, 0, 35
"I have said from the beginning of my campaign that we need to be protecting peoples right to vote not corporations right to buy elections, 35, 60

"And it means overturning the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and putting our democracy back in the hands of the voters, 98, 120
In my first 30 days as President I will propose a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, 120, 137
I will appoint Supreme Court justices who understand that this decision deeply hurt our democracy and I will fight for other progressive reforms to our campaign finance system including more robust disclosure requirements and measures that will make it easier for people who arent rich or well-connected to run for office like small-donor matching, 137, 191
"But we cant stop there, 191, 196

Together we can restore peoples voices and peoples votes to their rightful place–at the center of American democracy." , 219, 237
