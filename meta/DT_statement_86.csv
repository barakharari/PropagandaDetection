"The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying â€˜Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC, 0, 25
The RNC does not treat me well and then they use my name without my knowledge to raise money for themselves, 25, 46
At my insistence they have withdrawn their request, 46, 54
I am self-funding my campaign and this totally unauthorized notice is yet another example of deceptive Washington tricks used to take advantage of the voters and get money from the hard-working people the politicians have failed, 54, 90
I will not stand for it and neither should you." , 90, 100
