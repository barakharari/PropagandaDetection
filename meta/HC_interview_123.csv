 Well have my interview this morning with Donald Trump in just a few minutes, 0, 14
But were going to begin with the Democrats and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, 14, 29
You liked that "graveyard of pollsters" line didnt you? " Well Ive lived through this twice —" " Youve lived through this." " — in 92 and 2008, 29, 57
And look I know Im behind, 57, 63
And Im going to keep fighting until the very last vote is counted because I care about this primary."  Why do you think you started with such a big deficit this time considering — look this has been a big state to both your husband and yourself very important, 63, 112
 Yes, 112, 113
" Theyve always helped you." " Well look I cant sit here and analyze all the reasons, 113, 130
Obviously one is that the senator has been in public life next door for 25 years, 130, 146
So theres a familiarity with him, 146, 152
I totally respect that, 152, 156
And I just think that whats great about this primary is New Hampshire voters take a first second third fourth fifth look, 156, 178
I mean yesterday as I was crisscrossing from one side of the state to the other talking to voters I literally had people come up say you changed my mind you know who knows, 178, 212
I mean this is whats so exciting about the primary Chuck, 212, 223
I came in in 2008 as I recall like 16 points behind, 223, 235
I remember the night before the primary in 92 Bills pollster saying you know youre in single digits, 235, 253
Its over, 253, 255
Who knows, 255, 257
I love this excitement, 257, 261
And you know Im going to fight as hard as I can, 261, 273
But Im having a great time whatever happens."  All right, 273, 283
Lets — I want to go to the debate a little bit because I would say the foreign policy section is one that you guys wanted to highlight because you felt as if he didnt do so well, 283, 321
You brought up Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to talk about it, 321, 333
But some of the things that you said about Senator Obamas readiness on foreign policy they are very similar to what youve said about Bernie Sanders, 333, 359
In 08 you said "I have a lifetime of experience that I will bring to the White House, 359, 377
I know Senator McCain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the White House." Senator Obama has a speech he gave in 2002; it sounds very similar to what you said when youre like OK you had one vote on the Iraq war —  Well you know what — " Whats the difference between what you said about then- Senator Obama and what youre saying about Senator Sanders?" " Theres a very big difference, 377, 454
In 2008 Senator Obama had really done his homework in the Senate, 454, 466
Hed been there by that time a few years, 466, 475
He had developed a network of advisors on national security and foreign policy issues, 475, 489
They were very diligent and focused on making sure he was ready that he had as broad a set of views as possible, 489, 512
And they really went toe-to-toe with all the people supporting me, 512, 523
Thats not happening in this campaign, 523, 529
There really isnt any kind of foreign policy network that is supporting and advising Senator Sanders, 529, 545
Ill let him speak for himself, 545, 551
I think that whats important is this job requires you to be ready on all aspects of it on the first day, 551, 573
And we know we got a particularly complex world right now, 573, 584
And the presidents not going to have the time, 584, 593
Maybe previous presidents in past years could have a little more leeway because of you know the way the world functioned, 593, 614
But now its North Korea with its missile tests its Russian aggression its enforcing the Iran agreement, 614, 631
You have to do it all at once."  Do you think the Iraq vote should still matter to voters? " Look I think that voters are perfectly free to take into account anything they want to take, 631, 668
But I also hope theyll take the rest of the record, 668, 679
You know I was involved in the biggest counterterrorism decision in the Obama administration to determine whether or not to go after bin Laden, 679, 703
I did put the sanctions on Iran to get them to the negotiating table, 703, 717
I think that this is a debate that the voters really have to pay attention to because it is choosing both a president and a commander in chief." " Im curious do you believe if it wasnt for the Iraq War we wouldnt have ISIS today?" " Well I think thats a hard conclusion to draw because remember we had Al Qaeda before we had ISIS, 717, 783
Al Qaeda attacked us in New York, 783, 790
Al Qaeda attacked our embassies in Africa —"   " The argument is that the instability in Iraq is what has created this and that if we — that if Saddam Hussein were still there we wouldnt have ISIS." " Well I think thats a lot of jumps in logic that to me doesnt really add up, 790, 846
The Iraq War theres no doubt contributed to instability, 846, 855
Im not going to in any way deny that, 855, 864
But you cannot draw a direct line, 864, 871
What you can do is to say that jihadist terrorism starting with Al Qaeda —"  Right, 871, 887
" — and moving onto its latest incarnations most particularly ISIS is in response to a number of forces and factors that are roiling up the Middle East, 887, 915
And certainly fighting for what Islam means and how its going to be presented and what people are going to mean when they talk about it — so yes weve got a much bigger set of problems." " All right, 915, 955
Another thing I wanted to follow up on the debate, 955, 965
Senator Sanders called the entire business model of Wall Street a fraud, 965, 977
We didnt get a chance to ask you to respond directly to that critique, 977, 991
Id like to ask you to respond to it now." " Well I think its the kind of extreme statement that once you really take a hard look at it its hard to understand, 991, 1025
You know when you talk about Wall Street are we talking about every bank? Or are we talking about a particular part of New York? Thats never really clarified, 1025, 1054
What I believe is that there are good actors and bad actors in every part of our economy, 1054, 1072
The job of the president is to weed out and prevent the bad actors from disrupting economic activity from amassing too much power and influence, 1072, 1097
But we live in a complex global economy where weve got to have a good banking system that is able to service the American economy, 1097, 1122
And it needs to be more than just looking at the five banks that are the big banks, 1122, 1140
We have to have a much more robust community banking system regional banking system other forms of credit access, 1140, 1159
And thats what I am advocating for, 1159, 1166
And I still do not understand why Im having this problem getting Senator Sanders to join me in going after what are the potential problems that are out there the shadow banking sector and the investment and hedge fund sector." " Do you — can you have a Treasury Secretary who isnt familiar with how Wall Street works? And I say this because I think theres so much distrust right now."  Yes, 1166, 1238
There is, 1238, 1240
There is, 1240, 1242
" On Wall Street, 1242, 1246
Six of the last Treasury Secretaries either came from Wall Street or went to Wall Street after, 1246, 1263
I think there certainly right now isnt an appetite for somebody from Wall Street to be the next Treasury Secretary, 1263, 1283
And yet can you have a Treasury Secretary if they dont understand Wall Street?"  Well you have to have a Treasury Secretary who understands the economy the American economy and the global economy, 1283, 1316
I think there are a lot more places where one can and should look for such a Treasury Secretary —    Do you think you can pick one without having them have a Wall Street background? " You know I want somebody who can make a good commitment to work with me to get the economy moving to get more good jobs created to get incomes rising to look out over the horizon at some of the economic problems that are out there, 1316, 1398
Weve got to figure out what were going to do with China, 1398, 1410
China is finally having to come to grips with the fact that a lot of its growth may not have been as on a firm foundation as we would hope, 1410, 1440
So we need people in government who have that kind of commitment and understanding, 1440, 1454
But weve got to put the needs of the American economy first, 1454, 1466
And thats going to be my commitment." " Before I let you go I want to ask you about a comment Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said — a comment that Ive heard her say before, 1466, 1503
But it sort of rang differently to a lot of people, 1503, 1514
She said theres a special place in hell for women who dont help women, 1514, 1528
But the implication is that somehow if youre a Democratic woman and youre not supporting you whats wrong with you? Do you want the vote to be decided on gender lines like that?"  Oh look you know as you remember Madeleine has been saying this for many many years, 1528, 1577
 Starbucks cups I think centers on that, 1577, 1584
I get that, 1584, 1587
" She believes it firmly and, 1587, 1593
in part because she knows what a struggle it has been, 1593, 1604
And she understands the struggle is not over, 1604, 1612
So I dont want people to be offended by what she is expressing as her very —"  You can understand why some might have been offended by it? " Well good grief were getting offended about everything these days, 1612, 1651
Honest to goodness I mean people cant say anything without offending somebody, 1651, 1663
She has a life experience that I respect, 1663, 1671
I admire her greatly, 1671, 1675
And I think what she was trying to do which shes done in every setting Ive ever seen her in going back 20-plus years was to remind young women particularly that this struggle which many of us have been part of is not over, 1675, 1719
And dont be in any way lulled by the progress weve made, 1719, 1731
And I think it was a light-hearted but very pointed remark which people can take however they choose."  All right, 1731, 1751
What do you got in the Super Bowl? " I dont have anybody right now." " You dont have anybody?" " Im going to Flint Michigan Im worrying about the kids in Flint Michigan trying to figure out what were going to do to make sure theyre not damaged irreparably by this —" " So youre going today you could have gone Wednesday, 1751, 1814
That says something about how you feel about New Hampshire?" " I love New Hampshire, 1814, 1829
And you know the mayor asked me to come, 1829, 1838
This was as early as we could get it done, 1838, 1848
I want to lend my support, 1848, 1854
Im very hopeful the Congress which is trying to work in a bipartisan way will come up with some funding to deal with these problems that have afflicted the community, 1854, 1884
And Im going to keep doing everything I can to help them."  Secretary Clinton I know you got a plane to catch, 1884, 1906
 Thanks, 1906, 1907
Great to talk to you, 1907, 1912
