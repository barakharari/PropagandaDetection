Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) has given DREAMers the freedom to provide for their families further their educations and live their lives without fear of being deported from the country they know and love, 23, 58

When we protect families not tear them apart, 293, 301
When we build bridges not walls, 301, 307
"It is why I co-sponsored legislation to protect DREAMers throughout my time in the senate as well as legislation to enact comprehensive immigration reform and it is why I will do everything in my power as president to protect President Obamas executive actions go further to provide relief for families and introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a path to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office." , 307, 377
