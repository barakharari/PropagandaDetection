{"text": "The Washington Post unfortunately covers Mr. Trump very inaccurately. Todays headline \"Donald Trump Suggests President Obama Was Involved With Orlando Shooting\" is a perfect example. We no longer feel compelled to work with a publication which has put its need for \"clicks\" above journalistic integrity. \"They have no journalistic integrity and write falsely about Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump does not mind a bad story but it has to be honest. The fact is The Washington Post is being used by the owners of Amazon as their political lobbyist so that they dont have to pay taxes and dont get sued for monopolistic tendencies that have led to the destruction of department stores and the retail industry.\" ", "date": "2016-06-13"}
