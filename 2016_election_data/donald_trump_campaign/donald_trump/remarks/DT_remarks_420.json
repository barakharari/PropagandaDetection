{"text": "Thank you. I am so thrilled to be back in Washington.n Together we are going to work hard over the next 70 days and we are going to win this state \u2013 and we are going to win the White House.n \"Its going to be a victory for the people. A victory for the everyday citizen whose voice hasnt been heard.n\" \"It will be a win for the voters \u2013 not the pundits not the journalists not the lobbyists not the global special interests funding my opponents campaign.n\" This is going to be YOUR victory.n We are going to create the New American Future our children deserve.n In this new future millions of workers on the sidelines will be returned to the workforce.n Crumbling roads bridges and airports will be replaced with the infrastructure our country needs and deserves.n Families trapped in welfare will be provided with jobs and opportunity.n Government will become lean effective responsible \u2013 and honest.n Our border will be protected and our children will be safe.n We will rebuild our inner cities and provide safety and peace to all of our citizens.n American values and culture will be cherished and celebrated once again.n But to achieve this future we must break free from the bitter failures of the past \u2013 and reject the same insiders telling us the same old lies.n One area where honesty is badly needed is on the subject of economic and living conditions for African-American citizens in the United States.n Millions of African-Americans in this country have succeeded greatly and their contributions to every area of our life \u2013 now and throughout our history \u2013 should be celebrated and cherished. This includes the amazing achievements in art science sport music medicine business and so much else. This includes millions of African-American entrepreneurs innovators and the millions of African-American workers in our middle class.n But we must also talk about those who have been left behind the millions suffering in disastrous conditions in so many of our inner cities \u2013 and neighborhoods afflicted by poverty drugs and violence.n \"No group in America has been more harmed by Hillary Clintons policies than African-Americans.n\" \"There is no better evidence of this fact than Hillary Clintons immigration policy which brings in illegal immigrants and refugees to take jobs from hardworking African-American and Hispanic citizens.n\" Instead of providing free healthcare and jobs to millions of refugees from around the world we should rebuild our inner cities and provide jobs to struggling Americans.n Tonight I am asking for the vote of every African-American and Hispanic citizen in this country who wants a better future.n The inner cities of our country have been run by the Democratic Party for fifty sixty seventy years.n These Democratic policies \u2013 the policies of Hillary Clinton \u2013 have produced only poverty joblessness failing schools broken homes and rising crime.n Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty including 45% of children under the age of six. 58% of African-American youth are not working. Meanwhile another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty since 2009.n In Detroit half of all its residents do not work. In Milwaukee almost 4 in 10 African-American men between the ages of 24-54 do not have a job.n Here in the state of Washington 65% of Latino children and 60% of African-American children live in low-income households.n Chicago just had the most violent month in 20 years. More than 2800 have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year.n It breaks our hearts.n We cannot let this violence continue. It must be ended.n Under A Trump Administration it will be ended.n It will be my priority to work with communities local police state police and federal law enforcement to dismantle the gangs and to liberate our citizens from violence and poverty and fear. I will appoint the best judges and prosecutors and federal investigators who will make this their personal mission.n There is one thing which can no longer be denied: if you keep voting for the same people you will keep getting the same results. To those suffering I say: what do you have to lose by voting for Donald Trump? I will fix it. I will fight for you as no one ever has before.n Let me also tell you what you have to gain: jobs opportunity security and safety.n This means so much to me.n I believe every child in this country \u2013 in Detroit in Baltimore in Chicago \u2013 has the right to live out their lives in safety and peace.n In the Wall Street Journal Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute just wrote an important article about the soaring crime in our inner cities and the responsibility of Democratic politicians for creating this problem.n The article is called: \"Black Lives Matter to Donald Trump.\" McDonald writes that \"Mr. Trumps call to restore law and order recognizes the right of inner-city residents to enjoy the same freedom from fear that the rest of America now takes for granted.\"n Freedom from violence is one of the great civil rights issues of our time. So too is the issue of school choice.n We will fight for the right of parents to send their kids to the school that they believe gives their kids the best shot at success.n I will not accept a future in which children of any color in this country are not fully included in the American Dream. Our whole country loses when we leave millions of talented aspiring Americans on the sidelines. We want to give everyone a chance to contribute their full talents to our economy and our country.n Remember: the Republican Party is the Party of Lincoln the party of freedom equality and opportunity. It is the Democratic Party that is the party of slavery the party of Jim Crow the party of oppression.n \"Nothing makes me more honored and proud than to be the nominee of Abraham Lincolns Republican Party.n\" Our party will fight to bring hope to every forgotten stretch of this country.n Once again we will be One American Nation.n One United People.n And we will have One Great Future.n That great future will be built on these three critical words: jobs jobs jobs.n \"This will include a complete revitalization of our manufacturing sector which has been so badly hurt by Hillary Clintons policies.n\" We are bringing the jobs back to our country.n We are going to renegotiate NAFTA keep out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership stand up to China and fight for every last American job.n The destruction that NAFTA started will be finished off if the Trans-Pacific Partnership is approved.n \"That would be a disaster. We wont let it happen.n\" \"But thats just the beginning of what we are going to do for American workers.n\" On taxes we are going to provide massive tax relief to all working people and lower the tax rate on small business from 35% down to 15%. Low and middle-income parents will also be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes.n On regulations I am going to direct every agency and Department Head in my government to identify all needless and job-killing regulations and they will be removed. We will have a temporary moratorium on new regulations to allow our economy to grow and thrive.n Economic growth for last quarter has been revised down to 1.1% a total disaster. Meanwhile our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.n We will further bring back our jobs by unleashing an American energy revolution \u2013 lifting restrictions on oil coal natural gas and all sources of American energy. This will create millions of jobs and lower the price of energy for all families.n We are also going to secure our border to stop the drugs from pouring in. The Seattle-area recently experienced the largest number of heroin-related deaths in 20 years. We have to stop the drugs poisoning our communities.n Another major issue in this race is foreign policy. Hillary Clinton has made one bad foreign policy decision after another \u2013 beginning with her support for going to war in Iraq in the first place which I opposed.n Her tenure as Secretary of State may be regarded as the most disastrous in U.S. history.n Look at the world before and after she became Secretary of State.n Pre-Hillary in early 2009 Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.n Libya was stable.n Syria was under control.n The group we know today as ISIS was close to being extinguished.n Iran was being choked by sanctions.n Now fast-forward to present time.n After Hillary here is what the world looks like:n Iraq is in total chaos.n Syria is in the midst of a disastrous civil war and a refugee crisis now threatens Europe and the United States.n ISIS has been unleashed onto the entire world.n \"Iran \u2013 the worlds top state sponsor of terrorism \u2013 has been put on the path to nuclear weapons and was given a $400 million dollar cash ransom payment.n\" This is the legacy of Hillary Clinton: death destruction and terrorism.n America deserves a better legacy.n All of you deserve a better future. I am the change agent.n Hillary Clinton is the defender of the status quo.n \"While our country lost badly under Hillary Clinton she cashed in big time. Bill Clintons speaking fees surged while Hillary was Secretary of State \u2013 Bill was paid almost $50 million dollars for speeches during her tenure an increase of 44% over the previous 4 years.n\" Then there was all the money funneled into the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments and corporations.n It was pay-for-play. Just look at what she did with UBS or the Russian Uranium or disaster relief in Haiti and so many other examples.n But the only way to learn the full depth of her public corruption is to read the 33000 emails she deleted.n Hillary Clinton said under oath that she turned over all of her work-related emails. But we know that is one more Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she never turned over and then another 15000 emails were just discovered a few weeks ago.n Now today another 30 emails were discovered by the State Department that Hillary Clinton failed to turn over \u2013 these were emails about Benghazi.n It just never ends with the Clintons.n There is only one way to get justice in this rigged system and that is to show up and vote on November 8th \u2013 and to vote big.n \"In A Trump Administration the State Department will work for the country \u2013 not for Hillary Clintons donors.n\" \"Under Hillary Clinton its the powerful protecting the powerful.n\" Politicians defending politicians.n Insiders fighting for insiders.n I am fighting for you.n The government will work for citizens once again.n The era of division will be replaced with a future of unity.n We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common. We will proudly promote our culture as Americans the best in the world.n It is time to break with the failures of the past and to fight for every last child in this country to have the better future they deserve.n This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government a thriving economy and a just society for each and every American.n I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.n Together We Will Make America Wealthy Again.n We Will Make America Strong Again.n We Will Make America Proud Again.n We Will Make America Safe Again.n And We Will Make America Great Again.n Thank you and God Bless.
