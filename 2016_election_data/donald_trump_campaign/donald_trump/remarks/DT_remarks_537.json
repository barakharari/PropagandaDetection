Id like to begin today by thanking all of you for joining me. This has been an incredible journey and weve all done it together. Were almost at the end. \" n \"But were really at the end of the beginning if you think about it. Arent we? The end of the beginning. Our magnificent history movement has surprised the world and defied expectations at every single turn.n\" \"And now next Tuesday we will have one last glorious surprise for the pundits the politicians and the special interests and return the power back to the people. Its going to happen. \" n \"Its going to happen. Its been the honor of my life share this journey with you it has absolutely been. \" n \"There are two people however who I did not really get to share this with but who are in my thoughts often. And thats my mother and my father great people. \" n \"I had great parents. Great parents. I know theyre up there watching I just felt that nice breeze. Its hot but I just felt that nice breeze \" n \"So theyre helping us out. And I just want to say thank you to both of them. Special special people. Ive had a great life and now I want to give back to the country that I love. Its time we have to we have to give back folks \" n \"Ive seen how the career of politicians the big donors and the special interests have bled this country dry and stripped our middle class and stripped our companies of its jobs and its wealth. But were just six days away from delivering justice for every forgotten man woman and child in this country\" n \"Justice for every child trapped in poverty in the inner cities for every family thats born\u2014and you know that theyve been born into a situation in some case; they cant get out of it. Were going to get them out of it. Were going to get them out of it.n\" \"We have endless wars. Every communitys hopes and dreams have been shattered and were not going to let that happen. Our inner cities are going to come back and theyre going to come back strong and your going to see what I mean. \" n \"And the African-American community and the Hispanic community are really understanding whats going on and you see that right now. You see that right now in whats happening at the polls.n\" \"Were winning in Florida were winning in Ohio were winning in Iowa in North Carolina. Were doing great in Pennsylvania. A lot of people are saying Pennsylvanias looking very good. So many different places.n\" We just got a poll with three up in Virginia.  n \"But we are seriously up in Florida. Thats very important \" n And I will never ever let you down. Real change begins immediately with repealing and replacing Obamacare a disaster.  n A disaster.  n \"It is a disaster. Its just been announced that the residents of Florida are going to experience a massive double digit premium hike. \" n \"I will not tell you what the number is. I know the number very well but I want you to leave happy. You dont want to hear the number go home relax wake up good and strong tomorrow morning. Youll learn youre not going to like it.n\" In the great state of Arizona where we just left the premiums are going up more than 116 percent.  n \"Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida and by the way in the primaries I won 66 out of 67 primaries. Thats good. \" n \"I was going to try and exaggerate and say I won them all but I cant do that. Over 90 percent of the counties in Florida are losing Obamacare insurers next year theyre leaving. Theyre all leaving.n\" In Minnesota where the premium increase will be close to 60 percent the Democratic governor has said the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare is a total catastrophe.n Yet Hillary Clinton wants to double down on Obamacare making it even more expensive.  n \"Im asking for your vote so we can replace Obamacare and save healthcare for every family in Florida so important. \" n Real change also means restoring honesty to our government.  n As you know the FBI has reopened its investigation into crooked Hillary Clinton.  n \"Hillary wants to blame everyone else for amounting legal troubles and I dont see if youve watched her last few speeches over the last few days. She has become totally unhinged unbelievable.n\" \"What shes saying and what shes doing is actually its unbelievable. But she has no one to blame but herself. Hillary is the one who set up the illegal private e-mail server to shield her criminal activity.n\" Hillary is the one who engaged in a corrupt pay for play scheme at the State Department. Hillary is the one who lied so many times to Congress and to the FBI. Hilary is the one who made 13 phones disappear some with a hammer and who destroyed 33000 e-mails after after after after receiving a congressional subpoena think of that.  n Unbelievable.  n And as you know they just found\u2014listen to this and I guess you know it 650000 e-mails.  n \"And I would say that classified confidential I think theyre probably all over the place. I think theyre\u2014I think theyre gonna find a treasure trough. I cant even imagine.n\" \"In fact they said well this is OK theyre duplicates. How could there be duplicates when its many more times what we thought was stolen in the first place right?n\" You know when they deleted 33000 I thought that was a lot. They have 650000? Hillary is the one who accepted debate questions given to her in advance and used them to cheat.  n \"Instead of reporting the breach. Thats a big deal. You know to me thats a big deal. Some people say oh thats fine thats a big deal. Thats really\u2014thats a real cheater OK? Thats a cheater.n\" And she was given the questions by a woman that frankly should resigned from the DNC or be fired.  n \"But thats a really big deal. And you notice they never\u2014the dishonest prospect the most dishonest. \" n \"If you notice they never go after Hillary. They always talk about Donna Brazile Donna Brazile didnt do it. But can you imagine if I got\u2014can you imagine they gave the questions to Donald Trump before a debate. \" n \"You know it would be the electric chair. Theyd reinstitute the electric chair. No.n\" \"Itd be headlines all over the world. This isnt headlines.n\" \"I bring it up; its brought up a little bit. But this isnt like a big deal. She got the debate questions and answers.n\" \"But she got the debate questions prior to a debate. Now Bernie Sanders should be angry right? Shouldnt he be angry?n\" \"Now Ill tell you what. The system is rigged. The system is rigged.n\" \"Ive been saying it for a\u2014its rigged and were gonna straighten it out. But the system is rigged. Hillary is not the victim; the American people are the victims of this system. \" n So corrupt in so many ways. And this is your one chance to change it because you know what?n \"In four years not gonna happen. Theres no way. The numbers wont work.n\" \"In four years theres no way. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency. And if she were to be elected it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis.n\" \"I mean before you go into phase two\u2014lets call what happened on Friday phase two. Phase one shes so guilty. She shouldnt be allowed to run for the presidency.n\" \"Thats why I say the system is rigged. She shouldnt be allowed to run. But I have a feeling in the 650000 e-mails theyre gonna find things that you will not even believe.n\" \"Who knows. 650000 e-mails. No wonder she cant do anything.n\" No no. How do you work? How do you do it?n \"650000. Theyll have to explain that to us some day.n\" \"But theyll have some things in there that I can just imagine are going to be unbelievable. Hillarys likely to be under investigation for many years. Probably concluding in a criminal trial.n\" \"Out today WikiLeaks just came out with a new one. Just a little while ago. Its just been shown that a rigged system with more collusion possibly illegal between the Department of Justice the Clinton campaign and the State Department.n\" \"You saw that. The e-mails show that the Assistant Attorney General whos involved in the investigation has been feeding information directly to John Podesta and the Clinton campaign. Can you believe this? \" n \"She shouldnt be allowed to run.n\" By the way behind me the great Johnny Damon. The curse of the Yankees but ultimately he helped the Yankees. Johnny Damon.n Stand up Johnny.  n \"Now Ill tell ya. George Steinbrenner was a good friend of mine. Oh he didnt like Johnny too much.n\" Then he ultimately signed him and then he was fine. He did great.n \"But Johnny Damon was a champ. He was a winner. And he loves this area you know that. My contract with the American voter begins with a tough ethics reform and it ends\u2014Ill tell you what. We are going to end\u2014we have no choice.n\" \"We really have no choice\u2014government corruption. Its going to end. \" n I want the entire corrupt Washington establishment to hear and to heed the words we all will say right now when we win on November 8. We are going to Washington D.C. and we are going to drain the swamp.  n At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs. Florida has lost one in four of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA a deal signed by Bill Clinton with the support of crooked Hillary.  n America has lost\u2014this is so hard to believe\u201470000 factories since China entered the World Trade Organization.n \"Another Bill and Hillary backed disaster. We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world. A Trump administration will stop the jobs from leaving America and we will stop the jobs from leaving Florida. Theyre leaving. Were going to stop itn\" \"And you have an excellent governor by the way. Hes fighting hard for you folks. I dont know\u2014I dont know. All I can tell you is he is a worker he is a worker and hes fighting very hard. The theft of American prosperity will end and itll end Ill tell you. We are\u2014it is being stolen from us folks.n\" \"It is\u2014we have a one-way highway right into Mexico right into other countries. And were going to stop it. From now on its going to be America first. \" n America first.  n \"Its going to be America first. \" n \"A Trump administration will renegotiate NAFTA and we will stand up to foreign product dumping currency manipulation and all of the unfair subsidy behaviors. Its horrible whats happening to us. Our politicians dont have a clue they dont know what theyre doing\u2014or other things OK. We will also immediately stop the job killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. As part of our plan to bring back jobs were going to lower taxes on American business from 35 percent to 15 percent. Were the highest taxed nation in the world. Killing our jobs. Our companies are leaving. Killing our jobs.n\" \"We will become a rich nation once again. But to be a rich nation we must also be a safe nation. In Orlando the murder rate doubled you know that? Doubled last year. Can you believe it? We will support our police and I met you police of Orlando they are unbelievable people and theyve been through a lot.n\" I met the police and these are unbelievable people. We will bring this crime wave to an end. We will also keep our community safe from terrorism. Just a short time ago Orlando was the victim of the worst mass shooting in American history during the Islamic terror attack on The Pulse nightclub.n \"It was also the worst attack on the LGBTQ community in our countrys history. Cant let it happen cant let it happen. Hillary wants to increase by 550 percent Syrian refugees pouring into our country. \" n Her plan would mean generations of terrorism radicalism and extremism spreading in your schools and throughout your communities.n \"When Im elected president we will suspend the Syrian refuge program. \" n And we will keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of your community.  n \"Got to keep them out. And well build safe zones in Syria. We have to help the people. Were going to build safe zones but the Gulf States havent been doing their thing.n\" \"And believe me they have plenty of money. Theyll help us theyll fund it Im sure theyll be thrilled. Theyre going to be funding it and that will be OK. We want to help people. But we have enough problems in this country. We dont need Orlando and problems. We dont need what happened in San Bernadino.n\" \"We dont need whats happening in Paris in Nice and in Germany\u2014which is a disaster. We dont need it. We have enough problems right now do we agree? We have enough problems. We dont need it. A Trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the United States. \" n And yes we will build a great wall.  n \"We received the first ever endorsement from our ICE and border patrol officers great people. The officers that warned that Hillarys plan is the most quote radical immigration proposal in United States history and that it will lead to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives quote.n\" \"As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of the most dangerous and violent criminal aliens to go free because their home countries were intelligent they wouldnt take them back.n\" \"We bring them to their countries\u2014murderers drug dealers gang members wed bring them to their countries and their countries would say: get them out were not taking them back. They call up the State Department and the State Department under Hillary Clinton would say: oh bring them back we dont want to make waves.n\" \"I guarantee you whether its four years or eight years that will not happen once under a Trump administration. \" n Hillary wants totally open borders and strongly supports sanctuary cities. Like San Francisco where Kate Steinle\u2014incredible young woman\u2014was murdered by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.n A Trump administration will cancel all federal funding to sanctuary cities immediately. We will end illegal immigration deport all criminal aliens\u2014the ones we just spoke about\u2014and we will save American lives. We will also repeal Obama-Clinton defense sequester and rebuild our very badly depleted military.  n \"That includes major new investments in resources from Pensacola Naval Air Station at MacDill Air Force Base. Have you ever heard of those places? Pretty good places. A lot of people here lot of people. Im honored to have the endorsement of 200\u2014more than that now much more than that\u2014top Admirals and Generals and 22 Medal of Honor recipients.n\" \"Great people Ive met so many of them theyre incredible. Incredible people. Our new foreign policy will put America first. Hillary and our failed Washington establishment have spend $6 trillion on wars in the Middle East that we never won and that never end. And its now in worse shape than ever before.n\" \"The Middle East is a catastrophe its far worse off than had we spent nothing.n\" \"Theyve dragged us into foreign wars that have made us less safe. Theyve left our borders wide open at home. And theyve shipped our jobs and wealth to other countries. And its\u2014its disappearing. Our country in a certain sense is disappearing. Prosperity\u2014real prosperity is disappearing. We owe $20 trillion. Our trade deals we lose $800 billion a year on trade. We have trade deficits. Think of that. Who negotiates these deals?n\" You know who does? Stupid people. Stupid people.  n \"With very stupid leadership. Who by the way they campaign all the time. Hes campaigning right now for crooked Hillary. \" n \"Why is he campaigning? Shes under federal investigation and weve got a president campaigning for her. And thats all he does is campaign. He ought to be working on your jobs that are leaving and going to Mexico. And your military. \" n \"Ill tell you what first of all shes got bigger problems. But four more years of Obama we cant take it folks. Four more years of ISIS thats what it is. Four more years of no jobs.n\" \"Now she wants to start a shooting war in Syria and conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia that could very well lead to World War III. Russia is heavily armed doesnt like her. Putin does not respect her doesnt like her. What are we doing folks? Shes a mess.n\" \"To all Americans I say its time for new leadership. \" n Just think about what we can accomplish in the first 100 days of a Trump administration.  n \"Thank you. Its so beautiful over there. I just noticed the water. Lets go in for a swim. Its about 200 degrees out there.n\" \"Anybody want to go swimming? Lets go. \" n \"We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. And Hillary wants to increase your taxes by a tremendous amount. You know were already the highest-taxed nation in the world. She wants to increase your taxes if you can believe that one.n\" \"Were going to eliminate every unnecessary job-killing regulation. Killing your companies. Killing them. One of the reasons theyre leaving. Cancel every illegal Obama executive order. \" n \"Were going to rebuild our military and take care of our great great veterans. Theyre not being taken care of. You know that. A lot of veterans here. Were going to take care of our veterans finally. They have been mistreated for many many years.n\" \"Were going to support the men and women of law enforcement. \" n We will save the Second Amendment which is as you know under tremendous siege.  n We will appoint justices to the United States Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.  n \"We will show the world that there is no challenge too great no dream outside of our reach. Theres no dream\u2014no dream outside of our reach. We have all these people telling us what to do. Politicians\u2014they know nothing. Ive dealt with them all my life folks. All talk no action.n\" \"I have some friends that are politicians. So let me just say theres some good ones. OK? There are some good.n\" \"Ill tell you what you take a look at the media. These are the most dishonest people anywhere. \" n \"These are the most\u2014they\u2014the media\u2014the media is a part and one of the vital cogs in the rigged system under which we live. Theyre a big fat cog in the\u2014and they never show the crowds. They never show whats happening.n\" \"But you know what? You hear\u2014when you hear 20000 sometimes 30000 when you hear people sounds like youre at an Ohio State football game. \" n But they never show it. They never show it.  n They never show it.n People of Florida we love you. All we have to do is cut our ties with these failed politicians of the past. Hillary is a candidate of yesterday. We are the movement of the future. We are.  n Were asking for the votes of Republicans Democrats independents and first-time voters of which were finding out there are many. You probably heard over the last couple of weeks \"Texas is in play\"; \"Texas\u2014that Georgia is in play.\" And Im saying \"Gee thats too bad.\"n \"Let me tell you theyre setting records in Texas and theyre voting for Trump just so you understand that. \" n And they know it.  n \"But when they see those numbers coming they dont want to announce them. But we are winning almost everywhere. I think\u2014give us two more days I think were going to be winning everywhere. \" n \"And Im almost starting to think that the least important problem that Hillary has is the fact that were winning. I think shes got perhaps bigger problems than even that. \" n \"Were fighting for every citizen who believes that government should serve the people not the donors and nor Hillarys special interests. \" n We are fighting to unlock the potential of every American community and every American family who hope and pray and yearn for a much better future.  n I am asking you to dream big\u2014I got to dream big. Because with your vote we are just\u2014can you believe this?\u2014six days away. Think of that.  n \"From the change youve been waiting for your entire life. \" n \"Were going to work together.
