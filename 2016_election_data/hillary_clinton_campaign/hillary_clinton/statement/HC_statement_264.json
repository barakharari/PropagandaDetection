{"text": "    \"Abusive payday lenders have for too long been a drain on the resources of families in need charging outrageous fees and interest rates trapping families in never-ending cycles of debt and subjecting them to brutal debt collection practices. Today the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \u2013 a government watchdog dedicated solely to protecting working Americans from unfair and deceptive financial practices \u2013 is putting forward an important proposal to crack down on abusive payday lending and I stand with them in that effort. \"This is an important point of contrast in this campaign. Donald Trump wants to strip the U.S. governments power to apply rules to payday lenders abolish this critical consumer watchdog and roll back the other Wall Street reforms that we put in place after the financial crisis. Working families deserve a president who will look out for them \u2013 not payday lenders and special interests on Wall Street.\" ", "date": "2016-06-02"}
