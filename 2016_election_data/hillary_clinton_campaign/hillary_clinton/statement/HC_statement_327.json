{"text": "\"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the Working Families Party. \"Working families are the engine behind our economy the heart of our democracy and the core of what makes America great. But today its too hard for working people to get ahead and stay ahead. \"Thats why the Working Families Party is so important. For almost two decades they have fought to make our economy fairer and our country stronger. Theyve fought to raise the minimum wage in states and cities across the country; combat climate change and create new good-paying jobs in clean energy and energy efficiency; and train and elect trailblazing progressive leaders. \"As President Ill stand with working families like I have my entire career. Well build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top and finally make the minimum wage a living wage. Well overturn Citizens United and protect every Americans right to vote not every corporations right to buy elections. Well end the era of mass incarceration and replace the school-to-prison pipeline with a cradle-to-college and career pipeline. Well make sure every American can afford a college education and tackle our countrys student debt crisis. And well finally enact policies that support how families actually live and work today\u2014with paid family leave affordable childcare and equal pay for women. \"Together well fight every day for working families\u2014because we know when families are strong America is strong.\" ", "date": "2016-08-16"}
