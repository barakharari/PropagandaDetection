{"text": "\"Donald Trumps use of a blatantly anti-Semitic image from racist websites to promote his campaign would be disturbing enough but the fact that its a part of a pattern should give voters major cause for concern. Now not only wont he apologize for it hes peddling lies and blaming others. Trump should be condemning hate not offering more campaign behavior and rhetoric that engages extremists. The president should be someone who brings Americans together not someone who sends signals and offers policies of division.\" ", "date": "2016-07-04"}
