{"text": "\"I am honored to have earned the endorsement of the AFL-CIO. \"The AFL-CIO is one of Americas most vital organizations having been on the front lines of the fight for good-paying jobs and careers with benefits and dignity for more than a century. AFL-CIO member unions contribute to virtually every sector of our economy and are on the job in every corner of our country\u2014building our infrastructure teaching our children sowing our fields operating our ports and entertaining us on stage and screen. \"Members of the AFL-CIO know as I do that we are stronger together. We are stronger when we are investing in our country and our future. As President I will make the biggest investment in infrastructure since the Interstate Highway System\u2014because to build a 21st century economy we need 21st century roads ports transit systems water systems and electric grids. We will fight for good schools in every ZIP code\u2014because all of our children deserve a chance to live up to their God-given potential. And we will fight to raise the federal minimum wage back to the highest its ever been to finally join all other industrial nations in guaranteeing paid family leave for workers and at last secure equal pay for women. \"And we know we are stronger when we have each others backs. Workers rights to organize to bargain collectively to be safe on the job and to retire with dignity and security after years of hard work are fundamental to our country and to our economy. In too many statehouses across the country\u2014and even in the halls of Congress\u2014these rights are under concerted attack by Republicans and big corporations who have forgotten that a strong economy requires a strong workforce. As President I will stand proudly with the AFL-CIO and fight to protect the rights and values that helped build the mighty American middle class. Workers will always have a seat at the table and a champion in the White House\u2014because when unions are strong workers are strong and when workers are strong America is strong.\" ", "date": "2016-06-16"}
