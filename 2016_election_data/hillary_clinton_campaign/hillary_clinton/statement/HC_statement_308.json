{"text": "\"Tonight Donald Trump painted a dark picture of an America in decline. And his answer \u2013 more fear more division more anger more hate \u2013 was yet another reminder that he is temperamentally unfit and totally unqualified to be President of the United States. He offered no real solutions to help working families get ahead or to keep our country safe just more prejudice and paranoia. America is better than this. America is better than Donald Trump. Next week in Philadelphia Democrats will focus on issues not anger. Well offer a positive vision for the future based on lifting America up not tearing Americans down.\" ", "date": "2016-07-21"}
