{"text": "\"For over 70 years the Association of Flight Attendants has helped raise wages benefits and working conditions for its members all across \u2013 and above \u2013 America. Over the decades it has brought our nations attention to important issues like discrimination outsourcing and equal pay. Every American worker deserves an advocate like the AFA in their corner and Im honored to have earned their endorsement. \"Throughout my career the AFA and I have partnered to fight for fairer labor standards. In the Senate I led the effort to ensure AFA members had access to Family and Medical Leave Act benefits. And weve always stood up for women who have been treated unequally in the workforce. \"The stakes in this election could not be higher. Donald Trump stood on a debate stage and said that wages are too high in this country. He opposes policies that would make it easier for people to balance work and family including guaranteeing paid leave for all families and working for equal pay for women. He even personally hired a union-busting firm to keep workers at his hotel in Las Vegas from organizing. \"If Im elected in November labor will always have a champion in the White House. Together well build an economy that works for everyone not just those at the top. Well say no to bad trade deals no to attacks on workers and no to discriminatory and sexist policies. And Im glad to know the AFA will be at my side as we stand up for American workers.\" ", "date": "2016-09-30"}
