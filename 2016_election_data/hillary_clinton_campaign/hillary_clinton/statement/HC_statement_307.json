{"text": "\"The loss of Congressman Mark Takai will be felt keenly from Washington to Honolulu. Mark was everything a public servant should be. He spent his entire life in service of his state and his country\u2013from the Hawaii Army National Guard to the Hawaii State House to the House of Representatives\u2013fighting to make sure veterans and their families are supported supporting ambitious steps to protect his state and our planet from the perils of climate change and championing the rights of Asian American Pacific Islander and Native Hawaiian communities. I am grateful to Mark for his friendship and deeply honored to have earned his support. My thoughts and prayers are with Marks family and friends and especially with his wife Sami and his children Matthew and Kaila.\" ", "date": "2016-07-20"}
