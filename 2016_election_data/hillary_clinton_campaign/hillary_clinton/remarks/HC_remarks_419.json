{"text": "\"Hello Miami Dade College! It is so great to be here with all of you. \"And I want to thank everyone for gathering and in particular I want to thank all of the elected officials. Thanks to Congressman Patrick Murphy who I hope is the next senator from Florida. Thanks to Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Thank you to Mayor Phillip Levine of Miami Beach. Thanks to Mayor Phillip Stoddard of South Miami. Thanks to all the others who were part of the program. As we were coming in we heard lots of energy coming from this crowd and I was told as I was coming out theres an overflow but they can hear us in the overflow and were so happy youre here as well! So thanks to the overflow crowd. But what I am most excited about is to be here with one of the worlds most foremost leaders on climate change: Al Gore.\" \"About a decade ago Al made a movie called An Inconvenient Truth. Now maybe some of you have seen it but if you havent I hope youll watch it tonight. It doesnt have a lot of special effects \u2013 but it does have a lot of drama.\" \"And heres the main message: climate change is real its urgent and America can take the lead in the world in addressing it. Right? We here in America can develop new clean energy solutions. We can transform our economy. We can rally the world to cut carbon pollution. And above all we can fulfill our moral obligation to protect our planet for our children and our grandchildren.\" \"Now let me just say \u2013 so so lets remember lets remember whats at stake. Im running against a guy who denies science denies climate change claims its a hoax created by the Chinese. So this is something that Al Gores been working on for a really long time. And I want you to know how far back he goes. It was in 1982 when he held the very first hearing on climate change in the House of Representatives with the world-famous climate scientist Jim Hansen. And then when Al became a senator he continued to raise the alarm and look for solutions and as vice president he led Americas efforts to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions. You take all this together those 30 years of leadership led Al Gore to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.\" I was very proud because he had been determined and persistent and in the face of a lot of people \u2013 in public life in business in elsewhere who were trying to diminish the importance of the science \u2013 he never wavered. And in the years since the climate challenge has only grown more stark. And I will tell you this it is one of the most important issues at stake in this election. Look at it this way. Our next president will either step up our efforts to address climate change to protect our planet to protect our health and to create good jobs that cannot be outsourced by growing our clean energy economy. Or in the alternative we will be dragged backwards and our whole future will be put at risk. \"So weve really got to get this right. And if you need additional convincing just remember what happened this week. Hurricane Matthew killed at least 26 people in our country more than a thousand as far as we know right now in Haiti. North Carolina is still dealing with serious flooding and will be at least for the rest of the week if not longer. We all need to support each other as our communities put the pieces back together and begin the long road back from this disaster.\" \"Thats why Ive encouraged everyone to give what you can afford to the Florida Disaster Fund or to Team Rubicon the veterans organization working to respond to Hurricane Matthew or to UNICEF helping children and families on the ground in Haiti.\" \"Now some will say Weve always had hurricanes. Theyve always been destructive. And thats true. But Hurricane Matthew was likely more destructive because of climate change. Right now the ocean is at or near record-high temperatures \u2013 and that contributed to the torrential rainfall and the flash flooding that we saw in the Carolinas. Sea levels have already risen about a foot \u2013 one foot \u2013 in much of the Southeast which means that Matthews storm surge was higher and the flooding was more severe.\" \"Plus as you know the impact of climate change goes beyond extreme events like hurricanes. Its become a daily reality here in Miami. You have streets in Miami Beach and in Shorecrest that are flooding at high tide. The ocean is bubbling up through the sewer system. Sometimes people call 311 because they assume a water main must have broken when actually it is the sea rising around them.\" \"So if you need proof that climate change is real and that its costly there you go. So at this rate at this rate my friends my friends please. Lets focus on whats really important in this election and in your future and the future of our country because this is what I want you to hear and understand. At the rate we are going one in eight homes in Florida could be underwater by the end of the century and when kids \u2013 like that adorable young boy over there on his dads shoulders \u2013 are grandparents we believe thats more than $400 billion worth of property in Florida at risk and nationwide its as much as $882 billion in property at risk.\" \"But theres also health consequences. Mosquitoes that carry diseases like the Zika virus and ticks that carry Lyme disease are expanding their ranges. And hotter summers and longer pollen seasons are making allergies and asthma worse which is especially bad for our children. And look at what is happening in California a brutal five-year drought. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres in our country last year.\" \"And its also about national security. The Pentagon has identified climate change as a threat to our Americas national security. The U.S. Atlantic Fleet is based in Norfolk Virginia. Its the largest naval installation in the world. And because of rising sea level the base is frequently flooded even when its sunny. So thats why the Pentagon is looking at how climate change will affect readiness and operations not just in Norfolk but at all of our military bases around the world.\" \"So you would think if you look at the facts if you listen to the science that even the most committed climate skeptic would say Ok I agree somethings happening here. We need to take it seriously.\" \"But unfortunately there are still plenty of people \u2013 in Washington on the campaign trail \u2013 who wont face whats happening right in front of us.\" \"Donald Trump is quote not a big believer in climate change. As I said he said its a hoax created by the Chinese. And in our first debate two weeks ago he tried to deny saying that. But that tweet is still there for everyone to see.\" \"And I would wish that Donald would actually listen to people here in Florida like Miami Beachs Mayor Philip Levine and others who are doing incredible work to address these Sunny Day Floods. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alem\u00e1n. Or maybe he would listen to Miami Beach Commissioner John Elizabeth Alem\u00e1n. John Elizabeth is a Republican but shes supporting our campaign\u2014because she knows America cant afford a candidate who doesnt accept climate science. Or maybe Donald would listen to our military leaders who say climate change threatens our national security or what about the ranchers in Colorado or the mayors in Arizona or the community leaders in Alaska who say Our lives and jobs and families are being affected \u2013 please lets come together as a country and do something about it.\" We cannot risk putting a climate denier in the White House. At all that is absolutely unacceptable. We need a president who believes in science and who has a plan to lead America in facing this threat creating good jobs and yes saving our planet. \"So heres what I want to do.\" First we need to do a lot more on clean energy. The clean energy superpower of the 21st century is probably going to be either Germany China or us\u2014and I want it to be us. And I want you to be part of making it us. And we need to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy and create high paying jobs building and installing more solar panels and wind turbines. Modernizing our electric grid. Retrofitting buildings. Building resilient 21st century infrastructure and we have to make sure no community is left out or left behind\u2014not our cities or our small towns or our remote rural areas. \"Now you wouldnt know it if you only listened to my opponent talk about how terrible everything is. He has such a dark divisive view of America but that doesnt tell the story about whats really going on. Its actually pretty exciting. In red states and blue states local leaders are stepping up. Rural electric co-ops are investing in community solar power and you see that across America \u2013 union workers in Michigan union workers in Michigan are getting ready to build electric Chevys in a plant powered by clean energy. Iowa Iowa is already getting a third of its electricity from wind. Wind turbines are going up in New England and on Lake Erie. Renewable energy is already the fastest-growing source of new jobs in America. I think that is so exciting \u2013 there are nearly 2 million people already working in energy efficiency.\" And in Spartanburg South Carolina a project called ReGenesis is taking an old landfill and turning it into a solar farm. That landfill was a blight and a health threat just 250 feet away from a residential neighborhood. Now that same land will generate enough clean renewable electricity to power 500 homes. \"So this is what we can do. And I think Washington should back up and support doing more of that. As president I want us to have 500 million solar panels installed across America by the end of my first term. And lets generate enough renewable energy to power every home in America within the decade. Lets make our buildings and factories more energy efficient and cut our oil consumption by one-third.\" And we can get there by investing in cutting edge research to keep developing cheaper and better clean energy technologies investing in clean energy infrastructure and advanced manufacturing putting big partnerships together between states cities and rural communities. \"We can do all of this and create millions of good-paying jobs as we do. So Im hoping that these good jobs will offer security and dignity while we produce the clean energy that will power the economy of the future. The clean energy solutions are being developed right here in America. We want them manufactured in America installed in America and putting people to work in America.\" \"And while we do that lets make sure our communities are ready for the impacts of climate change that are coming right at us. We need to invest in resilient infrastructure. Now sometimes that will mean building a seawall; other times lets be more creative \u2013 like in New York Harbor where we are replanting oyster beds to form natural barriers to storm surge. Sometimes well overhaul an outdated sewer system to deal with flooding from heavy downpours. In Philadelphia theyre trying something else: green roofs porous pavements curbside gardens to help absorb storm water.\" \"And heres something we dont talk enough about. Lets make sure our hospitals can stay open and operational in any kind of disaster. Because sadly I saw what happened in New York during Hurricane Sandy newborns who had been on respirators had to be evacuated down nine flights of stairs in one New York hospital because the electricity went off. Nurses I love nurses \u2013 heroic courageous nurses were carrying those babies and manually squeezing bags of air to keep them breathing. Now here in Miami you know how important this is. You have retrofitted the Nicklaus Childrens Hospital with a hurricane-resistant shell for exactly this reason. And every hospital in the country should follow your lead and build in more resilience.\" \"And then finally we have got to lead the world to confront the climate challenge. If we dont do it nobody will do it. We must confront the climate challenge. Theres no doubt about that. And so lets move on with the kind of leadership that the world as well as our country deserves.\" \"When I was Secretary of State I worked with President Obama to make climate change a top diplomatic priority. We fought to get China and India and other major polluters to agree for the first time in history to be part of the solution. In fact we had to crash a secret meeting in Copenhagen Denmark \u2013 slip past the guards \u2013 it was all very cloak and dagger. But for a really important purpose and because of that breakthrough and a lot of patient persistent work and because of American leadership 195 nations signed on to a global agreement last December. Its called the Paris Agreement. And I am not exaggerating when I say it is our last best chance to solve the global climate crisis.\" \"And what does Donald Trump want to do? He wants to cancel the Paris Agreement. He doesnt care what it would do to the planet. He doesnt care how much that would damage American leadership in the world. He doesnt care what it would do to the future we leave our kids and our grandkids.\" \"Well he may not care \u2013 but we do. And thats why this election is so critically important because on the ballot it is not just my name. Its every issue we care about its our values as a country.\" Climate change needs to be a voting issue. We need to elect people up and down the ballot at every level of government who take it seriously and are willing to roll up their sleeves and get something done. Please we cannot keep sending climate deniers and defeatists to Congress or to state houses\u2014and certainly not to the White House. \"And if you care about climate your Senate race is also really important and Ill tell you why. It is unacceptable it is an unacceptable response for Marco Rubio when asked about climate change to say Im not a scientist. Well why doesnt he ask a scientist and then maybe then hed understand why it is so important that he representing Florida be committed to climate change? Thats why I hope that youll elect Patrick Murphy to the United States Senate.\" \"Look we need leaders who can get results. Its easy to stonewall. Its not enough to protest: we need creativity we need hard work. And when it comes to climate change we dont have a minute to waste.\" \"So I know its easy to get cynical\u2014especially about our politics. I get that. But this election matters more than any has in a really long time and I believe that as strongly as I can weve got to address this issue for our sakes our children our grandchildren. And its so critically important when you think about how leadership can make a difference.\" And just look if you will \u2013 look at the difference between your state the Sunshine State which has less solar energy than New Jersey has right now. And do you know why? Because you have a governor who has ordered the state government never to use the words climate change. So my friends this is a big deal in the election and it is going to be a big deal for our country and our world. And there isnt anybody \u2013 there isnt anybody who knows more has done more has worked harder. I know he was in Miami just last year training and educating people to be climate change activists. I cant wait to have Al Gore advising me when I am President of the United States. So please join me in welcoming our former vice president a climate change leader and an all-around great guy Al Gore.\" ", "date": "2016-10-11"}
