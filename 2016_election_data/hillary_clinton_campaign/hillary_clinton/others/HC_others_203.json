{"text": "\"I firmly believe that if you spent your life keeping the lights on for our country we cant leave you in the dark.xa0In this campaign Ive talked a lot about the United States becoming the clean energy superpower of the 21 \"xa0century. Were not going to make that happen without a sensible transition that works for people and for our country. We need to use every tool we have to build a 21\" \"xa0century energy future that doesnt leave anyone out or behind.\" \"That includes supporting safe and responsible natural gas production and nuclear energy and the thousands of jobs that come with it including good-paying union jobs. Proposals to end natural gas production or rapidly shut down our nations nuclear power fleet put ideology ahead of science and would make it harder and more costly to build a clean energy future. \"And it means we need to support our coal miners their families and their communities. Coal will remain a part of the energy mix for years to come and we have a shared responsibility to ensure that coal communities receive the benefits they have earned\u2014and can build the future they deserve. Thats what my plan does by safeguarding retirement and healthcare benefits and school funding creating good-paying jobs in infrastructure reclaiming and repurposing abandoned mining sites expanding broadband and investing in hydropower and clean energy. And I will launch a Coal Communities Challenge Fund to support the locally-driven economic development in health care housing and small business that is happening by coal communities for coal communities.\" ", "date": "2016-03-14"}
