{"text": "\"Bernie Sanders has been seeking the presidency for nearly a year. It cant be a surprise to him that serving as Commander-in-Chief is a critical part of the job. Were therefore deeply troubled by his continued lack of interest in and knowledge of essential foreign policy and national security issues. His recent interview with the New York Daily News demonstrates this problem anew. \"Senator Sanders was asked specific \u2013 but not unexpected or unusual \u2013 questions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He couldnt answer but said that if he had some paper in front of him he might be able to. He was asked his opinion on key parts of the Obama Administrations counter-terrorism strategy. Again he couldnt answer. Thats concerning especially just a few weeks after the attack in Brussels. The same goes for what he said about how hed go about interrogating captured terrorists if he were President. xa0Actually I havent thought about it a whole lot he said. Thats surprising to say the least \u2013 particularly given the dangerous proposals were hearing from Republicans on using torture and keeping the Guantanamo Bay detention facility open. \"These were not gotcha questions. As people who have advised presidents on critical issues like these we know how important it is to have a Commander-in-Chief who has a deep grasp of them \u2013 or who at the very least takes them seriously enough to reach beyond the basics. We respect Senator Sanderss passion for building a better America but we are troubled by his continued inability to articulate a vision of our nations role in the world. \"Many of us raised concerns earlier this year that Senator Sanders had not thought through crucial national security issues. His interview with the New York Daily News shows that hes made no effort to change that. America needs a President who has given serious thought to how she or he would approach the serious challenges were facing and who will be ready to lead on day one.\" Jeremy B.
