{"text": "\"Todays vote in the House is a jarring reminder of the stakes in 2016.\" Their votes will   change the law. More than 18 million people will   lose the health insurance they gained through the Affordable Care Act. The millions of women who depend on Planned Parenthood for health care will   lose access to lifesaving preventive care including cancer screenings well-woman exams HIV tests and more. \"But a year from now a new president will be sworn in. If that president is a Republican todays votes would have had a very different outcome\u2014because every single Republican running for president wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood.\" He or she would sign the bill and take us back to the days when insurers could charge women more than men for the exact same coverage or deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions. He or she would deny funding to a trusted health care provider that is often the only place that women can get the critical health services they need. \"Republicans would rip away the progress weve made. And there are only two things standing in their way: a Democratic president\u2014and you.\" ", "date": "2016-01-06"}
