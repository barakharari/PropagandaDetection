{"text": "Well played Abbi and Ilana. In the latest episode of Comedy Centrals \"Broad City\"?a show about a best-friend duo navigating post-college life in New York Ilana Glazers character spends the day volunteering for Hillary Clintons campaign. On her way out the door she and her best friend Abbi run into a surprise guest. \"The episode wasnt actually filmed at campaign headquarters in Brooklyn\u2014but the shows producers certainly captured the office vibe. Heres what they got right (and wrong).\" The \"H\" wall featured in last nights episode is a dead ringer for the one at HQ\u2014right down to the Post-its. \"Whats on the Post-its? Dozens of handwritten reminders from staffers and visitors about the things were fighting for.\" Filing cabinets double as standing desks and the hallways are pop-up conference rooms. What can we say? The hours are long. ", "date": "2016-03-17"}
