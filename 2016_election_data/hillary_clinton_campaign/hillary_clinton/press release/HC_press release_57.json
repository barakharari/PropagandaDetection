{"text": "\"Test your knowledge of our nations gun laws.\" There are many ways a gun can fall into the hands of a dangerous individual\u2014and some of them are perfectly legal. \"In 1993 President Bill Clinton signed the Brady Bill which requires licensed federal gun dealers to run a background check on anyone who attempts to purchase a gun. However thanks to the NRAs lobbying efforts the bill includes a loophole stating that if the FBI cannot process the background check within three days the dealer can legally sell the gun to the buyer\u2014regardless of the persons record.\" The shooter who slaughtered nine people in a South Carolina church bought his weapon thanks to this so-called Charleston loophole. Licensed gun dealers are required to conduct a background check before each gun purchase\u2014but many private sellers are not. That means guns sold over the internet or at gun shows are rarely regulated.  According to the best data available as much as 40 percent of annual gun sales occur without a background check because the sale occurs over the internet at a gun show or are person-to-person sales. Federal law does not bar those the FBI suspects are terrorists from buying a weapon. The U.S. Senate recently had a chance to close this loophole\u2014 Even though federal law prohibits felons from purchasing or possessing guns that prohibition does not apply to many convicted stalkers\u2014because federal law does not prohibit people convicted of misdemeanor stalking offenses from buying guns. \"Hillary has always stood up to the gun lobby\u2014and as president shell work to close these outrageous loopholes while protecting the rights of responsible gun owners.\" \"Learn more about Hillarys plan to address gun violence\" ", "date": "2016-01-21"}
