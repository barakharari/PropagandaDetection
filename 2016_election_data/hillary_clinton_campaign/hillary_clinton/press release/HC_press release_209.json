{"text": "The fate of the court hinges on the next election. President Obama has nominated Judge Merrick Garland to fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia. \"Within minutes of the presidents announcement Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to deny this qualified widely respected jurist a hearing or a vote.\" \"Its yet another reminder of whats at stake in this election. As we wait to see whether Republicans in the U.S. Senate will do their jobs and fulfill their constitutional responsibility keep one thing in mind:\" \"Heres what is at stake:\" \"The Supreme Court recently held oral arguments from an abortion case from Texas\u2014and the states access to safe and legal abortion hangs in the balance. Every leading Republican presidential candidate opposes abortion and some even oppose exceptions for rape incest or to protect a womans health. And many would overturn \"  to make that happen.  gutted one of the most important parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a decision that has fueled a coordinated Republican-led attack on the voting rights of people of color low-income people students and seniors in recent years. (Ted Cruz has been one of the biggest cheerleaders for this decision.) A conservative court could erode voting rights even further. \"The historic Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality was decided in a 5?4 split. A shift in the balance of power on the bench would provide the conservative wing of the court an opportunity to reverse that decision\u2014an opportunity that a Republican president would be happy to give them (remember every Republican candidate in this race denounced the Supreme Courts affirmation of marriage equality).\" \"The Supreme Courts ruling in \" \" allows corporations to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence federal elections. Its a decision that has plenty of fans in the Republican Party.\" \"Since that 2010 ruling the conservative-led court has declined to revisit that decision. Thats why Hillary has promised to do whatever it takes to overturn this ruling\u2014including by fighting for a constitutional amendment.\" \"The Affordable Care Act has now survived two attempts to strike it down in the Supreme Court\u2014but there are more challenges to the law making their way through the lower courts. John Kasich and Ted Cruz have spoken out against the courts Affordable Care Act rulings\u2014and you can bet the justices theyd appoint would lead the charge against the law.\" \"Twenty-six states have brought a lawsuit against President Obamas executive actions (known as DACA/DAPA) to let DREAMers and parents remain in the United States. The Supreme Court will hear the case in this year. That matters\u2014because every leading Republican presidential candidate wants to end the executive actions that would keep millions of families together.\" ", "date": "2016-03-17"}
