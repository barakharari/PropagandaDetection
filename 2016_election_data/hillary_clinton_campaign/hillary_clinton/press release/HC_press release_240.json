{"text": "We need Hillary. When I announced that I would lead the effort to change the culture around mental health to address stigma and the way our city delivers mental health services\u2014a tough issue that has historically been ignored\u2014Hillary was one of the first to express enthusiasm and to offer me advice about how to make sure everyone is included in  \". I wasnt surprised.\" \"Thats probably why from the very beginning Hillary recognized a truth that many would rather ignore: So many of the challenges facing American families are rooted in inequality. That is why throughout her career she has fought for policies that address the root causes of inequality.\" \"The need for her leadership on this issue has never been more urgent especially for African Americans. The typical African American family has just 8 cents of wealth for every dollar held by a typical white family. Eight cents. And its even less for African American women.\" That has to change\u2014and it starts by fighting for equal pay. That is why Hillary as senator helped pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. But equal pay is just a start. We also need to give hardworking Americans a raise. \"Back in January my husband Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a $15-dollar minimum wage for all city government employees. And on Monday our states minimum wage was raised to $15 dollars. Now we need other states to follow our lead.\" It is also high time for us to provide every American with access to paid sick leave and paid family leave. Because no one should be forced to choose between the health of their family and their next paycheck. \"Doing that wont be easy. I know because weve already done it extending paid family leave to 20000 city employees and sick leave to a half-million more New Yorkers.\" Now we need to make sure every family has access to these crucial resources. Doing that will take more than a vision. It will take a plan and meticulous follow up and execution. \"And lets not forget early childhood education\u2014a passion that Hillary and I have long shared. Universal pre-k is in its second year here in New York City and I know that Hillary is eager to extend universal pre-kindergarten to the rest of the country.\" In New York City we have a bold vision to address inequality. And we have plans to make that vision a reality. Our city and our country would benefit greatly if we had a progressive president in the White House. That is why we need Hillary. No one is better prepared to help us with our mission. No one is better prepared to help our working families. \"She has what it takes\u2014and she wont stop until the work is done.\" ", "date": "2016-04-09"}
